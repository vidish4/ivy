Maestro (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Carey Mulligan|Bradley Cooper|Matt Bomer|Vincenzo Amato|Greg Hildreth|Michael Urie|Brian Klugman|Nick Blaemire|Mallory Portnoy|Alexandra Santini|Jarrod LaBine|Sarah Silverman|Kate Eastman|William Hill|Valéry Lessard|Renée Stork|Tim Rogan|Sara Sanderson,Bradley Cooper,Bradley Cooper|Josh Singer,This love story chronicles the lifelong relationship of conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.," Beautiful to look at, gorgeous music, but no story.: I went to Maestro expecting a film that would chronicle the life of one of America's, if not the world's, great composer/conductors. I've seen Leonard Bernstein many, many times, starting at age 8 when my grandfather took me to Bernstein's music for kids on Saturday mornings at Lincoln Center. I had no idea who he was at the time, only that people called him Lenny. My grandpa took me to meet him and he was spellbinding. I remember him looking right threw me with his expressive eyes.He loved kids and loved to teach them about music. Turns out grandpa and Lenny went to Harvard together, hence I got a personal introduction. Bernstein is the guy that got me hooked on classical music and music in general, but I didn't learn anything about his musical career, his childhood, his years at Harvard, his work in Europe, who inspired him, etc.The making of West Side Story is really interesting (if you know the story) but nothing about it in this film and I mean ""nothing.; We get a tiny glimpse of Candide, but nothing about its composition or insight into the Maestro's process. We get zero insight into his Missa Brevis, perhaps on the highlights of his career.Bradley Cooper blew me away. I've seen Lenny up close many times and I've talked to him a few times. Cooper nailed it, and the scene at St John of the Divine is probably one of the greatest musical scenes ever captured on film. Cooper's conducting is simply amazing. He worked very very hard to capture the speech, mannerisms, and the Bernstein attitude and texture toward music. I cannot speak highly enough of Cooper's performance, but we get so little insight into the musician, and that was so disappointing.Carey Mulligan? Her performance is nothing less than spectacular, in fact all the acting is extraordinary, but it's not a story. The Bernstein children really have nothing to do in this film, and I have no idea why Lenny's sister was included as she has very little to say or do. Overall, a very perplexing film ... not sure what he was going for. In fact, I kept waiting for it to start. The emphasis was all on style, and believe me, it's beautiful to look at.~rich-fouts rated 6/10 on 14 December 2023"," Showcases Everything Least Interesting About Bernstein's Life: When Amy Schumer was roasting the film ""Being the Ricardos"" at the Oscars a couple of years ago, she was making fun of Aaron Sorkin for writing a screenplay about the most iconic female comedian of all time that didn't have a single funny moment. She compared it to making a biopic about Michael Jordan and only showing the bus trips between games.Bradley Cooper, pay attention. Why did you choose to make a movie about Leonard Bernstein, arguably one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century, and then focus on all of the most mundane aspects of his life? Do we need yet another movie about a famous person bogged down with scene after scene of them squabbling with their spouse? If you don't already know why Bernstein is so legendary, you're not going to learn it here. You might not even come away from the movie knowing what Bernstein wrote, because the film tosses out titles quickly and casually as it's rushing to get to the next scene of Cooper overacting and Carey Mulligan looking strained as all long-suffering wives in all biopics ever made must do. You don't see him developing any projects or working with collaborators. The movie implies that he was disdainful of his success in musical theater despite revolutionizing it with ""West Side Story."" But then why did he spend so much time working in it if he hated it? Why weren't we at least treated with someone doing a cameo appearance as Stephen Sondheim? Why why why?And then to top it all off, the last quarter of the film is a dreary slog as we watch Mulligan slowly die of cancer. I despise it when movies show characters slowly dying of cancer. It freaks me out, and I hate it. I know this woman actually did die of cancer, but I don't want to watch it. That's more my problem than it is the movie's, because that's what happened, but still.Cooper's screenplay is terrible, and because of that, nothing else about the movie has a chance. Mulligan is quite good, but she's hampered by the material. Cooper will be nominated for an Oscar, and might win, because the Academy loves nothing more than rewarding actors for playing famous people while heaped under prosthetic makeup. To the film's credit, for once the makeup is quite good. Usually biopic makeup makes the actors look like their faces are about to melt off, but here the effect is pretty seamless.Someone clearly told Bradley Cooper that Warren Beatty is the only person to ever score Oscar nominations for producing, directing, writing, and acting in the same film, and Cooper said ""Hold my beer."" He's so desperately hankering for an Oscar for this film that you can smell red carpet wafting from the screen.Grade: C-~evanston_dad rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Mesmirising portrait, but not in the way I had expected...: Beware, this is a movie about Bernstein's marriage, NOT about his music. It should have better been titled as ""The Marriage of Leonard & Felicia"" and not ""Maestro"".I expected a music biopic, but what I got was a masterfully directed and terrifically acted portrait of a marriage with a bisexual husband and all the difficulties (secret affairs with gay men) that came along with it, when back in the days of the fifties and sixties, being gay wasnt something one could openly talk about in public.The good: LONG scenes with NO editing cuts. What BLISS to be able to watch these 2 great actors perform uninhibited by cuts, with many minutes long lasting scenes filmed from 1 static angle. I truly applaud the director (Bradley Cooper) and the photographer and editor for this gorgeous and balanced way of filming this portrait. I was really impressed!Any bad? I had my trepidations about Bradley Cooper's impersonation of Bernstein that was borderline according to many. Did he pull it off? I think he did a really good job, although it took me some time to get used to all the mannerisims (the peculiar voice in particular). I can understand though that others might get a bit uneasy / irritated by some of the makeup (too much?) and other mannerisims.Carey Mulligan (as the wife of Bernstein) deserves special mention. Her role was more subdued and subtle, but AS powerful and touching. She truly shined!Conclusion: I am not a fan of watching stories about artist's private lives, but as far as this personal account of Leonard Bernstein's marriage is concerned, they created a really mesmirising, warmhearted portrait, that left me behind in my seat with goosebumps and in reverence...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb!~imseeg rated 8/10 on 26 November 2023"," Admired it more than I liked it: POSITIVES:1) The two central performances are both absolutely sensational. Both Cooper and Mulligan have some really jaw dropping scenes and they were what kept me engaged throughout2) The direction and cinematography are both superb. There are lots of long takes and clever camerawork and this helped to make certain scenes feel much more impactful, such as the big conducting scene near the end that goes on for several minutes with only a couple of cuts3) Using Bernstein's own pieces as the score for the film was very clever and I loved how over dramatic the score felt a lot of the timeNEGATIVES:1) I really didn't like the first hour or so of this film while it was in black and white. It just felt so pretentious, fake and full of itself. Also, the characters all talk insanely fast for some reason during the black and white scenes. Things did improve once things went to colour though2) As the title of this review states, I felt like the film was more of a technical achievement than something I actually enjoyed watching. I didn't really care about any of the characters, in fact I found Bernstein very unlikeable, and I wasn't really invested in the plot3) As is the case with a lot of biopics, I think this film is guilty of trying to cram an entire person's life into only 2 hours, which makes a lot of things feel very rushed.~DanLawson146 rated 7/10 on 7 December 2023"," Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance: It's a biopic set in New York City between 1943 and the late 1980s. Its primary focus is the relationship and marriage between Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). We learn pretty early that Bernstein's sexual appetites extend to both women and men. An early male relationship is with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). Felicia knows Bernstein's orientation from the beginning but asks that he be discrete. We also meet Bernstein's sister, Shirley (Sarah Silverman), and, especially, he and Felicia's oldest daughter, Jamie (Maya Hawke).The second orientation of ""Maestro"" is Bernstein's difficulty harnessing his expansive skills in composition, conducting, and popular education about music. His extroversion sometimes hinders his ability to focus. The film portrays this issue less effectively.""Maestro"" is an intense and skillfully photographed movie. The cinematography reflects the era being portrayed. Thus, for example, the film is black and white until the 1960s. I cannot comment on the portrayals of Bernstein's conducting or the quality of his compositions, except to note that Bernstein's conducting is very intense. An enormous number of people populate the film, making it difficult to keep track from time to time. That said, Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance that deserves Academy consideration, though some parts of her life are missing, such as her political activism.Cooper's Bernstein is not deep outside the relationship with Felicia that slowly deteriorates. The film omits to mention that Bernstein also had affairs with women during the marriage. The movie portrays Felicia's final illness with breast cancer very effectively and emotionally..~steiner-sam rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," I've watched too many of this kind of story, and 'Maestro' isn't an inch different.: A struggling musician agonized by his own genius, talents, and creativity and trapped in loveless marriage filled with guilt. Both look the other way while one has an affair and realize the importance of one's own partner too late. Right now, at the top of my head I can think of 'Fosse/Verdon', 'A Star Is Born', 'George & Tammy', 'Walk the Line', 'Dreamgirls', 'Daisy Jones & The Six', and etc. (Wow, that's a lot.) Biographical genre is especially tricky because it has to excel the life of actual historical figures. 'Maestro' could have been so much better if it delved into the introspective and artistic side of Bernstein deeper or provided a different and fresh point of view on his life rather than reciting his personal life. His autobiography or research would be more fun and interesting than this explanatory movie.There were a few futile attempts to make the movie look more artistic, abstract, and ambiguous. They failed because they serve no purpose but to look pretentious. White and black, camera movement, the use of light and shadows, and musical aspects. They are all good attempts, but for what? By doing so, is the story getting stronger? Do they enhance what viewers feel? Waste of time and films.Bradley Cooper's performance is disappointing. He never acts; he imitates. When he's on the screen, we know clearly that he's acting. It's hard to be absorbed and immersed into the screen because he always pushes the audience away with his trying too hard. I get that he wants to emulate Bernstein's twangy voice. However, emotions and messages he delivers are more important than his likeness of Bernstein's tone, accent, sound, or mannerism. He focuses on what's outside of Bernstein rather than what would be inside of him. There is a 10 minute sequence of Cooper conducting, and it's screaming 'Look how good I am!!!'. It's one of the highest points for emotions to burst out for the audience, and I started to laugh.~TaylorYee94 rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," The filmmaking was very good, but I found the story not that interesting.: We don't know much about Leonard Bernstein. We didn't learn why he wanted to be a composer or how he got in the business. His relationship wasn't very clear either. He's bisexual, but that doesn't go anywhere. His wife isn't explained much either other than being a stage actress. We don't know much about his children. The timelines aren't clear when the movie takes place. It seems to start in the 50s other than the opening scene of him as an old man. I do like Bradley Cooper's performance, but not much comes from the character. We don't know what made him famous since he was already famous before his memorable score in On the Waterfront.~MJB784 rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," Where's the biography?: Yes, good acting, great music but absolutely no story. At all. Apart from his bisexuality which dominated the script.Bradley Cooper was too greedy in writing, directing and starring. What did he write? Not much of a story. I'd like to have seen Lenny's childhood explicated, more meat on the bare bones offered here.Also, why so little on West Side Story - one brief extract and not the huge explosive hit it was at the time. The adulation which followed.The teasing bits of his Missa were beautiful and far too much of his Mahler, though lovely, had little bearing on the overall story.Brad's prosthetic nose was distracting in that it gave a nasal whiny tone to his dialogue. And he might have done better with another actor.Carey Mulligan, as always was amazing in her role but again, underplayed the distress she must have felt at his infidelity/. At one point he left her for a young (male) lover and only returned when she was diagnosed with cancer. (in her breast, from a broken heart? Who knows)The great man of music was not served well here, far too shallow a treatment of his genius.5/10.~wisewebwoman rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," How is it possbile to make Leonard Bernstein uninteresting?: The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper's transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn't a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife's dealing with her husband's bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein's conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn't much left!~fmdead rated 6/10 on 24 December 2023", Too much about his marriage: Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception. Bradley should just have acted and not tried to direct and write the screenplay.~phd_travel rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023
Oppenheimer (2023) - IMDb,8.4,Cillian Murphy|Emily Blunt|Matt Damon|Robert Downey Jr.|Alden Ehrenreich|Scott Grimes|Jason Clarke|Kurt Koehler|Tony Goldwyn|John Gowans|Macon Blair|James D'Arcy|Kenneth Branagh|Harry Groener|Gregory Jbara|Ted King|Tim DeKay|Steven Houska,Christopher Nolan,Christopher Nolan|Kai Bird|Martin Sherwin,The story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.," A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.: One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 8/10 on 20 July 2023"," Murphy is exceptional: You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.~Orlando_Gardner rated 9/10 on 19 July 2023"," Quality but exhausting: I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.~Bonobo13579 rated 7/10 on 21 July 2023"," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws: ""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.~MrDHWong rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!: This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!~and_mikkelsen rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short: I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.~Geekofriendly rated 8/10 on 26 July 2023"," A Masterpiece: I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history.

NOW.~mohameddawoud-26019 rated 10/10 on 19 July 2023"," And the Oscar goes to...: I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.~mark-217-307033 rated 10/10 on 19 July 2023"," Is it just me ?: Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.~pdean-49132 rated 8/10 on 21 July 2023"," Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way: Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.~timmyhollywood rated 6/10 on 23 July 2023"

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.~MrDHWong rated 9/10 on 19 October 2023"," Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...: The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !~imseeg rated 5/10 on 21 October 2023"," Could have been told in 2 hours: Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)While watching the Irishman, I remember feeling guilty about pausing to check how much time was left. This time, I was scared to look at the watch because I never leave the cinema without finishing a. Movie. I know it's Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors who made phenomenal movies like Taxi Driver, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed, but honestly, Scorsese shmorsese for making this one 2 hours longer than it had to be.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves. It's a nice story that could have been an 8/10 as it explores the topics of greed, colonisation and cultural erasure without any consequences. It also came out at a perfect time considering the current events, but did it have to be sooooo damn loooong?Knowing the title of the film, you automatically know it's ending so that alone saps out all the mystery. For what is supposed to be a sad story, the film doesn't create any emotional weight to make us care for it's characters and as a result, it's hard to connect with anything. De Niro and Fraser did a fine job but DiCaprio looked like a pitiful aging boar instead of the young, sly and seductive fox he was meant to be.The costumes and decorations were great but it's like they forgot about the audience while making this film. The story repeats the same trope again and again creating zero tension for us to be invested in until the final 30 minutes. Moreover, it's as if the whole cast, was injected with ketamine as they looked and sounded lethargic adding more weight to the dragging pace.If Scorsese wanted to make an impact then he should've used emotions and tension instead of 600 pauses, glances and empty conversations. He was trying to say a lot in the epilogue about tragedy being hidden behind entertainment and profit but by the time the epilogue finally came, I was happy to go home instead of being floored by the sadness. It's an important story that sadly didn't work out as an impactful drama.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.~arabnikita rated 4/10 on 21 October 2023"," Killers Of The Audience's Bladders: Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.~boblipton rated 7/10 on 22 October 2023"," Extremely Long & Incredibly Morose: Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 5/10 on 18 November 2023"," Killers of my patience: Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.~Med-Jasta rated 4/10 on 22 October 2023"," Coyote want money: Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 9/10 on 18 October 2023"," Somewhere in the middle for me: I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.~petervd rated 7/10 on 29 October 2023"," Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese: Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.~fredrikgunerius rated 4/10 on 15 November 2023"," Not the masterpiece that was hyped: Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.~Truedutch rated 7/10 on 19 October 2023"
Ferrari (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Adam Driver|Shailene Woodley|Giuseppe Festinese|Alessandro Cremona|Derek Hill|Leonardo Caimi|Penélope Cruz|Gabriel Leone|Michele Savoia|Jacopo Bruno|Domenico Fortunato|Damiano Neviani|Giuseppe Bonifati|Franca Abategiovanni|Marino Franchitti|Valentina Bellè|Luciano Miele|Daniela Piperno,Michael Mann,Troy Kennedy Martin|Brock Yates,"Set in the summer of 1957, with Enzo Ferrari's auto empire in crisis, the ex-racer turned entrepreneur pushes himself and his drivers to the edge as they launch into the Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy."," Nice to have Michael Mann back: Ferrari chooses a very interesting and kinda unconventional part of the true story to adapt. Instead of going for a conventional underdog story it's a much more intense, more interesting film that shows how masculinity and ambition desensitise someone to the tragedy that surrounds them.Adam Driver delivers a performance that may not be in the upper tier of his work but this is still terrific stuff, and the accent is better here than in House of Gucci. His inability to process his own grief hangs over the whole film, the fact that he couldn't fix it clearly eats at him all the time and the one outburst it builds to is glorious.Penélope Cruz is given a role that is usually pretty thankless in this genre and does so much. She is terrifying without saying a word and holds a lot of power. Shailene Woodley on the other hand, isn't given much to do and her accent isn't consistent and yet she's still good enough to prevent that from being a major distraction.Michael Mann's direction gets just as close to the racing as it does to Adam Driver's stern face. The racing sequences themselves are electric, by getting as close as possible, the speed and danger are definitely felt. It all culminates in a horrifying crash in which the lack of sound makes it even more impactful.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Could have been a lot better: For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough.~ethanbresnett rated 6/10 on 23 December 2023"," Everyone Versus Ferrari: It's 1957 and Enzo Ferrari, as portrayed by Adam Driver, has a lot on his mind. His wife (Penelope Cruz) is mad with grief over the death of their son; his mistress, Shailene Woodley, wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed; he's hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed, and he's distracted by his movie-star girlfriend; and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner, which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousand-mile Mille Miglia. Also, Orsi over at Maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racers.Michael Mann is not known for character studies. His subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side, so this movie about Ferrari is a natural fit. The script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are, and they keep increasing throughout the movie, while Adam Driver lets down his guard with no one one, and Miss Cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks. I am not fond of movies about racing, since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroom-vroom sounds from their audio libraries. However, this movie makes clear that Ferrari's one real passion is racing cars, and it's a series of real crises that he has to overcome. Considering the negligible story content of so many of this year's ""For your consideration"" titles, I'll say that it's easily worth your time in the theater seat.~boblipton rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," Nice mixture of car racing and family drama can entertain assortment of viewers. Beforehand I was afraid that car racing would use up most running time, but I stand corrected: Saw this at the 2023 filmfestival Ghant (Belgium). Obviously, the main topic is cars and car races, but there is also a mixture of family drama (illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir, woman with money prepared to invest, and so on) to make it compatible for family viewing. Actually, you can consider it two films, nicely intermixed with another. The car race fans will find plenty to watch, and the rest of the film moves the family story forward. Implicitly we know that the story ends well; this is no spoiler, given that the name Ferrari still exists as a car brand.Nice details in abundance. Drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate. When drivers bring their girlfriends along, the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women, to the dismay of Ferrari. He asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world, letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it, playing the cards for a business deal. And there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare, who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the company.All in all, I did not regret booking tickets, although I feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu. My fears were unjustified. There is ample family and relational drama to keep everyone's attention, and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience.~JvH48 rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Ironically Slow Given The Subject Matter: Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.~cdjh-81125 rated 5/10 on 18 December 2023", Stylish biopic with strong characters and great performances: Watched Ferrari on the closing night of NYFF 61. Great to see the return of Michael Mann after 8 years.Tells the story of Enzo Ferrari and the world of Italian fast car racing both from a personal and professional angle. The glamour of fast cars and their fearless drivers juxtaposed against the mortal risk they take as they try to excel in their field.The personal life to Enzo trying to balance his powerful and strong wife Laura played by Penelope and his love and mother of his surviving son Lina played by Shailene is a treat to watch. Strong performances from all the 3 leads and a special callout for Penelope for her portrayal of Laura.~rakeshroy31 rated 9/10 on 15 October 2023," I Was Expecting More...: Have only seen this advertised a couple of times but was sort of intrigued as to what sort of film it would be. The trailers didn't exactly sell it to me & didn't exactly excite me in any way. But as I said, I was intrigued & of course was able to see this ahead of the UK Boxing Day release via a Limitless Membership.Set in the summer of 1957, with Enzo Ferrari's auto empire in crisis, the ex-racer turned entrepreneur pushes himself & his drivers to the edge as they launch into the Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy.I found the film to be quite mundane for the most part. The story & sub plots were confusing & the film was hard to follow. The racing & crashes were good, & with a bit of eye candy, it just about got you through the overly long 2 hours & 7 minute runtime.The casting is not bad, but could've been better & like the film, could've used some meaty impact. The film looks & feels tired as it plods along & of course, you find yourself not caring & your mind wandering. The pacing is also off in this flick too.I was more expecting the film to be about the orgins of Enzo's life, like how he worked his way up sort of thing & most importantly, to be easier to follow & be more concise in its story-telling, which this film failed on all forms.Overall, don't expect much from this flick. The film really is as mundane as the trailer is & if that doesn't make you think twice, I don't know what will. This film is ok, but could've been better, much, much better.5/10.~vengeance20 rated 5/10 on 19 December 2023"," 7 1/2 stars, really... Penelope Cruz was amazing!: Saw this at the Viennale in Vienna today.Penelope Cruz is a gem as Laura. Woodley somehow plays the same character in everything she's cast in. I think she's got talent, but how can you tell at this point? Driver was okay. The bad accents by the American actors took a while getting used to, but at 135min, there is plenty time for that.The real stars were the cars and the driving scenes of course - and they were absolutely stunning!I'm not a big action movie person, but these scenes were so well done, I'd get into the Fast & Furious franchise if it was done by this crew.As far as the story goes: it's well done, there is enough meat there in Enzo's personal life and the goings-on around the infamous '57 Mille Miglia that audiences who aren't only going for the car race will be satisfied.But Penelope Cruz carries the non-car-stuff on her shoulders, really. She's a powerhouse actress and for some reason I seem to forget it time and time again until I see another movie with her in it and am surprised at how good she is. I shouldn't be surprised - nobody should be. She's always great... but here, she's at the top of her game.~Cacahuate86 rated 8/10 on 24 October 2023"," A most welcome return for a brilliant director: When I heard this was coming out I was very excited, not so much because I'm a fan of this or any other brand of car but simply because it has been so long since my man Mann had helmed a theatrical release. That being said, I'll admit that going in and coming out of this, I retain my positive bias for the director. And with THAT being said, I'll point out what I didn't like first, just to be fair.The pacing of Ferrari felt off and made it feel longer than its running time as the film stumbled around its themes, almost afraid to commit to any one of them. To me, this was a fairly mundane procedural biopic that flashed moments of potential through some very clever dialogue, performed to near perfection by its leads. What other critics have written rang true initially- I didn't walk out feeling like I actually had enough of a glimpse inside the head of the man behind the brand and what made him tick and if I had just left it at that I'd have given the movie a lower rating.However...I starting asking myself, ""how much more of a glimpse would I need that would justify this character's actions and decisions any more than was already depicted?"" And the answer I came to was that I actually did understand why he acted and reacted to everything that occurred in the story. If I wasn't careful, I could have easily fallen into that ""unimpressed"" spiral where no amount of psychoanalysis was enough, thus hamstringing my enjoyment of what is actually a really good movie. We will never fully know anybody, no matter how much we learn about them, and armed with that notion, I realized Enzo's character study held a mystique akin to Mann's brilliant depiction of Ali.Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz were seminal and both deserve Oscar nods, whatever that's worth these days (I'm still confused and have thoughts on why Will Smith lost out to Denzel for best actor way back when). The camera work and cinematography was true-to-form perfect, the drama was affecting and THAT crash scene was the first time I'd gasped in a theatre since I don't know when.In my humble opinion, Ferrari is a triumphant return for a prodigal auteur and I really hope it spells the beginning of more releases from one of my very favourite directors.Ps: so many critics have accused Mann for his general inability to harness drama in his films that I wonder if they have ever seen The Insider.~tpetroi rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Tedious, just so boring: 2 hours I'll never get back, I think the challenge is to see if you can stay awake for the whole film!The trailer did a good job at fooling you into thinking would be interestingAdam Driver was far too wooden and you never really felt any empathy with the character and just grew to dislike him more & more as you got to know more about him, as an advertising platform for Ferrari it failed although that wasn't its remit.Comparing this to Ford v Ferrari which had a much better script and was enjoyable to watch , this just plodded along and never really started , there was no excitement & no emotionMichael Mann had directed some great films like Heat & Collateral but this is probably his worst piece of work to date.~Padreviews rated 4/10 on 18 December 2023"

Next to me a grown man sobbed the entire way through. I heard sniffles throughout the entire theater. I had to put my popcorn on the ground because it felt inappropriate to eat popcorn while watching this movie. I even felt wrong laying down in my recliner chair, so I moved it in an upright position. This movie holds a great deal of gravity. It's heaviness is devastating, and if you let it, it could flip your world upside down. The whole point of the film is to flip your world, because unfortunately we merely go about life as if these atrocities aren't happening. This movie will try and wake you up to the sick reality of child trafficking. I reckon it will be successful. It's incredibly well done, has a fantastic compelling script, for having little budget on the actor scene, I'd say it's performances were beyond excellent. Even had some real artistically beautiful shots.Great film with an incredibly powerful message.See this movie. Have your friends and family see this movie. Share it with all.

It wasn't graphic, but to see, to an extent, what Tim Ballard saw, really hits right in the heart. The children in the movie were phenomenal actors is helping to understand the innocence and fear that one would go through in being in that situation.My heart went out to each one of them, yet still hurts knowing that they are just actors and there are actual children being sold everyday.There is a great understanding of what Tim Ballard went through to save the children he did. The sacrifice. The pain, and the darkness that lies within the hearts of people that would take children and destroy their souls and lives.I give this movie a high rating because it wasn't just a good movie, it was a wake up call to all people that there are atrocities occurring everyday towards children and it needs to stop. I appreciate everything this movie sets out to accomplish and it was so well done. It wasn't graphic, but it told the story that needed to be told the way it needed to be told.~3DForMe rated 10/10 on 5 July 2023"," Powerful: Powerful story about an impossibly difficult topic.

Was I uncomfortable during parts of the movie? I was, and everyone should be!! There is nothing graphic, but you understand what's happening. We need to be more aware of these things and be watchful and alert with our own children and all children!! For this reason I recommend that you see this movie. It will help us all to be more vigilant.

It was a deeply powerful movie, but the subject matter is so disturbing that it's difficult to bear it.Sound of Freedom is an expertly shot, gripping, and powerful movie. At the end, I wanted to cry and vomit, yet those are not criticisms of the movie, it's the realization that this sickness actually happens every day all over the world. This movie is The Road + Taken, and amped up 500 times.Jim Cavezel gives an incredible performance. The directing, pacing, and cinematography are perfect.

Whether you have kids or not, makes no difference this movie is for everyone. If you have children, I suggest you have them watch with you because everybody needs to wake up to what is going on in this world! AN's children need to be very aware of their surrounding. I know it's scary, but better safe than sorry IMO. Im sad to know that in our country, of these United States, we are some of the worlds worst! Although this movie is absolutely heartbreaking, it also gives you a little bit of hope. Because we know God is with us, but also we know there are some really good people out there trying to make a change. Putting their lives on the line, putting their families in danger whether it be because their mom or dad is not coming home because they lay their life on the line to save somebody else's child, or they're made as cops/informants and families are killed. They are all heroes! I wondered as I was sitting in the theater watching this movie...in the two hours I was there I wondered how many children were trafficked or how many were sexually abused. It is absolutely heartbreaking and it is very real.~cscott2331 rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"," Do You Hear That?: ""Sound of Freedom"" is based on the true story of Tim Ballard as he tries to rescue abducted children from sex traffickers. The movie was produced by ""Angel Studios"", and actually was made back in 2018 but faced a number of delays and finally saw the light of day in 2023.It is important to be able to separate the theme of a movie, with the quality of the movie. I am 100% in agreement with the movie's message. Child slavery is an awful thing and this great evil should be stamped out. But that isn't the question, the question is: How is the movie? It is pretty good.It is a very tightly edited, there is not a wasted minute of screen time. It is very well acted, from Cavizel to the children, there was not a performance in the film that I didn't believe. The music was also good, it set up the suspense and enhanced the action.Don't be fooled by the marketing and genre, I wouldn't really consider this film an ""action movie"". It is much more a drama. They do a good job with suspense, but for the most part it is more focused on the depth of the situation. When they do action, it isn't all that well edited. But I do understand, that is not the focus of the film.The movie also loses me as it approaches its final act. Most of the film felt grounded and real, it is based on a true story after all. But then the movie adds a bonus scene, that feels like it is from a different film. It may have happened in real life, I am just saying in the film, it felt out of place.Overall, it is a really good film. I am glad it is doing well. I like seeing some lower budget films get a chance to shine, and I do think it has an important message to share. Let freedom ring.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 9 August 2023"," Go see it!: I was able to watch a screening of this film and WOW! It was powerful, eye-opening, heart-wrenching yet hopeful.

Jim is freaking amazing at what he does. He really made me feel the emotional torment that his character struggled through. I was anticipating a slower moving film but it was fast-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat. It kept me begging to please allow for a satisfactory ending. I wanted to see everyone get what they deserved. Unfortunately, this is real life and not everything has a happy ending.

At first thought, I didn't think I wanted to watch a movie about child trafficking. I felt like they would have made it graphic and evil. But this movie didn't do that. Instead of making you feel disgusting inside about the awfulness of child trafficking, it instead made you hopeful that something can be done about it.The overall cinematography, storytelling, and interesting music made this film a perfect set-up for a powerful message. I only took off the one star because I think some of the acting could have been slightly improved, but the film still got it's point across: God's children are not for sale!~calebtshelton rated 9/10 on 24 May 2023"," Don't be afraid to see this.: I was worried there might be things in this movie that would cause trauma. There are no explicit scenes. That being said, this is an important movie and every parent should see it. Not only that, I would recommend it for teens as well. The acting, the script and the whole presentation is first rate. I think about this story, and it is true, and it cuts deep. It also keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Sometimes movies with a message can be either over the top or boring. This was neither. You could hear a pin drop in the theater through most of the film. I hope you will give this movie a chance. You won't regret it and it may open your awareness in a way that could save a child's life (Maybe even your own).~ErinsGloma rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"
Napoleon (2023) - IMDb,6.6,Joaquin Phoenix|Vanessa Kirby|Tahar Rahim|Rupert Everett|Mark Bonnar|Paul Rhys|Ben Miles|Riana Duce|Ludivine Sagnier|Edouard Philipponnat|Miles Jupp|Scott Handy|Youssef Kerkour|John Hollingworth|Abubakar Salim|Thom Ashley|Jannis Niewöhner|Julian Rhind-Tutt,Ridley Scott,David Scarpa,"An epic that details the checkered rise and fall of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his wife, Josephine."," A few words of warning for those with high expectations...: A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 23 November 2023"," An interesting failure: Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.~petra_ste rated 6/10 on 3 December 2023"," My biggest disappointment this year: Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.~MissSimonetta rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep: Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better.~Vic_max rated 6/10 on 22 November 2023"," Knew it was Bad. Even so, Surprised at HOW bad.: I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.~levybob rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Awful.: What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.~krzysiektom rated 2/10 on 26 November 2023"," Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies: Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up.~epicking rated 3/10 on 23 November 2023"," BAD, REALLY BAD, TERRIBLY BAD, AND I WILL EXPLAIN: First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.: Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.~dhunjiwadia rated 5/10 on 26 November 2023"," Bring on the director's cut!: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.~zeki-4 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"

Great work.... everyone.~LordCommandar rated 8/10 on 28 December 2023"," Very Good Movie: Rating: 8.7Overall, a very polished period drama that is executed well on many fronts as the direction, cinematography, and performances from Mads Mikkelsen and Amanda Collin help create a very captivating movie, but the writing and story construction hold it back from being something great.Very Good Direction (Does a great job on a macro-scale as some of the scenes look stunning as he effectively uses cinematography and editing to capture their grand nature (like in the palaces and especially in the farming scenes; does a very good job on a micro-scale as he develops sequences very well; gets a lot out of his actors as they all work well with Mikkelson to drive the story forward; the biggest drawback is the storytelling as it is kinda predictable with what is going to happy next (especially with the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist as its pretty generic and cliche with how its told), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Mads Mikkelsen (Has somewhat of a grit to this performance that helps show who his character is; he controls every scene he is in and really lifts the performances around him as he acts as someone to work off of; shows his experience and why he is one of the most renowned Danish actors in cinema history), Very Good from Amanda Collin (Very Good female lead to Mikkelsen as the two have great chemistry, but she also has moments where she shines on her own (especially in the climax); really embodies someone who is of the working class and looking for revenge), Good from Simon Bennebjerg (Plays the pompous prick role well as he does his best effort to make sure everyone hates him (though this makes his performance a bit one-sided as he is written pretty shallowly), Good from the rest of the cast (does their job helping move the story forward and working with Mikkelsen to make the scenes more interesting)), Pretty Good to Good Story (The concept uses a baseline source material that is very interesting and draws your attention because its based on a true story; The story construction is kinda an issue because the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist is pretty shallow since it just follows many cliches about the power trip of royalty, and this affects the plot as it has to construct itself around this major conflict (although the overarching storyline between the protagonist and the king and the protagonist developing relationships with the female lead and child are written well); the flow of sequences is fine and does a good job in making the story interesting; the character writing for the protagonist, the female lead, and child are good as their grit present them as more well-rounded characters trying to achieve something, but the writing for the other characters (especially the antagonist) is very shallow that you do not really care for them towards the end of the movie), Good Screenplay (The dialogue is well written and comes off very polished (staying true to 1700s vernacular); the humor is used decently well to lift the tension in some of the traumatic scenes (especially with the antagonist to show how twisted he is); the use of symbolism is decently present, but the message just feels like it isn't clearly conveyed with the direction they chose in the end; the foreshadowing is pretty good)), Very Good Score (Felt really similar to Joker and used well to set the tone), Great Cinematography (Really polished and helps show the vastness of the world and the emotions of the characters), Very Good Sound (Felt very crisp and helped with building tension), Very Good Editing (Used well in conjunction with the Cinematography to deliver a polished product), Very Good Visual Effects (The use of practical effects makes the move stunning (especially the use of fire and blood)), Great Production Design (Helps with setting the time period as they build these grand palace sets as a dichotomy to the rural landscapes to show the separation of the classes), Very Good Costumes (Helps with setting the time period and showing the juxtaposition between the upper and lower classes), Plot Structure was fine for the most part as all the overarching plot elements were there and built on each other in a standard fashion; the main issue is the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is just a bit too cliche and forced that it has a major impact on how the rising action develops (but it does help with the climax though); the exposition just drags a lot and is very unnecessary/forced (could have been removed and the movie would have been the same), Pacing was a bit on the slower side as it followed the pace of other period dramas (but it does move faster than most movies in its genre), Climax was very good itself and executed well (especially with Collin's performance); the exposition just really dampers this climax as it ruins the momentum built up by a well-executed sequence, Tone was very similar to other period dramas (does not provide anything new on this front), Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest.~cinemapersonified rated 8/10 on 5 November 2023"," Brilliant, Moving, Emotional: I watched this movie at the Busan International Film Festival this week. I went into it, without much information and didn't know what to expect. And oh wow, it blew me away. I straight away put it on my ""Top 10 Favourite Movies of all Time"" list.First of all Mads Mikkelsen is a phenomenal actor and the perfect choice to play Ludvig Kahlen. He shines especially in the scenes, where he ""only"" acts out pure emotion with his facial expressions without having to say a word. There is one scene at the very end, where he sits all alone in his farm house, eating at a table and the camera zooms into a close up shot onto his face. It is a captivating scene, were no words are spoken but so much was said. He is a superb actor.Throughout the movie you feel all kinds of emotions yourself: anger, hatred, sadness, frustration, disgust, joy, relief,.. I felt it all. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions.I felt strong hatred for the villain of the story played by Simon Bennebjerg, who was also a perfect cast for this. You really start to hate his character pretty early on, his arrogance, greed and disrespect for all people around him, make him a despicable character.After watching the movie, my friend and I had a long discussion about human greed and what our motivation in life is. Is it worth to betray, let down and/or loose loved ones over a title, money and/or fame?10 out of 10, worth every second.~katcarajenncy rated 10/10 on 11 October 2023"," A beautiful and well balanced story with great acting: This was a surprisingly good movie. I've been disappointed by quite a few period drama pieces from the last years, so my expectations going in were not very high, especially given the description of it being ""Western set in 18th century Denmark"". But going out of the theatre I had to admit that I had a near perfect cinema experience. The movie was beautifully filmed with nearly each frame being a work of art. The acting was superb and the characters were interesting and well-developed. Mads Mikkelsen was stellar in his role, and I loved Ann Barbara, Anmai Mus and the priest. Simon Bennebjerg was great as the unhinged, but charismatic Frederik de Schinkel. The plot wasn't particularly original, but it kept you invested in the story, and was logical and well-rounded and the ending left no loose threads. The love story was compelling without being overly dramatic - because most love stories aren't! Another reviewer commented that it felt unnatural to him but to me on contrary it felt very realistic that these characters would seek out each other's warmth and comfort in the circumstances they were placed in. Other parts were well-balanced too - it had just enough blood and fighting and torture scenes to get the story across, but none just for drama's sake. The movie borrowed a lot of elements from the Western genre, but it felt authentic and in no way like a Hollywood clone. All in all, it was fantastic, well rounded film and a great cinematic experience.~formenteralady rated 10/10 on 20 October 2023"," Everything I hoped for and more!: I've been waiting on this film since it was under preproduction and it was worth the wait. The acting from everyone was fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen went deep into his character and it really showcased his acting skills. He was amazing.It was witty, brutal, beautiful, funny (I give credit to Anders Thomas Jensen for that) and nail biting. It had a great flow to it.Nicolaj Arcel filmed this one and he also did ""A Royal Affair"", but I really can't compare the two of them. Two completely different stories. ""A Royal Affair"" had more of romance story attached to it, but this goes a bit deeper and darker.Please do yourselves a favor and see this in the theater if you get a chance. You won't regret it!~swedal-85459 rated 10/10 on 24 October 2023"," finally a movie that you can feel!: I love Mads' work, ever since i first saw him in a 007 movie, and he always delivers. I'm no movie critic, just a guy that loves to watch a good flick, but Mads always delivers intense performance, no matter be it a comedy or drama. Every character in this movie, as soon as they are introduced on the screen, shows layers and layers of their persona and its just incredible how they do it. Acting, by all of the actors, was absolutely superb! Within first few sentences of a character, you feel like you know their past, what drives them, why are they the way they are etc...just incredible. The whole movie is heavy with emotion you can cut with a knife, and I felt sucked into the story from minute 1. Thats what we need in a movie, engrossing entertainment, great acting and great stories, not agenda pushing. No sub-story here, just good 'ol acting and entertainment.~tohmsono rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," yet another...: Excellent scandinavian historical drama, moulded in the good hands of danish filmakers this time, on the moors and marshland of jutlandia, said to be barren and harsh dirt where no plants of edible kind would grow.Mads mikkelsen , is the captain of this vessel called ''b......n'' in danish and ''promised land'' in english, not to well translated as a b.....d is a b.....d both in danish and english language, and the word should be allowed used in the reviews on IMDB as long as the danish title says so....Its a story taking place in the 1700's, about the pioneers of danish agricultural development, using the newly introduced potatoe to the danish society. Its the battle between the layman and the lords, the peasants and the landowners, and a mighty king on top of the pyramide, that encourage development...a very well handcrafted film, that reach far beyond todays national borderlines, an icecold glance that will grip yor mind and heart for its lavishness and upper class injustice to maintain their grip on society. Its costumes and style of the era has been very well taken care of, also the etched through hate towards the travellers and other ''outcasts'' of society in this era.Its a long playtime, but i cant see where to cut it down at length, therefore bare over with that, and turn your zeitgeist back to the 1750's, its a recommend from the grumpy old man.~ops-52535 rated 9/10 on 25 December 2023"," Mads Mikkelsen is rarely in bad movies: ""The Promised Land"" (Bastarden in Danish), based on a book by Ida Jessen called ""The Captain and Ann Barbara"" which in turn, based on a real life person is about a captain (Mads Mikkelsen) who sets out to conquer the Heath in Jutland which is said to be impossible to grow anything in. Throughout, he meets a lot of resistance working towards his goal.I like Mads Mikkelsen as an actor, let me just get that straight out of the way. This guy rarely RARELY makes bad movies. He's just too good and underrated. The movie itself was pretty good too. I found myself pretty invested in the plot and the different characters. Mads Mikkelsen was brilliant in the role of Ludvig Kahlen and Amanda Collin was amazing as Ann Barbara the housekeeper. And not to talk about how good Simon Bennebjerg was as the villain, Frederik de Schinkel (also based on a real person). The film was emotional at times too.Here's my only strife with the movie and literally my only strife... Although both Mads Mikkelsen and Frederik de Schinkel existed back in the 1700's which the movie took place, in real life they had absolutely nothing to do with each other. At least from the little i've read online. I found it weird they decided to mix them together in this.~darapjohnson rated 7/10 on 28 December 2023"," Good Period Drama from Nikolaj Arcel: Danish cinema has made some impressive films in the past and while, The Promised Land is no where my favorite Danish movie, it certainly is one of the most gorgeous looking one I have seen in awhile.Filmmaker Nikolaj Arcel created A Royal Affair which I thought was pretty good. Unfortunately his work a The Dark Tower was pretty awful but luckily, this new movie is big improvement as it showcases Arcel's talents on the direction, narrative and the characters. Throughout, the camerawork is gorgeous and many of the costumes, sound designs and the effects are well-done as it helped captured the time era and the setting. Many of the themes of fight aganist greed, cruelty, land ownership, landscapes, people, and other themes on the western genre are well explored. All of the performances are pretty great as Mads Mikkelsen and Amanda Collin provided the best performance throughout.The narrative is pretty interesting, although a few writing concepts that felt a bit predictable. I personally enjoyed the characters but I felt some of the other characters could have been explored a little more on certain levels of development. The soundtrack is great, the dialogue is well-written and the pacing, while a few slow moments, is pretty good as I didn't feel bored throughout observing the movie.Overall, It's a good film from Denmark and it's great to see Arcel getting a new chance with a better film.~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"

Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the Höss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the Hösses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf Höss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. Hüller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends.~ergo-58534 rated 10/10 on 12 July 2023"," Life near Auschwitz, told in hushed tones: This incandescent film portrays the idyllic life that the family of Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss enjoyed in a sumptuous house right next to the concentration camp in Auschwitz right in the middle of the Holocaust. There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout.We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination.A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire. But overall, this is an extraordinary and memorable film from start to finish. Recommended to everyone, without exception.~PotassiumMan rated 9/10 on 17 December 2023"," Subtlety at its Finest: An absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that challenges and provokes the audience, while also depicting a morbid yet enticingly original perspective on the most infamous and horrific tragedy of all time. Johnathon Glazer's Zone of Interest is not a film to merely watch, but rather one to be absorbed. A paradoxical film, where the most important and powerful images are the ones we never get to see.The concept of the withholding of art being the overarching meaning behind the work certainly isn't reinventing the wheel, but Glazer's presentation and execution puts a spin on the concept in such a unique and cryptic way, it will have you asking yourself if such an idea can ever be done in cinema again.The ""withholding"" begins with the opening of the film. Before the title is flashed onto screen, the audience is treated to a 3-minute synthetic overture in total darkness. A choice that will have you wondering if the projectionist forgot to take off the camera lid. While from a distance it may come across as a mundane or pretentious decision from an amateur director, Glazer is already subjecting the audience to the ethos of his film. The focus is on what we don't see.As Mica Levi's haunting, Aphex Twin remiscent score comes to a close, we are treated to the first image of the film, the Höss family. And for the next 2 hours, we are treated to only images of the Höss family. Never once do we as an audience get to actually witness the horrors of what lies beyond the concentration camp walls. However, that does not mean we are spared.Throughout the film, we feel the effects of the Holocaust without ever truly seeing it. Whether it be the blood-orange glow of the burnt Jewish bodies from the Auschwitz chimney being cast through the window pane of Hedwig Höss' (Sandra Huëller) upstairs guest room. The dichotomy of the Hoss children's playful laughs paired against the sorrowful howls of the tortured souls of the next door death camp. Or the dust remains of decayed Jewish skeletons dumped into the nearby river, ruining Rudolph Höss' (Christian Friedel) canoe adventure with his children. Suffering is felt at every corner of this film. Glazer masterfully crops out the harsh images of the Holocaust, but keeps them just close enough so their presence is still unavoidable. A feeling of historical tragedy that still rings true today.The film is a slow-burn, to say the least. There's never truly an inciting incident, an overly graphic scene of violence, or even really a definitive plot.Yet that is where the art of this film lies, in its subtlety.By introducing images and story-lines that are never fully realized, finished, or even acknowledged, Glazer keeps the audience on its toes by providing only a short glimpse into this family's life, all paired against the gargantuan looming walls of Auschwitz. We see young romance, joust between siblings, and family values, all without ever really learning anything about the family. We are never directly given names, ages, what their hobbies or interests are. Only minute glances at what middle-upper class German family life in the 40s would be ... next to a death camp of course.Oh yeah, the Höss family's idyllic suburban home with 6 rooms and a garden that rivals that of Francis Hodgson Burnett's, is built directly next to the infamous Auschwitz death camp. A property line that excites the family, Rudolph in particular.Rudolph, or Rudy as his wife likes to call him, is the patriarch of the family. A high-ranking officer for the Third Reich, he is one of the head guards at Auschwitz. He is a cold-blooded methodical man, who focuses on efficiency, and has a true love for his work. His wife on the other hand, Hedwig, is a high-ranking officer in an of herself. She runs the Höss family establishment, caring for 5 rambunctious children, enlisting the help of local girls for household duties, and doing whatever necessary to achieve the dream life she had ever since she was a girl, a big house and family.This description of a traditional working man, a traditional wife and their traditional family doesn't sound like much to chew on, but with the next door screams of the innocent reminding the audience who this family is, the film could not feel more tense. To portray a family of Nazis as just your average boring family, reminiscent of an American family in the 50s, is daring, to say the least. But this is exactly Glazer's intention, to bring a perspective on tragedy we have never seen before. One that, from a distance, doesn't seem harmful. But on a closer inspection, finding that the distance is the harm.Glazer however, doesn't only ever submit the audience to monotonous montages of basic family life, though it is prevalent. He instead uses the effect of monotony to then surprise his audience with choices an ideas that would never be seen in a period piece. Every so often, the film will deliver a cryptic sequence or audio effect that is a complete betrayal of the historical drama formula. The first, and most reoccurring of which, being an inverted color, night vision setting on the camera. Without warning, the film will switch to this bizarre camera setting, breaking away from the established world of the film. This subversion adds to the artistic and innovative vision of Glazer, while also avoiding gimmick.The film also has an incredible use of sound design, straying away from historical drama cliches. Rather than including songs or sounds from the 40s, Glazer utilizes the work of sound designer Johnnie Burns to craft a heavy and electronic approach that adds an incredible depth to the film. The sound bellows throughout the theatre and shakes you to your very core. This choice proves to be another masterful decision by Glazer, as it amplifies an undeniable sense of impending doom and scale that no other design could depict.The Zone of Interest is one of the most intrinsically haunting pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Its performances, originality, and lead by Johnathon Glazer undeniably makes it the best from Cannes, and one of the best films I've seen in the past decade, if not the best. Its subtlety, unique perspective, and daring choices creates a breathtaking atmosphere and movie-going experience. It's as impressive as a film can get, and represents a true understanding and mastering of cinema as an art form.10 out of 10.~townsend_reviews rated 10/10 on 29 May 2023"," The Zone of Interest: Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.~CinemaSerf rated 7/10 on 23 November 2023"," One of the most boring movies I've ever seen: Yes it's very very boring, nothing happens the first 45 minutes. Just mundane everyday things in the life of Nazi Germans. The only tension came when we thought they might have to move. This movie is living proof that tension is what makes a strong story and keeps audiences engaged. I actually fell asleep for the last 2/4 of the movie. I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas? I should research this more, but the buildings were all so much prettier than I've seen in historical photos.~Hopedoesnotdie rated 7/10 on 5 December 2023"," Great concept, lazy execution: Caught this at the LFF. As a student of Judaism, the theme of the Holocaust passionates me, and the premise of the film seemed brilliant, and I was really looking forward to it. I started to have a slight suspicion when we were treated to five minutes of a black screen with ominous music just after the opening credits.To be fair, the film does have some amazing ideas; all four of them would have made a wonderful, thought-provoking twenty minute short. As a feature film, they are not enough. After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore.~bjacob rated 4/10 on 12 October 2023"," Vacuous piece of self-indulgence: Watched this at its premiere in Cannes without any expectations whatsoever. The premise looks interesting: the head of Auschwitz lives a very paradoxically normal life with his family just behind the wall that separates them from the camp. So normal that it's filled with endless scenes of them eating, brushing their teeth, kids playing, parents reading, even sleeping while nothing else happens. Just as exciting as life in the 40's. And... that's it ! Once in a while, you can barely hear an execution or a scream on the other side of the wall while the family hardly notices at all. What is happening then is left to the viewer's imagination. Throw in some experimental, ominous and unfitting electronic music and occasional uninspired video art gimmicks and you've got a movie. There were enough ideas for a 5mn short film but it looks like the director tried his hardest to extend it into a full-length feature by all means. That was definitely not necessary. He even seemed to notice something else HAD to happen so he found something to spike this giant snoozefest a little bit: Will the husband accept to be mutated somewhere else with a higher rank ? His wife doesn't want him to, she's happy with her family life, while he's hesitant and hopes to convince the kommandantur that he can stay where they are. Big suspense. Not. Because nobody cares.This is not a difficult film to watch because of its supposed tension (there is hardly any despite all the efforts - just go spend a weekend in the German or Austrian countryside and you'll feel just the same) but because it's unbelievably boring, uneventful and empty with shockingly stale dialogue (when there is any). Glazer is no Hitchcock, Bergman or Argento. The raving reviews can only come from people who will praise anything related to the horrors of the Holocaust. This film has nothing.~Topher-26 rated 1/10 on 8 October 2023"," Much less subtle than it thinks: This is an exceptionally disappointing film, misleading historically and dramatically empty, with a boring screenplay. It wants to make a point about the proximity of Rudolf Hoss's house to the suffering victims of Nazism, but it gives no proper impression of the geography of the Auschwitz complex. Thus we see the tops of the well built Austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I, but nothing at all of Birkenau, a mile away, where the worst horrors unfolded. It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all. For the rest, the scenes are nicely shot but lacking in cinematic or dramatic interest.~D-C-S-Turner rated 2/10 on 14 October 2023"," Misleading and dull: Presumably those who made this thought they were being subtle but all they have done is produce more holocaust porn. First, they get the geography of the Auschwitiz complex all wrong. Yes Hoss's house was very close to Auschwitz I but the real horrors in 1943 were happening at Birkenau a mile away. In any case showing the top half of the very well built austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I all the time makes it seem like aregular prison. The train sounds in the backrgound are not those of a train slowing down. Hoss is presented at the end as a man with a conscience, throwing up at the prosoect of killing 700,000 hungarians. He had no conscience at all. At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs.Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong.~D-C-S-Turner rated 2/10 on 13 October 2023"," Read the book or wait to stream it at home for free!: Out of 8 people in the theatre this afternoon, 6 of us hung around in the lobby to talk about the film. We all felt the same way .... sooo boring!! After 25 minutes of commercials and we finally get the Feature Presentation sign then we get over 3 minutes of a black screen. We thought it more like 5 but usher said it was 3.Film finally starts with banal chat by the banks of a river with family fishing, swimming and beach type activities. Appr 10 minutes of what some would say notihng. BUT .. the son was picking up something on the beach which turned out to be teeth he had found to add to his growing collection.My feeling is I would probably gotten a lot more from the book that this movie. .

La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood.~cardsrock rated 8/10 on 4 January 2023"," At least an hour too long.: This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance. The all star stellar cast were all amazing, especially Margot Robbie - who was the only reason I didn't stop watching 40+ mins into this utter disastrous nonsense. The critics got this one right. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, all going to the performances and decent cinematography.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 6/10 on 1 February 2023"," I'm with the elephant!: In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.Writer/director Damien Chazelle, who gave us LA LA LAND a few years ago, turns the clock back to the 1920s when ""Hollywoodland"" was transitioning from silent pictures to sound. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie play two leading actors who flounder during this period of adjustment, cast in a series of tawdry flops. Diego Calva and Jovan Adepo play a Mexican production assistant and a jazz trumpeter whose careers briefly flare. All four stars make the best of their roles despite the chaotic screenplay. Robbie's damaged character, a stock favorite, fueled by addiction to cocaine and gambling, is overdone and risks losing the viewer's sympathy.Orgiastic parties and a weird scene in a mountain torture palace presided over by Tobey Maguire in overdrive bring echoes of historic Babylon and some of the weirder extremes of early Hollywood. And there are many references to SINGING IN THE RAIN, that gem of a film set in the same era as this mash-up - one of the all-time greatest movies. With its messy script, erratic direction and uneven editing, BABYLON is in an altogether different league. I can't think of a picture I've hated as much as this. Sorry!~davidgee rated 3/10 on 27 January 2023"," Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie: So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like. This movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is.~DeadMansTrousers rated 4/10 on 1 February 2023"," Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse: After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out.~CANpatbuck3664 rated 8/10 on 29 December 2022"," Ambitious film torpedoed by weak and self-indulgent script: As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, California 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer=director Damien Chazelle. Let me admit up front that I absolutely LOVED all three of his prior movies (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", and ""First Man""). Hence I went into this film with high expectations. Alas, I shouldn't have. ""Babylon"" certainly is well done from a technical perspective (photography, editing, musical score), but it misfires badly from a substantive perspective. The storyline is supposed to show us how Hollywood's transition from silent films into talkies was a success for some and a disaster for others. But what we get to see here is a self-indulgent, unfocused, and over-long movie, torpedoed by its weak script. (Can someone please tell me what the point of the snake fight scene was? Or of the freak show towards the end of the film? And that's just naming those two). The all-star cast certainly gives its best shot with the weak material that they are given, but in the end this film cannot be saved. This is 3+ hours of my live I'm never getting back.""Babylon"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but COVID had other ideas. It was just released in US theaters this past weekend, and vastly underperformed at the box office. Let's just say it as it is: it tanked. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 10 people). I cannot imagine that Babylon will have long legs at the box office, or that it will pick up a bunch of Oscar nominations. For that the movie is simply too weak, too long and over-indulgent for its own good. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you liked Chazelle's earlier films, I'd suggest you check this out (albeit with low expectations), and draw your own expectation.~paul-allaer rated 3/10 on 28 December 2022"," That did I just watch?: 1. It is a hig-enrgy assault on the senses. There is always something happening visually, loud music or loud screaming or loud animals aor something happening. It is over-the-top, bombastic and rarely boring.The problem? Rollercoasters are fun, but they are fun because they last about five minutes. Would you want to ride a rollercoaster for an hour or two hours....no you would not. And that is the problem with this movie. It is throwing so much at you and it does not let up long enough for you to digest the last scene. If there was a cohesive story, I missed it. If there was character development, it got lost with the direction and editing.If you are just looking for soemthing to watch and get lost in, then this works. Otherwise it is less of a movie and more of a collection of wild scenes with famous actors just slammed together.~Otte1 rated 4/10 on 20 July 2023"," Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!: My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 4/10 on 25 December 2022"," desperately trying too hard: It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far. I do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 4 February 2023"," Decadence: Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.~SaidNDone rated 7/10 on 26 December 2022"

The Life of Sir Nicholas Winton"" by Barbara Winton. Directed by James Hawes and starring Anthony Hopkins in the lead role, it is a simple human interest story that carries itself as humbly as its lead subject.In 1938, British stockbroker Nicholas ""Nicky"" Winton (Anthony Hopkins) visits Czechoslovakia to assist with matters regarding the Jewish population. While there, Nicky works hard to rescue large numbers of children to be transported back to England before the Nazis can have them sent to concentration camps. Throughout the rest of his life, Nicky is encouraged by his family to make his deeds known to the public, but he instead chooses to keep them to himself. In 1988, Nicky's wife discovers a scrapbook in their attic detailing all of the children and their families he helped save, and subsequently sends it to the media. As a result of this, Nicky's heroism receives wider acknowledgment, but is he prepared for all the attention he could garner from this?Thanks to the efforts of one man in particular, there are over 6,000 people in the world who are alive today because of his actions. That man in question is Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker who risked his life to rescue 669 children from becoming victims of the Holocaust, earning him the nickname ""The British Schindler"". However, it wasn't until half a century later that Nicholas's humanitarian work was made known to the public, when the media caught wind of his good deeds and reached out to the children and the relatives of those he saved. In the 2023 film ""One Life"", we are presented with a straightforward, respectful look at Nicholas's life in a way I am sure he would most likely approve.The film is presented to us in a fairly conventional manner, which is fine as this can be seen as a reflection of Nicholas himself, who was a relatively humble man. When we are first introduced to Nicholas, he is an elderly man in the late 1980s sifting through papers he chooses to keep hidden away from his family. Immediately afterwards, the film flashes back to 1938 where we see a twenty-something Nicholas arriving in Czechoslovakia to undertake work among the local Jewish community. It is here that Nicholas meets some of the Jewish children, with whom he forms a friendly, albeit brief bond with when he shares his chocolate bar with a select few. From here, Nicholas becomes inspired to focus his efforts on helping these children, even if it comes at the risk of attracting attention from the advancing Nazi threat.James Hawes's direction is effective at conveying Nicholas's emotional state whenever the film needs to showcase it. For instance, in one scene where we see Nicholas browsing through his scrapbook, all of the photographs and descriptions of the children are seen reflected in his glasses. The camera then zooms in on his face to show how much emotion he is filled with as he recollects all of the youths he saved and, rather tragically, the ones he could not. We see how conflicted Nicholas is in his reminiscing, as while it is true he managed to rescue so many children, he cannot escape the guilt of the ones who were far less fortunate. I was pleased to see that the film tackled this angle to Nicholas as a person as it would have been easy to only examine the positive aspects of his deeds while completely disregarding the negative. The fact of the matter is that Nicholas has always had to deal with this emotional burden, and making it public knowledge may not be what he needs to overcome his feelings of self-doubt.As the lead character, Anthony Hopkins once again proves that he's one of the best actors currently working today as he perfectly depicts the elderly Nicholas throughout all of his emotional states. Most of the time, it isn't through Hopkins's line delivery or his reaction to things, but through his body language that helps his performance leave the most impression. Aside from the aforementioned scene with the scrapbook, I also really liked this one part where Nicholas is sitting quietly in a chair by his pool overcome with the emotion of reminiscing about what he did fifty years earlier. Here, he simply sits there staring off into the distance fighting back tears until his wife arrives to comfort him. In the hands of a lesser actor, this scene may have been forgettable but Hopkins shows his ability to act using his body rather than simply through words during this scene, which gives a moment like this considerably more impact than it should.However, this is clearly a one man show, and while that does make sense in the long run, it seems like kind of a waste to include all these other notable actors and do very little with them. Helena Bonham Carter plays the young Nicholas's mother, who essentially taught him the selfless value of doing good deeds for the sake of others. Unfortunately, she is only in the film for about five minutes and these are exclusively during the flashback scenes. Similarly, Jonathan Pryce appears as the older version of one of the people whom Nicholas worked with to rescue the children. His screen time is even less than Carter's and didn't really add anything particularly important to the film. Regardless, I still appreciate that all of these actors each wanted to be part of a film that helps preserve the legacy of someone important like Nicholas Winton.Although the film can hardly be considered groundbreaking from a creative viewpoint, ""One Life"" still has moments of poignancy that are well worth your time. The subject matter alone warrants at least one viewing, as it is rare to hear about such great deeds being enacted by an uncommonly humble individual. In a world full of fake charitable people who only do nice deeds to stroke their egos, it's refreshing to know that there are people out there like Nicholas Winton who choose to do the right thing out of the kindness of their hearts. The world definitely needs more people like that, and if you can't find someone like that, be someone like that.I rate it 8/10.~MrDHWong rated 8/10 on 24 December 2023"," The World Needs More Stories Like This: Turn on the news and what do you see? Man's inhumanity to man. Ukraine, Gaza etc etc. It's enough to make you lose faith in the human race - or it would be were it not for the occasional story of humanity at its best.In Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, a small group of people (Nicholas Winton is the best known as he was the last survivor of that group) are appalled by the plight of mainly Jewish refugees, and resolve to do something. Despite opposition from governments (German, Dutch, British and American) they manage to evacuate 669 children and provide them with foster families in the UK, where many of their descendants live to this day. A further 200+ children were on a train that was scheduled to leave on the day war was declared. Fewer than a dozen of them were still alive in 1945.Then the story was forgotten for more than forty years, until at last Nicholas Winton was given the recognition he deserved (not the least astonishing part of the story is that Robert Maxwell did one decent thing in his life).The film is in two parts; the younger Winton being played by Johnny Flynn, the older by Anthony Hopkins. Both give stand-out performances. Also excellent is Helena Bonham Carter as Winton's mother. The scene where she tells a bureaucrat what she thinks of him is priceless.But the most important aspect of the film is its message. Human kindness is still a force in the world. Everyone can make a difference. No good deed, be it great or small, is ever wasted.If only governments were run by people like Nicholas Winton.~Lomax343 rated 8/10 on 29 December 2023"," Uncovering a hidden hero: Set against the backdrop of the rising Nazi threat in 1938, ""One Life"" tells the true story of Nicholas Winton, a young British stockbroker who embarks on a daring mission. Driven by a sense of humanity, Winton orchestrates the Kindertransport, rescuing hundreds of Jewish children from Czechoslovakia and bringing them to safety in Britain. The film weaves through time, showcasing the immediate impact of Winton's actions on the rescued children as well as the decades of silence that followed as Winton kept his heroic deeds under wraps. (Bard AI)One Life is an amazing story that I certainly had never heard about before. It's disappointing that it is told in such a conventional style. The story of Nicholas Winton follows a somewhat predictable trajectory, with occasional tropes we have seen in many wartime dramas. Despite this, Anthony Hopkins, who plays the older Nicholas Winton, and Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Babette Winton, both put in moving, nuanced performances that bring Winton's story alive.As we know from other wartime stories, the power of individual action in the face of incredible adversity is staggering. The fear and desperation of the child refugees is effectively portrayed, along with heartwarming moments of hope and resilience. In a story like this, the moral ambiguities, the deep resources of courage, and the profound weight of responsibility gave me plenty to think about even after the credits rolled.There were several things that detracted from the quality of the film. Pacing was a bit of a problem. Some parts of the story felt rushed, and other parts could have done with some tighter editing. The cinematography, while providing an evocative backdrop for the story, never really had the emotional weight needed for this sort of story. Some scenes bordered on being excessively sentimental, which, at times, diminished the authenticity of the movie. Some supporting characters could have done with some deeper development and backstories, and there needed to be a more balanced presentation of the story's two timelines so we could better understand the young and older versions of Winton.While One Life isn't groundbreaking, it is well made and is a valuable reminder and tribute to an extraordinary man of courage. The strengths outweigh the flaws, making it worthwhile to watch for all ages (except very young children because of the mature themes). And Winton's story makes us question whether heroism is more about big deeds or small acts of bravery. One day, each of us may be called on to be heroic, and One Life provides us with an opportunity to think about how we might choose to act in those situations. Will we have the courage to help out in the small ways that can make a big difference?~steveinadelaide rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Great film about saving children from Nazis: This film runs on two parallel tracks. In 1938-39, young British stockbroker Nicholas Winton volunteers to spend one week in Prague helping the refugee organization there organize their files. He found children who had fled Germany or German-occupied Sudetenland, and decided that he needed to get them out to Britain. That involved finding foster parents, getting visas from initially reluctant bureaucrats, and raising money, not just for the trip, but a deposit for returning the children ""when it was safe to do so"". It ended when Britain declared war on Germany, and a British visa became worthless as protection against German authorities.The other track is in 1987, when Nicky hands over his Prague scrapbook to a researcher. It included the photographs, names, and last known addresses of the children. The information went to a normally-fluffy British TV show, where Nicky was introduced to one of his ""children"" the show had found. That led to a follow-up show after many other ""Nicky's children"" contacted the TV show.This story has been the subject of at least one documentary, but not yet brought to life as a drama. The cinematography was interesting, in that the color palette could immediately inform the viewer of the time period of the story. The 1987 scenes have the bigger stars, but the 1939 scenes form the bulk of the film, and are far more gripping.I saw this at the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Due the the actors' strike, the actors were not present, but they managed to assemble maybe a dozen of Nicky's children to see their own story on the screen.~chong_an rated 9/10 on 17 September 2023"," A moving tribute: The story of Nicholas Winton, who saved hundreds of children from the Nazis just before the start of WW2 by organising trains from Czechoslovakia to the UK, is very much a story worth telling, especially as he was essentially a modest hero, one who didn't even think he deserved recognition, which makes his story all the more moving as it unfolds in flashback from late 70s Britain as Winton, superbly portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, remembers the events of the late 1930s.Of course, there have been so many WW2 dramas over the years, so I felt the pre-war scenes do somewhat lack tension and a certain freshness, but good direction and succinct writing do calmly and absorbingly set the scene, explaining those earlier events well, but we also follow the way that 40 years later the heroic efforts of Winton and his colleagues were finally revealed and celebrated, ultimately making it a truly moving and revealing film. Perhaps, considering how things look today, it's also a reminder of how good really can triumph over evil and cynicism, and it's finally a superb tribute to a remarkable man.~brockfal rated 8/10 on 28 December 2023"," Powerful: All One Life has to do to honour its true story is tell it with care and competency and that's exactly what it does. This is a deeply affecting story of selfless people who did everything they could to save as many people as possible whilst others just ignored what was going on.Anthony Hopkins is on terrific form here. He embodies the selflessness effortlessly and brings a heartbreaking sense of defeat, focusing on what he could've done rather than what he achieved. He's also one of the rare actors who can make you cry by bringing on the waterworks, when he cries you cry.In the flashbacks Johnny Flynn is an extremely convincing younger version of Hopkins with that same desire to always do more. Helena Bonham Carter gets a loveable role supporting Flynn with a stern determination and refusal to take no for an answer.James Hawes directs with a level of technical competency that's designed to go unnoticed. The production value is reminiscent of a high end BBC production, which is obviously very fitting and the pacing is really strong. Undoubtedly helped by spending the majority of the time in the flashbacks which are rife with tension.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 1 January 2024"," An inspirational true story: The story is fairly well known now, at least in the UK, but hopefully this film will bring it to the world. The film brings the story to life and how daunting and hopeless the task seemed to begin with. I had previously assumed Nicholas Winton had some sort of link to the establishment in order to get the necessary visas and other requirements. In fact, he was just an ordinary guy who felt he had to do something and, with other ordinary people, tackled each problem methodically and was able to overcome all hurdles to bring 669 mainly Jewish children out of pre-war Prague - almost certainly saving their lives.So inspiring and, indeed, heroic.With such a story, it is difficult to think that the film would not be pretty good just on that alone. However, I have seen inspiring stories fumbled before. That is not the case here. To my eyes it was handled with a deft touch aided by great performances from the ensemble cast, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helena Bonham Carter.As one might expect, the 2 timelines of pre-war Prague and the near present when the story came to light are run in parallel and that works very well, with each being moving in their own way. Together is something of an emotional overload - but in a good way. Nicky did so much but was also traumatised by those he was not able to save. Seeing all those alive today because of his efforts must have been cathartic. There is a touch of It's a Wonderful Life about the film - which is never a bad thing.The message that determined ordinary people can make a difference facing daunting obstacles is timeless. This is a true story and so not just empty rhetoric. Also, about caring for others, particularly in the face of man's ongoing inhumanity to man. Hopefully this film will inspire future Nicholas Wintons.~lawrencep0 rated 9/10 on 12 October 2023"," Exceptional piece of work: This is truly an exceptional piece of work. Having seen the trailer it could've easily been made to look and feel quite tacky but I was genuinely surprised and extremely impressed by what has been accomplished. Every step of the production was presented exactly as you would want from a time period piece and I don't recall seeing any cgi at all and certainly none which could've potentially shattered the illusion. The commitment of the actors, both past and present versions were magnificent and made you completely believe their situations. The story is an exceptional one and I'm glad that it has been told in exactly the way it was & it absolutely destroyed me & I don't think there was a dry eye left from anyone in the cinema screening that I watched it in. Anything which gives me the immediate emotional reaction that this did means that it deserves a full 5 stars.~karlmartin-47352 rated 10/10 on 1 January 2024"," Superb storytelling Superb performances: My Review - One LifeIn Cinemas nowMy Rating 10/10Before I begin this review I have to say that it was impossible for me not to be moved by Nicholas Winton story without looking at it through the prism of World events today, in the hope that perhaps there is a Nicholas Winton working in the background to save the innocent children caught up in todays war torn world.One of the end credits of this fine movie states that Nicholas Winton left his scrapbook to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel . My hope is that the politicians in Israel look at this scrapbook and learn its lessons as was Nicholas Winton's wish for his legacy to teach rather than preach.Already more than 6,600 Palestinian children that's ten times more than the 660 children Nicholas Winton helped rescue have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Gaza and not forgetting the estimated 535 children killed in the conflict in Ukraine .The movie One Life skilfully directed by James Hawkes is based on the true story of British humanitarian Nicholas Winton .The role of young Nicholas Winton is played by Johnny Flynn who perfectly compliments his older self played by Anthony Hopkins .Anthony Hopkins in my opinion is one of the most skilful actors in the business today . Every one of his performances is a masterclass study in understanding empathy and humility rarely does his characterisation seem forced or contrived that can't be said of many actors.One Life is set in two eras 1938 to 1939 during the beginning of World War 11 when the German Army occupied and invaded Czechoslovakia .Then nearly 50 years later in 1987 Anthony Hopkins as the elderly Nicholas Winton looks back on his past efforts to help groups of Jewish children in German-occupied Czechoslovakia .A humble quiet man not seeking notoriety but wanting his experience to be preserved in an effort to perhaps stop the same events occurring again is thrust into the limelight of a television show with an amazing result.We see how the traumatic events on his arrival in Prague when he first witnesses the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the cruel Nazi regime prompts him to initiate an escape plan for the children of targeted parents in an effort to avoid their obvious fate if left to the mercy of the invading German army.With the help of his colleagues in Prague and his mother Babette Winton played by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter in one of her best supporting roles in years he forms the life saving operation known asthe Czech Kindertransport .His mother battles the government bureaucracy back home in an effort to locate foster parents and visas to bring the children to freedom in England while Nicholas Winton and his team in Prague organise transport and try to locate the lists of endangered children from the Jewish authorities after gaining their trust.Wonderful ensemble supporting performances from Romola Garai, Alex Sharp, Jonathan Pryce, Lena Olin. Tom Glenister, Samantha Spiro and many more bring this emotional heartfelt true story to life on screen.It's so wonderful for this moviegoer to end 2023 with 2 movies in a row that I consider among the best of the year , especially on Sir Anthony Hopkin's 86th Birthday may you be blessed with many more days One at a Time.~tm-sheehan rated 10/10 on 31 December 2023"," Heartbreaking & Heartwarming: I rarely concern myself with the opinions of others, especially professional critics, but some of the negative reviews I've read about this are churlish to say the least. I think one of the big positives of this film is that it just tells the story. Most of us in UK probably know the story of Sir Nicholas Winton and how he organised the transport of 669 Czech Jewish children to relative safety in the UK in the face of the Nazi onslaught in the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. Despite what some suggest, it clearly shows that this is a team effort led by Winton's persistence and determination; it does not make him out to be the sole hero. However, as important as the evacuations is the story about how it came into the British consciousness via the quirky 1970s BBC TV show, 'That's Life.' It truly is something that needed to be told, then and now, and is done so in a suitably serious nut heartwarming manner. Do go and see it and do be prepared for the final scenes.~GB65 rated 9/10 on 1 January 2024"

Being uruguayan, this story holds a very special place in my heart. I think all of us are linked to the survivors in one way or the other. Luckily we have most of them still around us. They're either the father of a colleague at work, the grandparent of a classmate at school, a friend of a friend's uncle.In my case, Roberto Canessa was my cardiologist when I was a teenager. He specialized in congenital heart diseases. My parents were alive when the accident happened. I grew up reading books and old news about flight 571. Every anniversary of the rescue we would see videos and photos of the survivors on TV. So when my parents told me that my new doctor was going to be Roberto, this astounding man, I felt like I was about to meet Superman. And when I met him I swear I could feel this peaceful energy coming from him. He was so gentle, so humble. It still brings tears to my eyes to think that my doctor was the same young man that crossed the Andes to save his friends. I cherish those moments I shared with him at his office a lot.""What's the point of this?"", Numa asks at the second half of the movie. There was no point. There's no reason behind the accident. What's important it's what they did after the accident. They could have chosen to stay and wait for their deaths, but instead they decided to keep fighting for their lives until the end. And thanks to that, they survived and became the men they are today. In Roberto's case, he survived to be a cardiologist who saves children's lives. He had to survive. That's his reason.~pauedi1998 rated 10/10 on 21 December 2023"," Amazing adaptation: I had the pleasure of seeing Society of the Snow at the Stockholm International Film Festival today.

It is based very acutely on the facts that occurred during a crash landing of a charter flight on its way from Uruguay to Chile in 1972 carrying a rugby team and some guests. This is the third attempt at this subject in movie format and I think they finally got it right. It works on all levels. The stress, survival of the fittest, morals and philosophy of dealing with the most dire situation and uniting together to conquer the odds. I'm not giving anything away here since the story has been told in a book and a couple of movies. But this one is going to take the Oscar for best International Film 2024 no doubt. It is the strategy of Netflix but it deserves it. It delivers and they spared no expense to make sure it does. The mountain location work, aerial helicopter and drone shots, along with the actors starving themselves, makes for one of the most dynamic movies I've come across in awhile. I live in tinseltown and have worked on some of the big ones and I can stand by my word - this is a standout movie not to be missed. If you've ever spent time in the mountains you will so get it.

The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.As a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.What seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.Everything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break. But if that's done in order to emphasize the frustration felt by the team players, it succeeds tremendously.~naq-1 rated 9/10 on 1 December 2023"," Goes under the skin: If you get the chance, I'd recommend watching this film in a movie theater. It is an intense and beautifully shot movie about the Uruguayan flight that crashed in the Andes in 1972. Due to the actors' great performance and the very good production value, you seem to feel the despair that the survivors must have felt and sometimes even the cold they must have felt. You get to understand how hard and horrendous the decision must have been to eat the deceased in order to get a chance to survive.The cinematography is great and the beautiful shots of the Andes contrast sharply with the forlorn situation the survivors find themselves in. The flight crash was very well executed and seemed quite realistic.This movie might be uncomfortable to watch and some people might feel at unease with the some of the depicted events, but other than that I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the specific event and/or human resilience when faced with adverse circumstance and low odds of survival.~jansouverein rated 8/10 on 28 December 2023"," The title says it all: First, let's get something out of the way: ""Society of the Snow"" is not a remake of ""Alive"" (1993), just like James Cameron's ""Titanic"" wasn't a remake of 1958's ""A Night to Remember"", which also wasn't a remake of any previous Titanic-centered movies. This is the adaptation of a different book covering the story of the Andes survivors - another take on the same real-life event.As directed by J. A. Bayona (back at the survival thriller genre after 2012's ""The Impossible"") and led by a group of unknown Uruguayan and Argentinean actors, ""Society of the Snow"" is not only authentically cast and produced, but powerfully moving in its conception of narrative.There's an unexpected focal character here, but the movie plays out as an ensemble piece and, true to its title, portrays every person as essential to the outcome. There's a feeling that those who lost their lives were just as responsible for the ultimate rescue of their remaining friends as those who eventually reached civilization to seek help - not just for selflessly volunteering their bodies for food, but for providing comfort, solidarity, acceptance, even humor!, under the most dreadful of circumstances.This is a movie that will stay with you. Please, don't miss out on it.~vidovix-louis rated 10/10 on 28 December 2023"," Gripping Survival Saga Unfolds: Cinematic Excellence Amidst Majestic Mountains: I adored this film, seen during the Filmmaker Forum in San Francisco. It's a powerful, emotionally charged story based on true events-a plane crash leaving 27 survivors stranded on debris in the Andes mountains.Narrated through Numa's perspective, the movie beautifully captures the characters' struggle for survival, showcasing moments of camaraderie and the fight for their lives. The realism, coupled with fantastic music, makes it a gripping emotional roller coaster.Kudos to the crew for overcoming the challenges of a difficult production, shot in the mountains of Spain, and bringing this compelling story to the screen.~capturedbybarbara rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," One of the best movies I've seen: Hear me out, I'm a cinephile and I can say this movie is really something else. Netflix invested a lot of money in this movie but it's definitely s movie you want to see in the theaters. Don't watch it if you're looking for some lighthearted entertainment.Based in a real story and it's a lot to take in, specially if you know the story behind this movie or if you've watched the past movie about this tragedy (or miracle): Alive.Pedro Luque, in charge of photography, really shines in this one. It has some surprising cameos with actual survivors. All my respect to the team that made this master piece.~pocketrubin rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," The human spirit in full flight: Already having seen Alive several times and beingv familiar with the 1972 story, I honestly didn't believe it necessary to see this version.However a good friend persuaded me to go see it and the rest is history!This is without doubt the definitive version, the story is told with authenticity and a v keen Director's eye.I was worried about the foreign subtitles, but needn't have been since it kept me in the movie and made the connection to all the players even more heartfelt.This is a reminder to us all, that nothing is impossible and when facing insurmountable adversity the human spirit is capable of triumph!

The Northman (2022) - IMDb,7.0,Alexander Skarsgård|Nicole Kidman|Claes Bang|Ethan Hawke|Anya Taylor-Joy|Gustav Lindh|Elliott Rose|Willem Dafoe|Phill Martin|Eldar Skar|Olwen Fouéré|Edgar Abram|Jack Gassmann|Ingvar Sigurdsson|Oscar Novak|Jack Walsh|Björk|Ian Whyte,Robert Eggers,Sjón|Robert Eggers,A young Viking prince is on a quest to avenge his father's murder.," Metal AF 🤘: This is without a doubt the most Heavy Metal movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. I'm gonna crank up some Amon Amarth later.Robert Eggers is one of the most exciting and original directors out right now. The Northman is his third full-length film and it just might be my favorite. The Northman is a classic revenge tale (very reminiscent of both Conan The Barbarian and Gladiator) that becomes elevated due to its incredible visuals, uncompromising brutality, fantastic performances, stunning musical score, and authentic depictions of Norse Mythology and Viking history.Although this is probably Eggers's most accessible film (at least in comparison to both The Witch and The Lighthouse) that hardly makes it accessible to most mainstream audiences, which is probably why this film tanked at the box office. But if you love amazing visuals with brutal action sequences and compelling performances, then odds are you're gonna dig The Northman. Its story and themes may not be the most original, but because this film is so technically flawless, the experience that you get in return is well worthwhile.Also, it is absolutely criminal that this movie didn't get any Oscar nominations, ESPECIALLY for best cinematography. I guess this movie was just too metal for the academy voters.~nathandm-75297 rated 9/10 on 2 March 2023", Surprisingly mediocre: Where do I start? No real drama. No character development. The most cornball dialogue. Sloppy plot. Poor use of a potentially spectacular landscape. Bland soundtrack. I think any episode of VIKINGS would surpass this film. I was blown away by how ordinary it was and almost walked out. It was cinema by numbers that added up to far less than its parts. This film should have been absolutely epic. Terribly disappointing. It was well over two hours of boredom. Anyone claiming it a masterpiece should be banned from entering Valhalla!~CtlAltDel rated 4/10 on 26 April 2022," Brutally marvellous.: Hate, revenge, fury and spilled blood, a pretty accurate look back at history.It's an era I am truly fascinated by, it's not one that's always accurately portrayed, in the case of The Northman, it felt as though efforts were made to make a fairly accurate set of events.Two things stood out, the visuals, the music, it's a true feast for the senses, visually it is of epic proportions, with incredible use of the landscapes, costumes and special effects, the gore was appropriate, it felt realistic. The music was incredible, and added to the vibe of the film.The acting, on the whole was terrific, Alexander Skarsgård and Claes Bang in particular, I loved the scenes with Bjork too. The only questionable casting decision for me was Nicole Kidman, I felt she was out of place here.Thrilling, exciting, pretty accurate, for a long film it moved by very quickly, 9/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 9/10 on 11 December 2022"," This is not an action movie...: This is not a viking version of Die Hard. This isn't an M. Night Shyamalan movie with a cute twist. It's absolutely not a movie with modern sensibilities.This is a tale in the style of an epic myth. It showcases classic themes of betrayal, vengeance, and sacrifice through a brutal mix of realism and symbolism.It's unapologetically not for everyone. And it's bloody fantastic.~JLEV-IMDB rated 9/10 on 16 August 2022"," It delivered less than I had expected...: Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention. And I figured that with the movie's 7.8 rating on IMDb, in this writing moment, then I would be in for something grand here.And I will admit that I was excited to see what writers Sjón and Robert Eggers had in store for me here with the 2 hours and 17 minutes that the movie ran for.However, I must say that while ""The Northman"" was watchable, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill Viking-inspired movie, for better or worse. Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then ""The Northman"" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era.""The Northman"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Björk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in ""The Northman"", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me. Sure, I understand that the Valkyries are a part of Norse lore, but having a pale woman with retainers on her teeth screaming and sitting on a flying horse just doesn't really work.I was expecting more than just your average generic Viking movie from director Robert Eggers, and I was somewhat disappointed when the movie just turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Viking movie. It could and should have been so much more, especially for a production of this magnitude.While ""The Northman"" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, then this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of ""The Northman"" lands on a six out of ten stars. It is the atmosphere, the brutality in the movie, and some of the performances that managed to snag the rating up from five to a six star rating for me.~paul_haakonsen rated 6/10 on 12 May 2022"," Who knew Vikings and Vengeance could be such a boring combination?: I won't waste too much time with this one. If you've had the misfortune to watch the recent movie ""The Green Knight"" then be prepared for more of the same pseudo art-house nonsense here.Coming from ""visionary"" director Robert Eggers (if you ask me, he's had one too many ""visions"") this is a dull, tedious slog. Now, as my title suggests, it seems inconceivable (yes I do know what that word means!) that putting vikings and a tale of vengeance together could be such a dud, but here it is.The Northman manages to take a story that should easily fit in the old 90 minute movie bracket and pad it out to nearly two and a quarter hours. The padding comes in the form of trippy daydreams/hallucinations by the main character as he suffers to satisfy his vengeance. Yeah, you'll want to skip those if you can.I've only given this as many points as I have because at least there was a small twist in the story, albeit a blindingly obvious one to do with the ""hero's"" mother. That, and the ending which...lets just say it isn't surprising given the story. That lack of surprise ending will still leave you with that sinking feeling. A feeling that you've just wasted two hours of your life on what amounts to an episode of Vikings that was discarded in the writer's room.SUMMARY: Going to Iceland (the store) is less tedious and frustrating than going to Iceland (the place) in this movie. Too much ""visionary"" and not enough ""entertaining"" in this one. Skip it, watch Vikings again, or Conan, or 13th Warrior or Outlander (2008). All are much, much more fun.~Rob_Taylor rated 5/10 on 1 June 2022"," Well Produced, but Dark, Slow and Not Engaging: I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 6/10 on 23 April 2022"," Hawke The Slayer: This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping ""The Northman"" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is ""The Green Knight"", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but ""The Northman"" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold.~southdavid rated 5/10 on 19 April 2022"," As a Scandinavian, I loved it: This is probably the only Viking-related entertainment I have ever watched to thoroughly respect and appreciate our heritage. What a fantastic cast, cinematography and blend of realism and the supernatural. Absolutely masterfully crafted.Netflix and Marvel can try their best to ruin the image of my ancestors. All I can say is thank god for Eggers and The Northman.~larshermans rated 9/10 on 23 April 2022", Long and boring: My impression of this film is that they shot a few cool viking scenes - and decided to make a story around it and just sew it together.Starts of pretty awkward then moves on to some cool raiding then it's back to awkward drama and weird scenes. Then it's a lot of fight talking then it's drama again. Then it's hallucinations and finally the movie ends.Alexander is a BEAST but the movie is so poorly edited and the story is....

""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.~Gordon-11 rated NA on 19 October 2009"," Awesome: The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""~ebiros2 rated 10/10 on 17 October 2005"," One of the best movies ever made.: Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 26 January 2023"," Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.: Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.~Fella_shibby rated 10/10 on 9 September 2013"," You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.: History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.~mark.waltz rated 10/10 on 29 August 2014"," Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely. ⭐: As you may know there is lots of World War II movies.

It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.~vtburns rated NA on 11 December 2000"," Spielberg's most important work: Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.~SnoopyStyle rated 10/10 on 23 March 2014"," The most shattering film of all time.: I've seen this film one time in 1994.

The Great Escape (1963) - IMDb,8.2,Steve McQueen|James Garner|Richard Attenborough|Charles Bronson|James Donald|Donald Pleasence|James Coburn|Hannes Messemer|David McCallum|Gordon Jackson|John Leyton|Angus Lennie|Nigel Stock|Robert Graf|Jud Taylor|Hans Reiser|Harry Riebauer|William Russell,John Sturges,Paul Brickhill|James Clavell|W.R. Burnett,Allied prisoners of war plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a German camp during World War II.," ""We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely."": The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 17 September 2006"," If you're going to critique the history, then know the history.: I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.~FABabe rated NA on 31 January 2003"," The Great Movie: The Germans, ""with madness in their method"" have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts to escape and put them in a POW camp which they have devised to be inescapable. Under the supervision of Richard Attenborough, they immediately begin to dig tunnels to break out 250 men.There are anhistorical elements here. There were four tunnels dug, not the three in the movie; the date of the escape was changed; most notably, several American flyers took part in the breakout. While Americans did take part in the planning and construction, they had been moved to a different camp by the time of the event. This was an American film, and director John Sturges had been trying to get this project off the ground for the better part of a decade before he and the Mirisches got United Artists to foot the bill, so James Garner, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson (as a Pole) got major roles. UA also wanted a shorter running time, and some women, which Sturges was able to resist.It's a great, gripping blend of suspense and thrills, with some pawky humor thrown in, and a canny shift in camerawork. The first two-thirds, with its closed-in spaces sustains an element of oppression, culminating with the breakout, at night in the confined space of the tunnel. This is followed by brightly lit and open vistas as the escapees make their ways towards freedom. Because Sturges had directed THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the remake of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I thought for many years this dichotomy was taken from Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW. However, the latter picture was released four months after Sturges'.170 minutes is a very long time for a feature film, and this was undoubtedly released in a road show version with an intermission. The natural place for a break would be right after the Germans discover the primary tunnel. Nowadays, when I watch this, I can take a break whenever I like. Even knowing how it comes out, it's a struggle to stop the movie at any point.~boblipton rated 10/10 on 13 January 2022"," Not just great, simply magnificent more like!: ""Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10~hitchcockthelegend rated 10/10 on 4 March 2008"," Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...: I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.~planktonrules rated 9/10 on 27 December 2011"," A vast, multi-star war epic with great score by Elmer Bernstein...: 'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source, and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner, giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half, allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor, excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended, and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers, mostly pilots, being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant', Von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald), 'We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps, Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X,' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture, and plans to strike back, getting as many men as possible out of the camp, in order to 'harass, confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry... The plan, so precise, proceeds in an orderly fashion, with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity, which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn), the 'Cooler King,' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner), the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger', and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence,' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German ""Ferrets."" Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole,' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps, repeated failed escape attempts, and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious, and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation... It graphically shows what enterprising men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances... It has a great cast, and is beautifully made...~Nazi_Fighter_David rated 9/10 on 18 July 2001"," Behind the Wire: Exactly fifty years ago this month I first saw this on BBC1 with the never to be repeated news that it was ""the first ever screening on British television"".The fact that it's deservedly become a classic obscures the fact that (SPOILER COMING:) director John Sturges was adamant about retaining the ending of John Brickhill's 1956 bestseller, which for several years made it an impossible pitch until he enjoyed a huge hit with 'The Magnificent Seven' and was finally able to interest the money men by reuniting three of The Seven.To keep costs down it was shot in Europe, and the authentic German locations - and the largely British supporting cast - simply made the result even more distinctive.~richardchatten rated 10/10 on 31 December 2021"," We Choose the Cooler: Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein  to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100.~tedg rated NA on 23 February 2001"," Fantastic Movie: They will never make movies like this again...

Many of the female characters were quite one dimensional (although that may be due to the time period of it). Some of the allegories the film attempted to make were forced. The slapstick comedy with religion was pretty clever, but it didn't make up for a lot of the unexplained hijinks throughout the film. Although, it did make some great, hilarious use of both McAvoy and Cumberbatch in some minor yet great roles. Jeymes Samuel certainly has unique visions and a place in the future of filmmaking, but for me, this one fell a little short.~dylanak-18026 rated 6/10 on 11 October 2023"," It lost me in the 3rd act: Imagine The Life of Brian ending with dire seriousness, rather than a joyously silly ending with the crucified singing from their crosses. This film evolved from something I enjoyed to something I would avoid.There were new ideas explored in the first two acts, and there were genuine laughs. For example, there was a slapstick scene with John the Baptist I found particularly funny.The colours were saturated, and the Italian town standing in for Jerusalem was impressive. The musical score was developed by the writer/director, and it added humour at times. I didn't expect to see choreographed disco dancing in first century Jerusalem.However, in the third act, the film changes course and tone. The film turns earnest, and there is a miraculously ""happy"" ending. It was such a disappointment. The writer/director comes across as a true believer recruiting for the faith. If it had held its tone and retained its healthy scepticism, I would have rated it.Unfortunately, the third act turns deadly serious, and is more The Passion of the Christ than The Life of Brian.

There are shades of Kubrick in the editing and cinematography, both of which are excellent. The use of natural light and distorted lenses is visually interesting. The costumes are also top notch, as one would expect from a period piece.The performances are the main event, with all three women turning in at or near career bests. Colman won the Best Actress Oscar, but her's is the most in line with a supporting turn, as the film is told from the points-of-view of Weisz and Stone. Their increasingly nasty one upmanship is hilarious. Lanthimos throws in some anachronistic touches (the dance scene is very amusing), the dialogue is sharp as a dagger, and the film isn't afraid to go grotesque. Recommended.~AlsExGal rated 8/10 on 22 December 2022"," Fans of Yorgos Lanthimos will love it. I'm not sure about everyone else: The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy Rachel Weisz) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (Emma Stone, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising Olivia Colman), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor Efthimis Filippou wrote (the script was originally written by Deborah Davis in 1998 and later refined by Tony McNamara). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are Sandy Powell's costume design, Fiona Crombie's production design, and Robbie Ryan's cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, ""what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings."" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, ""How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.""As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.Superior to Alpeis (2011) and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on Kynodontas (2009) or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.~Bertaut rated 7/10 on 20 January 2019"," delicioius: English Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is fighting a war in France. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is her favorite courtesan and is the power behind the throne. Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.This is a wonderful competition of female relationships. It is deliciously passive-aggressive. All three performances are amazing. The visual style is impeccable. It is a movie of singular vision and great actors.~SnoopyStyle rated 8/10 on 6 September 2019"," Wow!!: In early 18th century, the friendship between Anne, first Queen of Great Britain and Lady Sarah Churchill, the wife of the Duke of Marlborough, was very close and then deteriorated because of their differing political views and the growing influence of another favorite, Abigail Masham. The film focuses on the rivalry between these 2 women, Abigail and Sarah: lousy tricks, alliances, treacheries, ground shiftings, sex, ... Everything is allowed to obtain the favors of the queen!The actors, the photography, the costumes, the 18th century atmosphere despite voluntary anachronisms, the rhythm, the dialogues, the soundtrack, ... This is an excellent achievement. Smart, dark, irreverent, cruel and immoral.~FrenchEddieFelson rated 9/10 on 20 February 2019"," Lanthimos Delivers... But The Ending Could Use Some Work: Sumptuous and stunning. With THE FAVOURITE, director Yorgos Lanthimos delivers his best film yet - one that works as both a historical drama and a sex comedy that features beautiful cinematography courtesy of Robbie Ryan (Lanthimos really loves him some fisheye lenses) and gorgeous costume design courtesy of Sandy Powell (just give her the Oscar already because wow). Lanthimos, working for the first time with a screenplay that he didn't co-write, deals primarily with themes of power and the way it impacts the three women at the center of the film. Despite not having had a hand in writing the screenplay, Lanthimos seems to be in his wheelhouse, crafting a stirring yet (darkly) humorous rumination on humankind's innate desire to posses power, whether it be political, sexual, or anything in between. Granted, Lanthimos is also working with some of the most talented actresses working today and the big three (Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone) all deliver some of the best work of their career. As crazy as it might sound, however, and despite Colman's Best Actress win at Venice for her portrayal of Queen Anne, this is Stone's film. I'm already frustrated by the fact that she will be campaigned in the Best Supporting Actress field despite the fact that the film wholly follows her arc. That's not to take anything from Colman, whose performance is likely the most impressive of the three, but I do feel it's something to take note of.However, the film isn't flawless, and it once again demonstrates that Lanthimos' greatest weakness as a director is his inability to deliver a satisfying conclusion. I loved THE LOBSTER, but the last ten minutes left a bitter taste in my mouth that I detested. I was a bit cooler on THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and the last ten minutes proved a bit too dark for me. This time, even a great final shot isn't enough to save the last fifteen minutes of the film from seeming necessary. The film simply (and suddenly) runs out of steam before it crosses the finish line - an unfortunate occurrence considering the fact that nearly everything before it proved wickedly entertaining. That being said, I'm excited to see what Lanthimos does next. I just hope he nails the ending.~roblesar99 rated 8/10 on 22 September 2018"," Unsettling favouritism: 'The Favourite' from the day it came out quickly became one of my most anticipated films. Mainly for the critical acclaim, the vast awards attention and the talented cast (namely Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz). Anybody who has seen and liked Yorgos Lanthimos' previous films, including 'The Lobster', would also find another reason to be psyched about seeing it. Interesting furthermore for seeing a monarch and reign/era not explored an awful lot on film and actually even in general.Seeing it finally last weekend with my sister, 'The Favourite' didn't disappoint me at all. Completely agree with the acclaim (and just to say there have been times where that has not always been the case) and the award nominations, with it receiving the most nominations of the year along with 'Roma' (another favourite of the year), and hopefully wins for at least a few of the categories are richly deserved. Just to say that my sister also loved it and she knew very little about its critical reception and accolades until when we were talking about the film afterwards, so this is not a case of being ""followers"" and this is a genuine review from somebody who actually did love it and has been known quite a number of times before for going against the grain when it comes to critical consensus. With that being said, can understand why 'The Favourite' won't click, and hasn't clicked, for some. But what some have deemed bizarre, cruel and pointless for me was one of the most entertaining, most visually striking, best acted and surprising films of the year.Won't say that 'The Favourite' is exempt from criticism. Do have to agree with everybody who found the ending disappointing. Far too abrupt and it didn't make sense, leaving a very odd feeling and aftertaste.However, the production values are exemplary. It is a beautifully shot and cleverly edited film, with a few effectively nightmarish moments that didn't distract at all (this is including at the end). All of this complements the evocative attention to period detail and the sumptuous locations interiors and exteriors. Especially good in this regard are the costumes, gorgeously designed and opulent and the muted colour pallette for some of them looks tasteful. Lanthimos keeps things going at a breezy pace while allowing it all to breathe, the surreal and strange elements that has not appealed to all in his previous films certainly present but more toned down here in comparison, which makes 'The Favourite' one of his more accessible films in my view.Do not agree with those panning the soundtrack. Sure, the Ferrari and Messiaen weren't to my tastes and some of the placement is repetitive in places, but the pieces featured are great pieces on their own. The most authentic uses being Bach, Vivaldi and Purcell (including one of his most beautiful songs ""Music for a while""), but most effective was the Schumann Piano Quintet (the opening chords and rhythms are truly haunting) and the poignantly sombre Schubert Piano Sonata, which happened to be one of his last works before his ultimely death. Apart from the repetition, the placement mostly didn't bother me with none of it really juxtaposing with the mood of the scenes (mixing a little camp and just as much seriousness) in question, there is a teasing and disorienting quality that is oddly captivating and clever.One of 'The Favourite's' biggest triumphs is the script, one of the most entertaining and most beautifully balanced and structured of the year. Many parts are irreverently witty, boasting a number of laugh out loud moments throughout and showing a farce with teeth and bite without being over-the-top or tired. It is also quite darkly disarming and pulls no punches, showing that a period that seems so beautiful and glamorous is not as much as appeared underneath. There is shock value here but it didn't feel that gratuitous and was one of the reasons as to why 'The Favourite' stands out as more than one's ""typical"" idea of a period film. The political elements are sharp and insightful. And then there is a sensuality that both disturbs and charms, the chemistry between the three leads being witty, chilling and tense. On a story level, only the ending misfired for me, everything else is thoroughly absorbing and the different tones and shifts are balanced expertly with no real jarring, the twists in the story being manic without being too much that one can't take it seriously and the deceptions really digging deep.A great job is done getting quality performances from the cast, all thoroughly committing to their roles and avoiding falling too much in overplayed caricature. Anne especially in her human fraility is given a good deal of depth that one does root for her, and the film did well providing some poignant emotion when needed without being overt amongst all the strangeness and irreverence. The supporting cast are on point, with Nicholas Hoult being particularly enjoyable in a very gleeful way. It's the three female leads that carry 'The Favourite' and all three give performances that are among the best of the year. Emma Stone is alluring and one roots for her at first, while making Abigail's shrewish character change unsettlingly believable. A perhaps never better Rachel Weisz brings caustic wit and authority to Sarah. Even better is Olivia Colman, a truly magnificent performance that gives the character many shades and vulnerability.Summing up, a great film and one of my favourite films of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 5 February 2019"," Uncomfortable and a bit boring despite its talent: The script for this star-studded period comedy-drama has been in circulation since the late 90s and has finally been greenlit with writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and Director Yorgos Lanthimos. The setting is early 18th Century England (filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire!) Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is in rule and assisted by her close friend and confidante Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant arrives, Abigail (Emma Stone), who starts to work up the ranks and gain the trust of Queen Anne. And so begins a dangerous rivalry. This is the third film I have seen by Lanthimos and both films previously were completely different sides of the spectrum for me. I really didn't like Dogtooth; although it was an interesting premise, I found its rough edges to be too rough and isolating which I guess is the point of the film but not for me. On the other hand, I absolutely loved The Lobster which was a genuinely brilliant, funny yet darkly savage look at a dystopian future. The Favourite leans more towards the former for me; it felt strangely uninvolving despite the good performances and I found myself just looking at the screen rather than being engaged as it went on. There are some brilliant moments though particularly thanks to Olivia Colman who is stunningly great as always; the close up camera shots of her are so good, portraying the pathos and sadness of the character of Anne extremely well. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are also great as ever and have a lot of fun in the roles of consistently trying to outsmart the other. There is a brutal moment involving self-mutilation with a book that reminded me of the most shocking moments in The Lobster. The ending frames are also hauntingly amazing; edited beautifully by Yorgos Mavropsaridis! Lanthimos is a master of uncomfortable atmosphere and brooding darkness which can go either way; in the case of The Favourite it's a bit of a mixed bag. When it works particularly during the eerily quiet moments, it's really good but when it's uncomfortably bizarre which is the majority of the time it's a bit of a numb watch~jamiedarlow-37510 rated 4/10 on 29 February 2020"," Funny and with extremely memorable characters, The Favourite is a fun and weird character-driven period drama: While Lanthimos continues his eccentric and absurdist filmmaking tendencies, The Favourite is still an easy one to get behind and think deeply about. The premise is essential to all of the plot machinations: in early 18th century England, we are in Queen Anne's court, where political power and maneuvering is everything. Queen Anne is an entertaining central figure, as while all politics revolve around her and she can do what she wants, she also seems like a puppet and easily influenced. The real heart of the movie is Abigail's character arc and her rivalry with Sarah. Abigail, played wonderfully by Emma Stone (who in my opinion should've been considered the lead actress, not Olivia Colman), comes from a family who was wealthy but fell far, and comes to her cousin Sarah looking for a job in the palace. Sarah is intelligent, knowledgeable in the political game, and the Queen's closest adviser. Abigail is immediately who we root for, as an outsider ready to work hard and earn a successful role near the Queen. We see her develop from believing that the best way to rise is through honor and loyalty, but quickly sees that everyone is playing political games and becomes ruthless in outstripping Sarah for the Queen's affection. The script is phenomenal and treats the characters very consistently but never one-dimensionally, by clearly showing their motivations but also portraying them realistically as humans. The humor really works, from the absurdist touches like the duck races to the funny dialogue, like when Sarah tells the Queen she looks like a badger and the Queen agrees. The ending, while an ambiguous one, I think symbolizes the Queen's loneliness and struggle for control, as that final shot of Abigail rubbing her leg fades into rabbits. There seems to be a lot going on, but really it's a fun character drama between these three players in an extremely politically charged and power driven society, and particularly Abigail's development and increasing ruthlessness within that framework. On all of those counts, it's very successful as a film, balancing coherence and intelligent filmmaking with innovation and quirks as Lanthimos always does. Every scene builds up and further develops the characters, and none contradict or seem meaningless, which is a sign of a great movie and great script.Purely for my own future memory, I'm copying down a line I thought was really funny: ""Obviously you have chosen to keep the particulars of your dismissal from me. I shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that.""~andrewroy-04316 rated 8/10 on 23 February 2019"," A classic case of overplaying one's hand: After having seen and become a fan of the very first series on Masterpiece Theater The First Churchills, I was anxious to see the different slant The Favouritehad on what is an enlargement of the last years of that story. As The FirstChurchills was based on Winston Churchill's biography of his ancestor The Dukeof Marlborough it was as expected slanted toward Sarah Jennings Churchill.Accounts other than Churchill's cast Sarah as a shrew. As you see in the FirstChurchills, Sarah and Anne grew up together as playmates and were the mostintimate of friends since puberty. When they were apart they wrote letters andgave each other pen names for their letters. Anne was Mrs. Morley and Sarahwas Mrs. Freeman. The Duke of Marlborough was a great military commander, but no doubt his wife's influence with first Princess Anne whenshe was in line for succession and when she became Queen in 1702 the Marlboroughs were riding high.The First Churchills had Margaret Tyzack as Anne who over the course of theseries grew from an eager young princess to a rather dowdy queen. OliviaColman's portrayal of Anne is of a woman who has nothing really left but thethrone. This woman had several pregnancies from her husband, the longestsurviving of their children who wasn't stillborn lived to be 9. Her husband aprince from Denmark also died.By the time this all takes place Anne who patiently put up with Sarah Churchill's constant begging of favors and trying to influence policy was ripefor a new favorite. And in The Favourite Sarah herself introduces her owndownfall into Anne's court with her own cousin Abigail Hill. It was a classiccase of overplaying one's hand.The three actresses who play Anne, Sarah, and Abigail dominate this film.Olivia Colman won the film's only Oscar for Best Actress playing Queen Anneand she is dowdy, tired, mercurial and plain tired and world weary all at once.Quite a few people died before she who never expected to be queen was. Byall accounts she was a nice woman before being overwhelmed with theresponsibility's of the throne. There's also more than a hint of a lesbian relationship with Anne and Sarah. Getting all those emotions out and thensome is the hallmark of a great performance.Rachel Weisz plays Sarah who like Susan Hampshire in The First Churchills justnever knew when to quit. Emma Stone as Abigail knew exactly when to quit.She made a good marriage to Sam Masham who became a Baron. When Annedied, Abigail knew it was time to gracefully bow it. She lived quietly in thecountryside and died in 1734. Sarah way outlived both Anne and Abigaildying 1748. Her saved correspondence provide a lively account of her erawritten from Sarah's point of view.The Favourite's only Oscar was for Olivia Colman. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both got Supporting Actress nominations and the film also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other awards.I really recommend seeing this and then getting a copy of The First Churchills.Or you might read Winston Churchill's award winning biography of the Duketo get Sarah's side in that magnificent Churchillian prose.~bkoganbing rated 9/10 on 10 March 2019"

There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.Opens on May 12, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 8/10 on 11 May 2023"," It's funny until it's not.: It's a Canadian comedy-drama techno-history set from 1996 to 2008 in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is a fictional story inspired by the rise and fall of Research in Motion (RIM), the company that created Blackberry, the initial smartphone.The film first introduces us to Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) as a profane hard-driving executive at Sutherland-Schultz who meets Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and Douglas Fregin (Matt Johnson), two awkward techies trying to sell a new product called a smartphone. Lazaridis is the CEO of a startup that employs stereotyped engineers who easily mix work and play.After a deal in the U. S. for their modem falls through, and Sutherland-Schultz fires Jim Balsillie for insubordination, Balsillie remembers RIM's project and offers to provide administrative and sales leadership for a piece of the company and serve as co-CEO. They make a deal. ""Blackberry"" then follows the crises and inspirations that see the Blackberry become wildly successful through Balsillie's salesmanship and Lazaridis's engineering genius. The sudden fall of RIM happens when Apple invades the market, Balsillie gets distracted by efforts to buy an NHL team, and RIM's hiring practices come under legal scrutiny.""Blackberry"" has the feel of a low-budget arthouse film. It's funny until it's not. Balsillie and Lazaridis agree early on not to lie to each other. Their relationship works great while Balsillie brazens his way to tremendous success and Lazaridis gains more polish. Unfortunately, the company collapses when the lying and avoidance begin, and Lazaridis's commitment to perfection ebbs as competition mounts. Of course, since ""Blackberry"" is fictional, it's hard to say how many personal characterizations in the film are accurate, though the story's arc follows historical events. People in Kitchener-Waterloo will be fascinated by the story but will note that it omits the generosity of both the Lazaridis and Balsillie families to the local community.Howerton and Baruchel are excellent in their roles; Johnson seems a stereotype. The evil American entrepreneurs also seem a bit stereotyped.~steiner-sam rated 8/10 on 12 May 2023"," A thoroughly enjoyable film.: The rise and fall of Blackberry, the world's first smartphone, it's journey from initial conception, to funding, all the way through to its tragic collapse.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it's one I would suggest that has a universal appeal, one many will enjoy, fascinating to think this is where it all started, everything about our phones that we now take for granted.What a fascinating story this is, I'm sure many of us had a blackberry back in the day, I certainly did, it was such a reliable device, it was a game changer, until iPhone that is.It's an intriguing story, with several jaw dropping moments, including the way Jim made his initial impact, then went on and assembled such an incredible work force.A few funny moments, and some very sad scenes too, sewing Mike desperately trying to put something together to compete with Apple was quite tragic, after doing all of the ground work, the tide literally turned overnight.Glenn Howerton gives a show stealing performance as Jim, he's angry, he's short tempered, he wants things done yesterday, he's a high powered, highly motivated executive, dealing with a team who live life to the chill, what a strong performance, that scene where Jim realises that the game is up, fantastic.The whole cast are excellent, Jay Baruchel and Matt Johnson were both great. Seeing Mike change over time, that was skilfully done.I was surprised by how good this was.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 9 October 2023"," Great docufilm.: Aside from the constant annoying fast zoom-ins and shaky cam ""The Office"" style filming - which I can't stand, this was one heck of an enjoyable film. The two hour runtime flew by with the excellent pacing and the smooth cohesive and well-written screenplay. Jay Baruchel nailed his character with an all around great performance, as did Glenn Howerton. For that matter, all casting and performances were spot on, as was the cinematography and score. The story was mind-blowing, even if you never owned a BlackBerry, just to see a slice of Steve Jobs as the Canadian version of a small start-up becoming a world dominating tech empire, and that empire's fall from grace.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 3 June 2023"," One Hell of a Story: Films about the making of a product can either be interesting or dull. In my opinion, there's not a lot of room in between because it was either a good story or not. In the case of Blackberry, I was obviously aware of the phone but never knew the behind-the-scenes stuff. I'm also slightly biased being a Canadian, with this film taking place very close to where I'm from, so if that makes you take this review with a grain of salt, so be it. I absolutely loved it from start to finish and here's why.Blackberry tells the story of Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his genius mind that creates the world's first smartphone, the Blackberry.Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) steps in and buys his way into being the Co-CEO of the company in order to sell the phone. Balsillie is determined to shoot for the moon and nothing else, which in turn may or may not hurt the company overall. If you know the story, you know what I mean, but I won't ruin it. My favourite thing about watching this film though was the fact that I didn't know half of what went down in real life. This was a riveting and engaging lesson of school that I felt like a sat through.Adapted from the novel by Matthew Miller and Matt Johnson (who also did a fantastic job directing this film), the dialogue here was stellar. I was glued to the screen, even when two characters were just sitting in a room and talking. I'm not saying this film is as great as The Social Network, but the story itself is in my opinion. It's a fascinating tale of the dog-eat-dog world that we live in. On top of the fantastic dialogue, Baruchel and Howerton sell these roles and probably each delivers the performances of their careers (especially Howerton).From the editing style that genuinely impressed me to the great direction, performances, and even music choices, Blackberry is a film that I have little to no complaints about. The camera work with all the snap zooms annoyed me a bit, but that's really all I can nitpick. I also give it props for being a Canadian film, made by Canadians, starring some Canadian actors. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that while the story is very interesting, it's also funny when it needs to be. It almost becomes a satire at times and I loved it even more for that. It took the story seriously, but not exactly the movie around it, which worked so well. If you can't tell, I'll be gushing about this one for a while. I highly recommend checking out Blackberry, now playing in theatres.~kjproulx rated 10/10 on 12 May 2023"," The Story of the Worlds First Smartphone: The phone was nicknamed ""Crackberry"" - due to its addictive quality ... (an omen of the future of smartphones). Here, people loved the clicking of the mini keyboard and the blinking ""new messages"" light. It was the rage of Wall Street, Fortune 500 companies government leaders and had dedicated fans ranging from Obama to Katy Perry to Kim Kardashian.It was with this fascination that I watched ""Blackberry"". I wanted to know how did all of this get started and by whom? Well, the movie didn't disappoint - I'd have never guessed the people behind it and wild ride they had.The story is brisk and the characters have radically different personalities. The latter made it interesting given that they all thrown together in an increasingly high-pressure environment. My favorite character was the comic-sidekick Doug Fregin (cofounder) - he reminds me of Jonah Hill. It also turns out that he's the co-writer and director of the film itself.One thing I didn't immediately recognize was that the tech wiz / boy-wonder (Mike Lazaridis) was played by Jay Baruchel. He was the voice behind the lead character in How to Train Your Dragon. It was perfect casting.Blackberry is definitely worth a watch if the subject matter interests you. It's yet another movie demonstrating that real-life events can be just as captivating as pure fiction itself. It joins the ranks of other great tech stories inspired by true events: The Dropout (Theranos / Elizabeth Holmes), We Crashed (WeWork), Super Pumped (Uber), and Tetris (the game).~Vic_max rated 8/10 on 14 May 2023"," In depth story about why Blackberry collapsed: Blackberry (2023)I remember the days when everyone in school was using Blackberries with the cool keyboards and their BBM service. The company was ruling the market and no one could have imagined that one day not only will they lose its leadership position, but it will cease to exist altogether. The general consensus is that Blackberry became obsolete because the company failed to catch up to the smartphones and evolve in a correct way. This film tells a more complete version of the story in terms of what happened behind closed doors and the reason why everything came crashing down.The movie begins in the 90s with a Canadian company named Research in Motion trying to reinvent the mobile phone business. Their two leaders Mike and Doug have a bright vision and the scientific know-how but lack the business acumen to make their idea a reality. During one of their pitches, a man named Jim gets intrigued by their idea and decides to come on board and help get the company off the ground. As the movie progresses, we get to see both the human and the business elements of the story and how closely they come together to both build Blackberry and destroy it.This is clearly a low budget movie but it never feels second rate because of the clean and efficient way in which it tells this large story. The actors and director are rather unknown and because of that, more focus is put towards the narrative and its execution. With that being said, everyone involved puts in the effort to bring drama, humor and tension to their roles. The quick, sharp and witty nature makes it feel like a mix between Social Network and Succession as the film doesn't waste a single minute and ends when it's supposed to. Blackberry might be gone but hopefully this film will shed some light and teach a couple of lessons to those who watch it.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and tv show reviews.~arabnikita rated 8/10 on 14 June 2023"," Best of the Three 1980s Pop Culture Movies: There happen to be three movies out right now telling the story behind a piece of 1980s pop culture. ""Air"" is about the founding of the Air Jordan brand at Nike; ""Tetris"" is about the battle over licensing for one of the most famous games in history; and ""Blackberry"" is about the mega-success and eventual obsoletion of a piece of technology that was undermined by Apple.Of the three, ""Blackberry"" is the best. Sharp writing and direction from Matt Johnson, who also happens to turn in a terrific performance as the moral conscience of the company behind the famous hand-held device, turns this movie into a juicy and intensely entertaining story about corporate ego and competing visions. Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton also give outstanding performances, and the whole thing makes for one of the most entertaining movies I've seen yet this year.And even though I've been using an iPhone for years, nothing has made me appreciate the brilliance of Steve Jobs' invention as much as this movie, which shows why it absolutely blew the Blackberry out of the water.Grade: A.~evanston_dad rated 9/10 on 13 June 2023"," Can biographies be fast-paced? Here's the answer! [+77%]: Between this, Air, and Tetris, I think this one takes the cake. The central performances (Jay Baruchel & Glenn Howerton) are fantastic, and both manage to captivate us with their distinct mannerisms and quirks. The story itself is very compellingly told, with details covered from multiple angles, including business, tech, marketing, employee relations, and more. There's no question that Hollywood loves discussing corporate wins and losses (well, mostly wins) and BlackBerry is certainly among the finest I've seen. Howerton (playing Jim Balsillie) is at his best when he loses his cool, throwing temper tantrums at almost everyone, including contemporaries, executives, and even private jet pilots. The rise and fall of BlackBerry was always going to be an exciting story, and director Matt Johnson does an excellent job with the material in hand.~arungeorge13 rated 8/10 on 4 June 2023"," Flying Too Near The Sun: It's a movie about the quick rise and sudden fall of Research in Motion, the Canadian company which invented the Smart Phone, Told as a sequences of crises, its two main players are Jay Baruchel as Mike Lazaridis, an obsessive-compulsive wimp who actually knows what he is talking about when it comes to building computers, and Glenn Howerton as Jim Balsillie, a loud-mouthed businessman with a degree from Harvard, who recognizes that, and is happy to bs his way through everything. At its peak, the company had a market capitalization of almost $70 billion dollars. Then Steve Job came in and did the same thing in a package that was better designed and offered telephone companies not just user minutes, but data transfer, and it all went away overnight -- according to this movie, anyway.There's no one to root for here, with the engineers, as Michael Ironside, the shouty man brought in to bring some discipline to the company notes, a bunch of children, Howerton thoroughly unlikable, and so forth. Cary Elwes has a sizable role as a smarmy competitor.Like many movies about business, this one is pretty shaky with the facts. Likewise, other than ""don't think you're irreplaceable"" there doesn't seem to be much of a point to this movie. It's largely carried on the noisy performances, with Howerton's increasingly out-of-control Balsillie pretty interesting, if annoying.~boblipton rated 5/10 on 28 May 2023"
Braveheart (1995) - IMDb,8.3,Mel Gibson|Sophie Marceau|Patrick McGoohan|Angus Macfadyen|James Robinson|Sean Lawlor|Sandy Nelson|James Cosmo|Sean McGinley|Alan Tall|Andrew Weir|Gerda Stevenson|Ralph Riach|Mhairi Calvey|Brian Cox|Peter Hanly|Stephen Billington|Barry McGovern,Mel Gibson,Randall Wallace,Scottish warrior William Wallace leads his countrymen in a rebellion to free his homeland from the tyranny of King Edward I of England.," ""Every man dies, not every man really lives."": The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 24 February 2020"," It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time: Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.On this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.Without trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.In addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.This movie is a masterpiece.~heisenberg12 rated 10/10 on 4 August 2019"," A Very Fast 3 hrs: What to say about Braveheart?This movie holds up against the challenge of aging, its exciting, adventurous, funny and passionate.The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible.Is it violent? Sure but what war isn't. I think Mel makes violence as much a part of the story in all his (relevant) films. The characters struggle through great violence and the impacts that is has on them, by not shying away from it we are allowed to get a small appreciation of it and them.The movie isn't OTT but delivers great action that serves the story and entertains the viewer.Its considered a classic film and so it is.~damianphelps rated 10/10 on 21 January 2021"," Your Heart is Free, Have the Courage to Follow It...: A simple message but even today, over seven hundred years later, there are far too many captive to their cultures, governments and institutions. They take a large slice, sometimes all of the freedoms William Wallace and so many others fought for. Keep up the fight because, like the tide, those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema, you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope, although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed, power and control.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 6 September 2020"," You should have courage to make this movie. ⭐: Most of the times Hollywood movies is sided. I don't know what you believe but sadly this movie based on the truth. Only some of the minor subjects are added to make the movie more interesting.

It's actually not only about wars and battles. It has so effective Romance subject. For me the actual subject. Also the movie shows how Freedom is important.Mel Gibson did something special. I don't know is there another movie like this? I'll explain the success I like in this movie. I don't have another example that any movie with great lead actor with achieving so many things. It has James Horner's brilliant scores, (that I don't know how didn't get the Academy Award) has amazing Cinematography, has amazing Costumes and Makeup, also has magnificent Set Decoration.I don't know how Mel Gibson managed to do all these when he's acting superbly.

OUR FREEDOM!~brentcollyer rated 10/10 on 12 March 2021"," One of the best modern movies of time: I'm talking just in the 90's. The 90's were a great time for the movies, we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""Braveheart"" is one of them. ""Braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time, I will watch this movie any day.Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history, anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love, he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""What will you do without freedom?!"", this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles, friends, traitors, and bloodshed, all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father ""They look at him and fight by his side."" He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track, it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie, a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 21 April 2002"," Brutal, But Epic Masterpiece: This is an emotional, involving and ultimately draining film. By the time you are done, you are spent. What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau, Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's ""army"" are fun to watch, too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence, this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fast-forward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the three-hour film, an ""epic"" adventure, if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film, for me, was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to, although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story. Whatever the accuracy, it's a great film and belongs in anyone's collection of epic-adventure masterpieces.The Blu-Ray transfer, by the way, is spectacular.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 25 March 2006"," Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love: I recently revisited Braveheart (1995) on Max. The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom.Directed by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull).Every aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film.In conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love. I would confidently rate it a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 10/10 on 29 October 2023"," Rebel Yell: My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible nobility, in particular the treachery of the future Scottish hero - King, Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since.~Lejink rated 8/10 on 9 November 2023"

It is a mix of exactly the book, and not the book at all. The atmosphere is dark, the action is excellent, I was never bored. It is easy to follow even if you don't know French history, but it is not dumbed down either.The cast (as per real history and the novel) is FANTASTIC. The story is modernised and completely over the top which corresponds totally to the spirit of Dumas, if not to the actual book (it was way over the top for its time as well) .You come out of there like you did as a child after watching a swashbuckling movie with Errol Flynn.My brother cheered loudly like a child, a girl in the audience was crying, all in all, a roaring success in the vein of the very old action movies, but completely modernised with a certain dark steampunk flair.Highly highly recommend. Especially with a good screen and sound which are worth it.~theredmare rated 9/10 on 7 April 2023"," ""He lives with his demons, he tries to drown them in alcohol, but over time they have learned to swim"".: Like a metaphor to this exquisite quote from the movie, a menace from the shadows disrupts the Kingdom of France, in spite of all the efforts to maintain it afloat...The story of The Three Musketeers has been told and retold numerous times, and this movie offers a very nicely balanced blend of tones... You feel the gravitas and heaviness of the situation, while also following our different protagonists that all bring this tasty feeling of adventure and historical fresco ; it is filled with a clever humor, powerful and intense dramatic scenes, dillemas ; espionage, conspiracies and manipulation that punctuate the story and give the film its thickness & richness ; but there also is a cute little romance that brings a sweet levity to the piece.All of this is majestically served by a plethoric cast, the cream of French acting. They all fit their characters perfectly, and every character offers rich layers and fills certain specific archetypes useful each in the part they play for the overarching storyline... There is this greater ""scheme"" and at its heart there is this ""hero journey""...A storyline that's convoluted while being easy to read and process, because well built through the various steps of the evolution of the narrative.The entire piece is beautifully staged (certain action bits might look a lil muddled/shaky here and there, but everything is prettily choreographed all along)... The grain of the image, its texture, the use of light, the textures, and the close-ups ; it all highlights the actors' performance and pleasantly contributes to our immersion into the various intrigues and themes of the story...A last mention and praise to the music score, which is grandiose and perfectly orchestrated ; often epic, silky at times, and simply subtle when needed... Superb composition.Overall, the quality of all the ingredients as well as the final product are excellent, and the great production value is the cherry on top of the cake.A very good movie which won't leave you indifferent and will probably be remembered beautifully.Great work of art.~valmont1702 rated 9/10 on 15 April 2023"," A classic revisited: I need to say before to start the review that i didnt read the book. So i cant really compare both of them. To be honest, i enjoyed it. From what i hear from the director of the movie they took the story, the dialogues as it was in the book but added some stuff and some story that it wasnt in the book. I appreciated it because i still think that if the movie was like the book it will be really boring and uninteresting to see the same thing and add some interest to see it. I enjoyed to see Eva Green, Louis Garrel and Vincent Cassel that i find the performance quite different and interesting to be honest. We see them in other ways that we were used to see them. I enjoyed the story: it have some revelation, surprises, dramatic, love, comedy moments that i really enjoyed and find it interesting to see. It was the part 1 and the end let us want to know what will happen next: about D'Artagnan? Constance(what she saw? And who she saw that we couldnt see?). The fights sequences was quite interesting and the long sequences that we have without a cut reinforced the immersion to live in real time what the characters go trough. I find Eva Green beautiful to be honest and was pretty sensual and good looking on screen. Im waiting for part 2 to see more and im pretty impatient to see that soon.~AvionPrince16 rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," The Fourth Musketeer!: The story revolves around D'Artagnan who joins the Musketeers of the Guard and shows enough bravery when he clashes with the three musketeers - Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who take him under their wing. When Athos is falsely accused of murder, the other trio ensure to save Athos and time, while unraveling the larger conspiracy to harm the King and the Queen as well as instigating wide unrest planned by the baddie Milady and others. How D'Artagnan and three musketeers become a big hurdle to Milady and will they be able to save their King on time forms rest of the story, building up for a sequel.Straight up, this was definitely a good watch and even if the action set pieces mostly with the sword didn't stand out but the story as well as the characters instantly connects. To simply put, the production is top notch. Be with the setting and the costumes, the era is set solidly and the director wastes no time in kickstarting with the action right from the introduction scene of D'Artagnan. It kept throwing enough entertaining scenes throughout, made memorable by the actor especially the multiple duel scene with the trio or even the flirting between the main lead and Constance. It definitely was an easy watch and to keep more of Eva Green to the sequel alone is worth waiting for it.~chand-suhas rated 6/10 on 23 November 2023"," Brilliant and colorful French version based on Alexandre Dumas' classic novel: Again an intrepid young D'Artagnan along with three legendary Musketeers have to fight Milady of Winter and villainous Cardinal Richelieu.

I have been watching various adaptations for years hoping one of them will finally get it right. I was particularly hopeful about this one - I thought if anyone can do it justice it should be the French.For an adaptation of classic novel to be good it must be faithful to the original source material and not make unnecessary alterations to the plot.It must also adequately capture the atmosphere of the time period, the main theme and the essence of the book - which to me was honor, loyalty and friendship.Another very important requirement is proper character development. And for that to truly work the actors should look like the characters as described in the book and be approximately the same age (or at least look that age).In terms of casting - I'd give this adaptation a 3/10.I know Vincent Casel is a good actor but he is 57 years old!!! He could have played another character. Why did they cast him as Athos? Athos is supposed to be 27-29 and very handsome (I know this is highly subjective but still).The actor playing Aramis is also 50 when he should be 22-23. He is not attractive or charming either and Aramis is supposed to be the best looking one of the bunch (at least most other adaptations get this right).For some reason everyone loves Eva Green - she maybe great in other movies but I don't like her as Milady at all. Milady is supposed to be intoxicatingly beautiful and blonde. This actress has jet black hair and is rather plain looking. I have no idea why the director made her smoke a pipe - this just makes her look like a cartoon villain.They also made Porthos bisexual. Think of that what you will - I personally find if ridiculous.If that wasn't enough to disappoint all hard core fans of the book - the plot has been drastically changed.It's annoying because they have kept some parts very close to the book and created this illusion of authenticity. The cinematography is cool looking and the setting has a realistic feel. I like that it is not a slapstick comedy like some of the other adaptation attempts. That being said - the camera angles are a bit weird. They put you in the middle of the duels so you can't get a good feel of what's happening. And the editing is very choppy.Overall I don't regret watching this film but I can't say that I liked it.I guess I'll have to wait another 3-5 years until someone attempts to adapt this book again - maybe they will finally get it right.~sofia36 rated 3/10 on 14 April 2023"," European cinema strikes back: Cloak and dagger films are certainly not the hottest trend at the moment, in fact they haven't been for ages. But that doesn't mean that the genre is unappealing, and certainly not this high-quality production. A high budget, an appropriately fantastic set, an authentic look, charismatic actors in the mood to play, a brisk production, likeable or much-hated stereotypes, humour in the right place - all the ingredients are properly mixed here. The interpretation of the novel is very independent, which is certainly the right approach given the abundance of film adaptations already available. And it is European cinema! So support and watch it all, part 2 will follow soon.~xnicofingerx rated 7/10 on 11 October 2023"," First part of the definitive adaptation of Dumas's work: Although The Three Musketeers already has too many adaptations, surprisingly this French production offers something that, unlike previous adaptations, sticks quite closely to the novel in many aspects. It is an excellent film in many technical aspects with a wonderful production. It has a good cast and the script offers a much more detailed plot of The Three Musketeers. Athos accused of a crime he did not commit, the hidden romance between Buckingham and Anne, the Protestants, historical elements of the conflict between France and England and a clue about Milady's past are details that greatly help the dynamics of the plot. It is a classic action and adventure story very well executed and adapted to current times. Like the first adaptations, this film only narrates half of the novel and does so in a spectacular way. Les Trois Mousquetaires: D'Artagnan is perhaps the definitive adaptation of Dumas' work and leaves a very good impression with desire to see the rest of the story in the second part. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.~Elvis-Del-Valle rated 10/10 on 17 November 2023"," I liked it: I have read the book around 20 times, when I was young. And we had very good russian mini series, which really set the par high for me. I have seen all the adaptations done mean while. And I must say, this is one of the best. Yes, there is some new storylines, but all-in-all it is the same story and the camera angles and designer work is something to be reckon in Oscars gala.It is always different movie experience, when You know the story and specially this one, which is done so many times. And very hard to compaire the characters and actors in it. I would say we have seen many powerfull Miladys in time, but Eva Green is one of the best for sure.~rainer24 rated 10/10 on 6 April 2023"," A bit of a let down: A disappointing movie. Like some others here, I was looking forward to a film which finally does justice to the source material - one of the greatest swashbuckling tales of all time. This, alas, doesn't. There are some very good things. The feel is very authentic. Some of the set pieces eg. The Buckingham ball, the marriage of the King's brother, are stunning. Some of France's best acting talent is on display although I think Cassel and Duris are miscast. They don't do it for me. Matters aren't helped by some of the worst subtitles I've ever seen. Really bad. In summary, worth a watch but nowhere near as exciting as it should have been. It seems we have another part to come. Perhaps they'll hit their stride in that one.~dowanhill rated 6/10 on 31 July 2023"
Amsterdam (2022) - IMDb,6.1,Christian Bale|Margot Robbie|John David Washington|Alessandro Nivola|Andrea Riseborough|Anya Taylor-Joy|Chris Rock|Matthias Schoenaerts|Michael Shannon|Mike Myers|Taylor Swift|Timothy Olyphant|Zoe Saldana|Rami Malek|Robert De Niro|Mel Fair|Vaughn Page|Bonnie Hellman,David O. Russell,David O. Russell,"In the 1930s, three friends witness a murder, are framed for it, and uncover one of the most outrageous plots in American history.", A conundrum: I could not decide if I liked this movie as I was watching it. I knew it was unique with fully loaded star power and great performances but the pacing and story had me scratching my head and even bored at times. I kept checking how much longer the movie had (HBOMax) more than a few times but didn't give up on it. I'm glad I stayed with it. It's a 2 1/2 hour movie but when I finally reached the two hour mark all of a sudden the two previous hours I invested paid off. The story came together quickly and had a surprisingly satisfying ending. This movie is definitely not for everyone. It requires a lot of patience and your full attention but I found it a worthwhile endeavor. Much of it is based on real events. A who's who of A-list actors throughout giving solid performances. Critics panned this movie unfairly in my opinion. What Director Russell created was no easy task. Beautifully filmed with many memorable scenes. I would definitely recommend watching it.~killercola rated 8/10 on 19 December 2022," Amsterdam's uneven pacing and erratic story mishandled its amazing potential and left me wondering when it would finally end.: Amsterdam comes roaring out of the gate with a fast-paced, quirky, charming, and unique mystery of the likes of Sherlock Holmes or Knives Out. The list of celebrities and actors continues to grow as almost every face in this movie is another a-lister making an entertaining appearance. I was so excited to see what happened next and was surprised when the story suddenly screeched to a halt for a very long slow flashback that didn't offer much to the plot. I hoped the exciting pace would return when the story returned to its original narrative, but the risk and urgency had been replaced by a scattered collection of arbitrary dialogue and scenes that lingered much longer than needed. The pacing lagged almost an hour before ramping back up in the final act. Amsterdam had so much potential but floundered in its attempts to be different and unique. The film's best part was Michael Shannon and Mike Myers' quirky bird-loving spies. Every time they were on the screen, I couldn't help but laugh. Christian Bale logged another amazing performance, as expected. But even with entertaining characters, great performances, and an exciting opening and conclusion, Amsterdam fumbled all its fantastic elements and ended up making my eyes heavy and my heart yearn to go to bed early.~Paragon240 rated 6/10 on 6 October 2022"," That is the way it was in the post-war 1930s.: This movie is a bit long at over 2 hours but is written, acted, and directed in a style that is interesting all the way. There is quirkiness, sometimes it reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies, like ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The character played by Christian Bale, a disheveled doctor who lost an eye in the war, reminded us of Peter Faulk's 1970s TV series Columbo in his mannerisms and his quest to find out facts.While this is almost entirely a fictional story it is loosely based on something that was called ""The Business Plot."" Roosevelt was newly elected and a group of businessmen didn't like the direction things were headed. So they hatched a plan to overthrow the President.But very little of the running time is actually devoted to that, most of it has the three main characters, accused of murdering a woman by pushing her into the street to be run over by a delivery truck, working to prove their innocence and to focus in on the real bad actors.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library, a totally interesting and entertaining take on the times.~TxMike rated NA on 27 January 2023"," What a great cast, what a weird yet important film: I saw the trailer for this at a CMX theater and decided the trailer was weird enough to make me see this film. At its start, I pegged it for a comedy in the way Taylor Swift's character, Liz Meekins, was killed, coupled with Christian Bale's glass eye popping out. Although my wife gave me a sidewise look when I laughed.But about a third of the through, the plot line became serious, and the focused changed to watching a plot unfold that would have assassinated FDR to allow American businessmen to deal with Adolph Hitler and Mussolini so they might enrich themselves.The cast of this film is excellent with the three principles-Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington-turning in excellent performances, especially Christian Bale who becomes Burt Berendsen.Regardless of the great acting, I believe the audience lost attention as they became lost in the unexplained plot curve. Even at the end as the credits begin to roll and you see and hear Robert De Niro (General Gil Dillenbeck) juxtaposed against the actual general whose testimony exposed the traitors, Marine Corps General Smedley Butler, speaking the same words, the audience is just left confused and upset.The film's message is just as important today as it was 1934; but the history it's based upon just isn't known, and I am not sure anyone knew what they were watching. Perhaps if a company is going to make a major film based on a basically unknown piece of history, they need to inform the audience ahead of time.I hope this film becomes a classic not only for the acting team assembled here; I don't want to forget Rami Malek, Zoe Saldana, Mike Myers, Henry Norcross, Chris Rock, and others who did such great work, but because one message is one we can't afford to ignore: Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.~pensman rated 9/10 on 21 December 2022"," Surprisingly Powerful and Perfectly Relevant Film: I want to begin by saying that I know this movie only appeals to a certain demographic, but I am that person.Some people will be drawn to a big budget 1930s gangster comedy with famous actors... yet will not be able to follow the numerous subplots and themes of the story due to their lack of interest, intelligence or education. Others will deeply appreciate the overall message but get annoyed by the over-the-top stylistic choices. Then of course there will be those who hate Amsterdam for, ah, political reasons.For me personally, Amsterdam was a revelation. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and I am grateful for the hope and inspiration that the filmmakers and cast were attempting to convey at this moment in history.Amsterdam is on the surface a fictionalized retelling of an historical American crime, spanning marvelously through epic sets and costumes from WWI Europe to 1930s New York City. But the movie is so much more than that. To be perfectly truthful, I do see hints of Moulin Rouge in this film, if Moulin Rouge had been about current political events (though Moulin Rouge was socially relevant at its release date because of the connecting themes of the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries).I truly loved this film, and any flaws I noticed are minor, like one of Margot Robbie's costumes seemed anachronistic to me but otherwise I have nothing but good things to say about Amsterdam.~thalassafischer rated 10/10 on 16 December 2022"," A train wreck: I had some hopes for Amsterdam. It sounded unique, edgy and boasted a well known cast. But I was very disappointed. Amsterdam is a train wreck of a film. It never really takes off. It is poorly put together. The pacing is bad and it has no logical sequence to it. It is a chore to watch this film as it is ridiculously long and for the most part barely covers any ground. There is difficulty to piece together what on earth is going on. I feel there might have been a good story here but it was so badly told and adapted that it falls absolutely flat.The worst film I have seen in 2023. I am so glad I did not waste money watching this in the cinema. I am sad however for the time that got wasted watching this disaster of a film.~Kingslaay rated 5/10 on 7 February 2023"," The Dream repeats itself because it forgets itself: The film opens in NYC 1933. Burt Berendsen (Christian Bale) is a Park Avenue doctor who administers pain killers to veterans and experiments with medicines. He is summoned to a funeral parlor by his lawyer war buddy Harold Woodman (John David Washington). General Meekins (Ed Begley Jr. ) has passed away and his daughter (Taylor Swift) suspects foul play and wants an autopsy. They abscond with the body where his assistant Irma (Zoe Saldana) assists. Could be poison. Next a person dies and they are suspected of murder. The film flashes back to 1918 where Burt's in-laws coerce him into joining the military. Here he commands a group of black soldiers where he makes lasting friends. Our two leads wind up in a military hospital where they befriend Nurse Valerie (Margot Robbie) and they all go to Amsterdam and be free. Burt returns to his wife which then takes us back to 1933.There is still plenty of film left as they try to solve some murders as we are introduced to more Hollywood stars in minor roles. The production is historical fiction and is based on the plot to overthrow the government in 1933. Robert De Niro plays a general who was supposed to be General Smedley Butler who exposed this group before they had a chance to breech the Capitol and place a man in office who was not elected. They had planned on mobilizing our own veterans against the government.You can see the parallels to modern times as one of the themes as we go from WWI to WWII is how history repeats itself.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Margot Robbie once again plays a quirky character.~nogodnomasters rated 8/10 on 13 December 2022"," This is a gem that's intricate and has a worthwhile premis: Amsterdam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of friends who met during World War I and had the best times of their life together in Amsterdam. When one friend breaks the trinity to return home to his wife and start practicing as a doctor it send two of the three into a dark spiral that may separate them forever. The two gentlemen friends work together to make ends meet but find themselves caught in an awkward coverup they're blamed for. Their only hope to clear their names and uncover who is responsible may be for the trilogy to reunite...but how?This movie is directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings) and stars Christian Bale (The Fighter), Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), John David Washington (Tenet), Chris Rock (CB4), Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch), Michael Shannon (The Man of Steel), Mike Myers (Austin Powers) and Robert De Niro (Goodfellas).This is a well put together and methodical film. The storyline is intricate with great twists and turns and fantastic sub plots around the medicines at the time, the way African Americans were treated, the way veterans were helped when they returned home from wars and the importance of friendship. The cast in this is absolutely amazing. It's almost impossible to not get excited about every character. The era is perfectly depicted in every way from attire, props, sets, circumstances and backstories. There are some scenes that drag but when you get to the ending it's worth it.Overall, this is a gem that's intricate and has a worthwhile premise. I would score this a solid 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 8/10 on 14 October 2022"," WAY too many movies all thrown into one: A quirky genre-bending caper with a political bent seems right up David O. Russell's alley. Unfortunately, this movie just never gels. At all. It feels like 10 different movies with 10 different casts, even if those casts are flat out jaw-dropping. I enjoyed some of those movies more than others (e.g. The farcical scenes when Russell pretended to be Wes Anderson), but every time I started getting interested in a plot or enjoying a performance, the whole thing swerved. And more often than not it served right off the road.Also, was Bale doing a Peter Falk impersonation? I kept waiting for him to light a cigar and say, ""Just one more thing...""~cliftonofun rated 5/10 on 4 March 2023"," SEVERELY UNDERRATED...EXPOSES LITTLE-KNOWN HISTORICAL COUP-ATTEMPT BY BUSINESS LEADERS...DELIBERATELY FORGOTTEN: Extremely Prescient Considering Recent Political Events in America.Writer-Director David O.
