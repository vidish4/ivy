It starts of quite well but the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. Any apocalypse movie can be interesting in the beginning - when neither the audience nor the characters know what's going on. The difficult part is to make the reasons for the apocalypse make sense and to make the rest of the movie interesting.The premise is interesting, but as soon as the characters start to put the pieces together, the movie ends abruptly. It is one of the weirdest endings I've ever seen. The characters had only solved about 80% of the mystery and it would be interesting to know what would happen next.This whole movie feels like an intro. It feels like a pilot episode of a TV-show. Perhaps they forgot to film the rest of the movie? But I also don't think there was much more to build with after the credits rolled. Still, an enjoyable movie with a great cast - Mahershala Ali was phenomenal.~lovemichaeljordan rated 5/10 on 8 December 2023"," The ending.......AAARRGGHHHHH!!!: I can enjoy slow character-driven movies.....as long as there is a payoff for the slowness.This movie is similar to M. Night original movies, where you as the viewer do not know anymore then the characters in the story. That was nice and refreshing. There were purposeful plot devices that kept you guessing on what was real or not. Again, pretty good so far. Several scenes could have used some editing and easily cut out 40+ minutes of filler, but still okay as long as you have a payoff.Problem is, there is no payoff. So instead of enjoying a slow build, instead you feel as if the movie wasted your time. If the movie had a ending, I could have enjoyed it, but it didn't. The movie credits starts running and you are left with 'WTF?'. Lazy, this is one of those directors have has a good idea, but not sure how to end their project, so they leave it open-ended under the guise of 'audience interpretation'. Dumb.Other things to note, none of the characters are likeable. The young girl is as stupid and mentally challenged as the 'Hereditary' girl, someone who should be watched 24/7 but the parents thinks it is okay to let them go out alone.~Otte1 rated 4/10 on 10 December 2023"," The ending is the point: I read other reviews that didn't like the ending or didn't see the point. Many of us are just fine if we have our screens on and can see our favorite TV show. We can block out the rest of the world no matter what is happening. We watch our own channels on our own devices. The daughter, Rose, in ""Leave the World Behind"" was perfectly happy leaving her family as long as she could watch her TV shows. With a treasure of DVDs at her disposal that included her favorite show ""Friends"", Rose was more than happy to live forever in isolation forgetting about the outside world. When Rose's brother asked her ""Why do you care so much about that show anyway?"", she said, ""They make me happy."" I thought the movie was right on point showing us where our culture was heading.There are people who can't handle the isolation and need the human contact. There are also people who get debilitated by worrying about what is happening in the world. I know a few people who can't function because they need to check the news 24/7. I would say most people are the opposite. I think I'm in that opposite boat. If I'm honest with myself, I care about what happens in the world, but I am more than happy when I find a good Netflix show instead of worrying about it. I would much rather watch my Netflix show than get involved in politics. That's sad, but true.The one thing I didn't quite understand was what the animals were trying to tell the family. I don't think the animals were telling them to go to the house with the bunker, so I was confused about that part. I understood that the hack was throwing off the migration patterns, but they also said the animals were trying to tell them something. We walk around our neighborhood every night, and we regularly see deer in the front yards. One night last week there were four large deer close to the sidewalk. I kept walking and I wasn't worried much they would charge me! But it got unsettling when they were several large deer up close. I can only imagine if there was an entire herd like in the movie.I think the movie was timely. COVID accelerated our isolation with everyone living in their own realities of happiness. I recommend watching this movie and thinking about how our world is rapidly changing. How many of us would be perfectly happy living in our bunkers of our own making with our own devices watching our own shows not needing to pay attention to the outside world? The movie takes it to the extreme with bombs dropping right outside, but I thought the point was powerful. My biggest concern today was whether the Bengals would win Saturday and when the next Reacher episode will drop on Amazon Prime. I tuned out what Trump and Biden were up to today and what was happening in Israel and the rest of the world.~Tron79 rated 8/10 on 19 December 2023"," a boring crap fear of half baked ideas: So long yet nothing happens.So tense yet90% of the tension comes from bizarre camera angles and strange soundtrack choices in a vain effort to distract you from the fact that this movie doing nothing.Boring.

But unfortunately that didn't come to pass. And unfortunately the ending didn't make up for the thin soup we were asked to digest for the previous hour and a half.I can't even say the acting was terrific, because it just seemed so . . . Adequate. And the direction was off and on, with some really good moments but way too many closeups of faces just wordlessly. . . Looking.Bless them all for trying but it just didn't hold my attention. Although I hung in there until what I hoped would be a revelatory and redeeming ending. But alas, no.~DJWinston rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," What?: What in the ever lovin F$!& was this movie all about? I was actually pretty intrigued. This was some sort of apocalyptic alien. Invasion type of thriller. And I was pleasantly surprised that the family that is typical in these movies was not some sort of whiny, spoiled brat, dysfunctional group. Mom tempted me at times two rethink that, but she eventually grew on me by the end. But after 3/4 of the way through, there was absolutely no advancement of the plot. You can chalk this up to some creative license or someone trying to be funny about not really telling the full story but damn, this just ended with absolutely nothing to go on. None of the characters arcs were fulfilled. Like Period. Who the hell wants to spend two hours watching a movie that has no ending!?~kcrateau rated 3/10 on 9 December 2023"," It was almost good...: Almost. The storyline was interesting. That's what had me intrigued. Especially with the cast! I mean, you can't go wrong with Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, and Kevin Bacon!!Except, you can. You can go way wrong with such an exceptional cast. I'll say this much, because again, I don't like to tell the whole movie, it'll have you waiting for something to happen. I waited for 2 hours for something as small as an explanation or a hint of what's going on here.The scenes changed without a clue as to what you just watched. I even thought the herd of 100 deer would at least give me some insight but no. Nothing. It was even a part where the buck emerged from the group, looking like he was ready to explain what's going on, but to my dismay, nothing.The ending was worse. It just ended. Wham bam, thank you ma'am. Left me with more questions than your average 5 year old in a museum. Since I can't get those 2 hours back, I'll give you 2 minutes of my time. Avoid this movie like the Plague, no, like we did Covid in 2020. You've been warned.~moniquerich rated 5/10 on 30 November 2023"," A Sleepfest Filled with Plot Holes: Don't believe the hype. This is a poor excuse for a movie. Vapid, slow, filled with false drama and poor exposition.Plus the absolutely worst musical track I have ever heard.The movie is clearly directed by a dude who thinks he knows how to manipulate people's feelings but he doesn't.He's created a movie that longs forbetter writing and directing.Oh, the acting is OK but the actions arent. They are unbelievable. The only people who think others behave this way are those who live in the echo chamber and have zero grasp on real life.And that brings me to the final point. The entire film has plot holes like a swiss cheese the size of Ethiopia.I was bored out of my mind and feel that this movie was a bit of an insult to my intelligence.~arfdawg-1 rated 2/10 on 9 December 2023"," All you can wish for as a premise but left you stranded: Three 1980s icon stars.

The son claimed to be stung by a bug and his teeth fall out, no explanation. They go to the neigbour for meds although they have no clue if the meds will somehow cure him and then they have a flashback from 2 seconds before...its a mess.

I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans? Sure, but it dilutes its own suspense on the way to saying little about it.~chiltonsjillfreeport rated 3/10 on 10 December 2023"
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) - IMDb,7.8,Leonardo DiCaprio|Robert De Niro|Lily Gladstone|Jesse Plemons|Tantoo Cardinal|John Lithgow|Brendan Fraser|Cara Jade Myers|Janae Collins|Jillian Dion|Jason Isbell|William Belleau|Louis Cancelmi|Scott Shepherd|Everett Waller|Talee Redcorn|Yancey Red Corn|Tatanka Means,Martin Scorsese,Eric Roth|Martin Scorsese|David Grann,"When oil is discovered in 1920s Oklahoma under Osage Nation land, the Osage people are murdered one by one - until the FBI steps in to unravel the mystery."," Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast: ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.~MrDHWong rated 9/10 on 19 October 2023"," Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...: The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !~imseeg rated 5/10 on 21 October 2023"," Could have been told in 2 hours: Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)While watching the Irishman, I remember feeling guilty about pausing to check how much time was left. This time, I was scared to look at the watch because I never leave the cinema without finishing a. Movie. I know it's Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors who made phenomenal movies like Taxi Driver, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed, but honestly, Scorsese shmorsese for making this one 2 hours longer than it had to be.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves. It's a nice story that could have been an 8/10 as it explores the topics of greed, colonisation and cultural erasure without any consequences. It also came out at a perfect time considering the current events, but did it have to be sooooo damn loooong?Knowing the title of the film, you automatically know it's ending so that alone saps out all the mystery. For what is supposed to be a sad story, the film doesn't create any emotional weight to make us care for it's characters and as a result, it's hard to connect with anything. De Niro and Fraser did a fine job but DiCaprio looked like a pitiful aging boar instead of the young, sly and seductive fox he was meant to be.The costumes and decorations were great but it's like they forgot about the audience while making this film. The story repeats the same trope again and again creating zero tension for us to be invested in until the final 30 minutes. Moreover, it's as if the whole cast, was injected with ketamine as they looked and sounded lethargic adding more weight to the dragging pace.If Scorsese wanted to make an impact then he should've used emotions and tension instead of 600 pauses, glances and empty conversations. He was trying to say a lot in the epilogue about tragedy being hidden behind entertainment and profit but by the time the epilogue finally came, I was happy to go home instead of being floored by the sadness. It's an important story that sadly didn't work out as an impactful drama.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.~arabnikita rated 4/10 on 21 October 2023"," Killers Of The Audience's Bladders: Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.~boblipton rated 7/10 on 22 October 2023"," Extremely Long & Incredibly Morose: Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 5/10 on 18 November 2023"," Killers of my patience: Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.~Med-Jasta rated 4/10 on 22 October 2023"," Coyote want money: Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 9/10 on 18 October 2023"," Somewhere in the middle for me: I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.~petervd rated 7/10 on 29 October 2023"," Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese: Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.~fredrikgunerius rated 4/10 on 15 November 2023"," Not the masterpiece that was hyped: Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.~Truedutch rated 7/10 on 19 October 2023"

The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Not sure what people are watching: I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad. I'll start with the few positives. It's mostly well-made from a technical perspective. I loved the scenes of carnage and chaos. And all of the kills made my jaw drop. It doesn't hold back.Everything outside of the kill scenes is bad. I wish they leaned more into the dark fun slasher vibes. Instead they try to be serious, which magnifies how bad, bland and dumb the rest of the movie is. And while the mystery is intriguing and unpredictable, the reveal isn't even a tiny bit satisfying.This will probably be more enjoyable if you haven't seen many movies. (1 viewing, 12/19/2023)~FeastMode rated 3/10 on 20 December 2023"," I never envisioned this film being so good: We actually got it. It took a long time but we finally got a 'Thanksgiving' movie based on the infamous 'Grindhouse' trailer from 2007. I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Bad: At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good. There is a solid horror movie in there somewhere but that movie is not written, directed and produced by Eli Roth.~Smarmelade rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Super Fun: There were so many opportunities for this movie to go wrong. There is nothing better than a painfully stupid concept well executed to the point that it is actually good. Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it.~tkdlifemagazine rated 7/10 on 19 November 2023"," The Year's Biggest Turkey: Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting. It isn't.I suppose I've only myself to blame for watching it. Clearly, I should've remembered Bob Newhart's words: ""See, Walt, that's an *American* holiday.""Thanks to a membership card, I saw this for free - and I still feel ripped off.~Lomax343 rated 2/10 on 18 November 2023"," I'm at a loss: I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes. I love cheesy horror movies, but this doesn't even count as one. I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.~Gith13 rated 2/10 on 2 December 2023"," There's something wrong about this one: Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.~kuner-59029 rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023", It's like Halloween is still going on.: Eli Roth is a genius! This is some of Roth's best work. The social commentary on Black Friday was well played and Thanksgiving has some of the best gory kills I ever seen. I was bursting out of my seat watching some people get killed and other deaths I felt bad for even though they were not great people. It's just that no one deserved to die the way Roth had some of these folks taken out.Plus it was witty. Thanksgiving took some stabs (pun intended) at itself and it was funny.Defiantly a worth wild horror flick. Felt like I been waiting 16 years for it sense that trailer in Grindhouse and it did not disappoint.~subxerogravity rated 8/10 on 19 November 2023," Mind numbingly STUPID: Look, I love slashers. Despite their low numbers they are my favorite subgenre of horror. I don't ask for much, a coherent story and a surprising villain. However - I draw the line at being insulted. I don't even know how this film got the funding - it is just an insult to audiences. The gore, great, and sure there are some laughs. However the story is beyond stupid, and fine I could forget that if the film was fun like ""Freaky"". However, the cast are awful, 30 year olds mascarading as high schoolers? Ok, I'll get over it. A killer who simply can't be the killer cause you just showed them in TWO places at once? I draw the line. It's insulting, and it made me so mad. All it took was a small rewrite to make something timeless. Instead an absolutely horrible film. So disappointing.

But when one of the guests is murdered, it is up to the former detective to once again uncover the killer."," A good adaptation of a tricky book.: Poirot, now retired, and living in exile, is convinced by his friend Ariadne Oliver, to look into the honesty and integrity of a medium, who's set to visit bereaved mother Rowena Drake.If you're going into this one hoping for authenticity, you may be a little disappointed, I recently read the book, and aside from a few names and events, it is only very loosely based on the book.Authenticity to one side, I really did enjoy this movie, talk about an interesting choice, you can understand why Death on The Nile and Orient Express were chosen, but Halloween Party doesn't exactly lend itself well to an adaptation, but overall it works very well, plenty of plus points.The main winner, the visuals, with Venice they were never going to fail I guess, it looks sensational, but the camera angles and focuses are really nice, very atmospheric and suitably sinister, a shame a few scenes couldn't have been just a tad brighter. The masks, robes and costumes looked so good, they really did give it a Halloween vibe.I'd say this is Brannagh's most accomplished turn as Poirot so far, the toned down moustache has definitely made a difference, he feels more like Poirot.Well acted all round, Kelly Reilly is no stranger to Agatha Christie, she's excellent as Rowena, and as for the young man that played Leopold, he was great.My one gripe, Ariadne, I'm not knocking Tina Fey, she did a good job, but when you read the books, I just don't see her as an American glamour puss, I wonder if we'll see her again.I'm awarding an extra point for the fact that Branagh chose Halloween Party, and didn't opt for Evil under The Sun or Appointment with Death, but I wouldn't be surprised if one of those was number four.It worked well, 8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 15 September 2023"," A Haunting In Venice: Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has retired and is living in Venice where he is visited by his old friend Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey) who asks him to come to a seance held in a palatial Venetian house by top medium played by Michelle Yeoh who is seeking to speak with the spirit of a girl who apparently killed herself jumping from the building. Oliver wants Poirot to expose Yeoh as a fraud or start believing in the afterlife. He attends and there is a murder.Branagh's third go at a Poirot story and depending on your fondness for these things, potentially the best. It is very different from the previous 2 mysteries in that whilst the usual interviews and ripping up of alibis takes place, there is a very distinct supernatural element here, which may or may not be real. What Branagh does though is use this to create a much darker and decidedly well crafted spooky story (he should definitely make a straight ghost story) which is looking both for a murderer and proof that the ghostly bit is true or false. So whilst the gloss and usual extravagant beautifully dressed characters might be missing there is still a great mystery to enjoy. I hope he does another one.~henry8-3 rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Best of the three: A Haunting in Venice is the best of Kenneth Branagh's trilogy of Poirot adventures. This one being a smaller scale whodunit with a supernatural edge fixes any remaining issues whilst still being an engaging mystery with a satisfying answer to whodunit.Kenneth Branagh is still endlessly entertaining as Hercule Poirot, the humour is toned down here due to the darker story and yet again he's grown as a character by the end. Each one has tested something different, first it was his morality then his humanity and here it's his sanity that is pushed to breaking point.The cast is still undeniably star studded but still smaller than the predecessor which means no one goes unnoticed. Highlights include Tina Fey who makes for a great double act with Branagh's Poirot and Michelle Yeoh, given her best role in a Western film in ages (excluding EEAAO of course).Mostly being confined to one smaller, interior heavy location, Branagh's direction is even better that what's come before. His trademark canted angles have never been more at home and even though the film isn't massively scary, Branagh is still able to craft some effectively uncomfortable moments.Thanks to the location this franchise is finally free of the distracting CG that's been its biggest flaw. Being majority practical just makes the whole thing infinitely more immersive and means the stylish visual composition on display isn't having to make up for shoddy effects.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," SUPER FUN!: Started with some beautiful shots of Venice and instantly I was captured by how beautifully shot this film is.

The film looks authentic and gorgeous, as opposed to its predecessors that were over reliant on unnecessary CGI backgrounds.The story does have some interesting ideas and compelling character interactions, but they unfortunately take a back seat half the time. For the other half, we get a lot of weak attempts at horror and red herring plot points that really do amount to nothing.I don't know what happened with the performances, but half of them are pretty great and the others are...well, awful. The actors clearly didn't agree on what kind of movie they were in, with some thinking it ought to be straight drama and others thinking they should play it corny.Like the previous films, this is a middling whodunnit, with all the rote machinations you expect from the genre, nothing shocking, nothing gripping, but nothing so bad as to tank the experience.It's the definition of mediocre.~benjaminskylerhill rated 5/10 on 15 September 2023"," If You Liked Orient Express and Death on the Nile this won't disappoint: A Haunting in Venice is the third film in the now Poirot trilogy directed and starring Kenneth Branagh. I'm a very casual Poirot viewer. My only exposure to the character is through these films and the British tv series, which I watched long ago and barely remember. As someone who has never read a Poirot novel, I personally liked the previous two films by Branagh, Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. I know many Agatha Christie fans do not, and I can understand why given that these films are not extremely loyal to the source material from what I'm told, especially this film.I haven't read the novel, A Halloween Party, but I'm told the only thing this film has in common with it is that it takes place on Halloween, and that there is a Halloween party in it. The culprit is the same in both, but the motivation and victims are entirely different. I'm guessing Branagh went with a far more obscure Poirot story this time, banking on the fact that not many have read and so they won't notice the many alterations made to it.However, as someone who is only a casual fan, just like with the last two films, I'll be judging this solely as a standalone piece and not an adaptation. From that viewpoint, I think the movie is good. Like with the last two movies, the film looks great, is wonderfully shot. This one evokes a strong haunting, Halloween atmosphere. The acting is good by everyone involved, even the child actors.The film is also significantly shorter than the previous two, though in some ways to the film's detriment. I felt Poirot solved the mystery a bit too quickly. The pacing is a bit rushed at the end, and I'm not entirely convinced of how Poirot comes to the conclusions he does.Despite that, the film is a fun mystery/haunting story. A fun movie to watch, especially around Halloween. I would still say I still like Murder on the Orient Express the most. But I would put this film slightly above Death on the Nile. If you're someone who likes the previous to films in this series, there's no reason not to check this out.~mitchell5954 rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," Dark and brooding ho hum plot: My Review- A Haunting in VeniceMy Rating 6/10I was underwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh's latest interpretation of an Agatha Christie novel this one is based on her 1969 novel Halloween Party .It was written late in the authors life to luke warm reviews one critic Robert Weaver wrote - Halloween Party is a disappointment,but with all her accomplishments is Christie can be forgiven some disappointments Poirot seems weary and so does the book.It was filmed previously in 2010 for television starring my favourite Hercule Poirot David Suchet which I watched only after seeing A Haunting in Venice.I must admit Kenneth Branagh who I like in some roles and not others is my least favourite characterisation of Hercule Poirot.His first effort in 2017 Murder on the Orient Express also underwhelmed me but did exceedingly well at the box office however his last effort in 2022 Death on the Nile flopped and for me also had nothing of the grandeur or appeal of the original film adaptations.All that needs to said about the plot line in this whodunnit is that Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot investigates a murder while attending a Halloween seance at a haunted palazzo in Venice, Italy.I was expecting more from this new original adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Halloween Party that's set in the mysterious and spectacular city of Venice because it's a story I didn't know and I had no preconceived expectations.Spectacular Venice is featured in the start and conclusion of this film but it's mostly set indoors in a gloomy gothic villa that could have been built on any movie set.A Haunting in Venice for me fails in a few aspects primarily because of its dark gothic reworking from Kenneth Branagh. It's probably his best Hercule Poirot performance but for me his interpretation of the novel lacks The Agatha Christie touch of humour, eccentric characters and is trying to be something it's not a gothic horror movie it's not really scary at all just dark and brooding.After I saw this movie I watched the 2010 television movie Hallowe'en Party starring David Suchet my favourite Hercule Poirot that bares no resemblance to A Haunting in Venice . It's not her greatest story but the television version has humour and lightness as well as suspense and the performances are much more impressive in my opinion.There are some interesting actors in the cast of A Haunting in Venice including Michelle Yeoh who dropped out of The action adventure 2024 film The Electric State to star in this movie. Why she chose to do this I'm not sure because her role as the clairvoyant Mrs Reynolds is more a short cameo role as is Jamie Dornan's who plays Dr Ferrier .The main supporting role is Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver a crime writer but she didn't shine for me either. Tina Fey plays a similar role in Only Murders in the Building as Cinda Canning but that role is edgy and funny which she does best .With a much more modest production budget of $60 million than his last Agatha Christie move Death in Venice Kenneth Branagh who also directs this movie in my view features himself as Poirot more at the expense of the ensemble characters which is a mistake in an Agatha Christie movie.~tm-sheehan rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Branagh's best Poirot film yet: I have loved everything about Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot series so far. So to see that his next adaption was going to be a fresh one and be more along the lines of horror - sign me up immediately. And the film lived up to the anticipation. If you don't get goosebumps when Poirot says, ""Tell the police not to worry, Hercule Poirot is on the case"" then you need to check your pulse. What an incredible character.Venice is such a terrific setting for a film. I've loved it (and been haunted by it) ever since seeing 1973's 'Don't Look Now'. The final scene in that movie will haunt me until the day I die. Even though 'A Haunting in Venice' is mostly set inside a closed building, Branagh continues to find ways to remind you just how great this setting is throughout the film.The mystery itself is really well done. I wasn't familiar with the story at all and it certainly stumped me and had me impressed once everything was revealed. The cast, while perhaps not quite as star-packed as the previous two installments, all still do an excellent job and play their roles well.I really enjoyed this film. I have no idea whether Branagh plans to stop at three or keep going, but I promise I will continue to watch them as long as he's involved. He has proven he very much knows what he's doing. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 14 September 2023"," bizarre camerawork: The film is a nonstop parade of extremely wide angle shots done from extremely high or extremely low positions. That and tons of dutch angles. If you get motion sick, avoid this!Usually those kinda camera tricks are used sparingly for a very specific effect. When used constantly, they lose impact and begin to confuse the audience (and make them nauseous!).Then, the script. It's silly and thin. The acting is all around just fine. But the lines and situations are dumb. Branagh can act, but his impression of a Belgian man is... uh... embarrassing.Finally, who is loving this stuff? It deviates incredibly far from Christie's stories, that I can't imagine too many hardcore fans liking this. Plus, when you have a rich history of David Suchet and Joan Hickson turning in fantastic performances as Christie's beloved characters; this one just feels wayyyy off center. No fun.~GSK23 rated 1/10 on 9 November 2023"," Tormenting in Venice...: If you're looking for a film that's clearly frightening, who's lid is very loose and needs some tightening, where the characters are dull, and the glass is less than full, join Poirot, in this grand faux, that's not enlivening. Although if Kenneth and his acting troupe engaged, gave the impression they weren't in it for the wage, I'd like to think it wouldn't stink, that my eyelids would not sink, into a stupor more akin to older age. Poor old Agatha must be spinning in her grave, it's not just the film that needs a little save, but I guess if you're a fan, can endure what others pan, you'll enjoy performances - that disengage.~Xstal rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"

We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting. Not terrible, but not elevating me either....Something else DID disappoint me more though...More bad: I was waiting for SOME surprising and original twist or plot turn, that would make this story stand out from any other crime movie, which unfortunately never came. Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best. Still worth a watch though, but I only would dare recommmend this to the arthouse movie fans of this killer crime genre.~imseeg rated 7/10 on 31 October 2023"," Great looking, but dull as dishwater.: What happens when a hired killer makes a mistake?After a twenty minute introduction, something finally happens, and you're left with a film that's beautifully shot, well acted, with a somewhat interesting story.The trouble is, if this film were a song, it would be something by The Smiths, there's definitely a fan base, but for some of us, it's all just too slow, too dull, and ultimately a depressing affair.The voiceovers become a little irritating after an hour or so, and that constant first person narration slows the film down to a snail's pace.Neo noir style, nice to look at, and I did like Michael Fassbinder's performance, but ultimately I couldn't stop myself from yawning for the full two hours.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 12 November 2023"," Plot-Lovers Will Need To Look Elsewhere: I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. I consider Zodiac, The Social Network, & Fight Club to be amongst my favorite films, and Mindhunter in that same category for TV shows. So, even with The Killer dropping on Netflix, I went to a special theater showing to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way in to this one--mainly because plot-lovers (like me) will largely be a bit lost.For a very basic overview, ""The Killer"" tells the story of the unnamed Killer (Michael Fassbender) hired to perform a rather tedious assassination. When the plan goes a bit awry, however, he must compromise--or at least re-evaluate--some of his principles as he ventures into uncharted emotional territory.The Killer is certainly a clinic in cinematography and choreography, as is the usual Fincher style. Its action set pieces are tension-filled and Fassbender's flat aesthetic is perfect for the lead role. Half the film's dialogue is the Killer's snarky inner monologue, and again Fassbender nails that.The big problem--at least for plot-lovers--here is that there is seemingly very little context or rhyme/reason for what we see transpire. Almost nothing is provided other than what is literally playing out in front of viewers in any given scene. As such, I really struggled to care about anything that was happening--in large part because it quite frankly felt like a series of disconnected interludes as opposed to a whole, coherent story. There were times I even felt bored watching because I knew an extended espionage scene was upcoming and I didn't fully understand the stakes.Seeing as how The Killer is getting relatively high marks, I can assume either one of two things is happening: 1. Audiences are not as hung-up on the lack of discernible plot/motives than I; or 2. There is a deeper message here that I'm just utterly missing. Perhaps the ongoing monologue holds the key--but again, I found that more snarky/sardonic than informative.Perhaps more analysis or a second viewing will crystalize The Killer for me--but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of my first viewing I have to place it near (perhaps at) the bottom of the Fincher canon.~zkonedog rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," Average: Was really looking forward to this movie as i like Michael Fassbender and David Fincher and they never showed it at any cinemas near me during its limited release. Maybe i've just built it up too much in my head but i can't help but be disappointed in it.It has alot of cool style and it as dark as you'd expect from Fincher. Who as you'd imagine, does a good job of directing. But its a very straightforward story and i couldn't help but say ""Would a professional hitman really do that?"" at certain points of it.The constant commentary of the movie won't be for everyone and there's only so much dramatic acting Fassbender can do as a stealthy killer. So all in all. Pretty average.~martinrobertson300482 rated 5/10 on 10 November 2023"," ""If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you."": That's a quote from the opening scene of the movie. I'll give them credit for telling you upfront: you are in for an absolute slog of a movie. It's not hyperbole for me to tell you this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was extremely difficult to get through. I thought about quitting multiple times.To make it worse, the story is ultra basic and fully bland. There is zero intrigue. It failed at making me care about anything or anyone in the movie. There is one really cool fight scene that lasts a couple minutes. Other than that, nothing about this movie stands out.The quality level of filmmaking is far from terrible. But it's swept aside by the sheer boredom that is this movie. I really wish Netflix could figure out how to make movies. I feel like it has to be the writing. Or maybe they just take on scripts that aren't worth making. Way to waste Fassbender.~FeastMode rated 2/10 on 11 November 2023"," Boring movie that's more style over substance: I'm surprised by all the positive reviews here. If you like movies that are stylistic and pretty in theory, but boring and consulates in practice, I guess you'll like this movie. But if you're someone who actually cares about plot, I'd definitely pass.For starters, this movie takes forever to get to the point. It starts off with narration that just continues and continues. If you make it past the dull start, you'll discover an unoriginal plot that's just not interesting enough to justify its unnecessary complexity. There are a few stand out moments, but they're strung together poorly. There's also nothing to get you invested in the characters or their well-being. You're just watching a guy do stuff, and sometimes it's interesting, but a lot of the times it's not.~aprilsfriendorin rated 3/10 on 31 October 2023"," Incredibly slow, predictable and nothing out of the ordinary.: 3.5 ⭐I love Finchers work but this one was a bit off. This film had a typical revenge story with a lackluster ending. Fassbender lead the way only to discover the script limited his potential for a great performance. The whole film was just sitting and waiting for the peak to hit but it never does.Cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. Production was decent but it didnt seem difficult at all given how the film played out. Dont think any awards will be dished out for this one..A watch and forget movie with no lasting impressions from the audience. Probably why Fincher chose Netflix. Its free to watch for a script he pulled from the middle rack.I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone trying to save 2 hours of their night.~jon_hsieh rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," It's...fine?: It's well compiled. The narration got me invested. Shot beautifully, the suspenseful music is excellent. The movie as a whole is...yeah it's fine? It lacks depth and some scenes lack logic as well. It makes for a fun watch nevertheless. Better than most of the stuff going around these days. A one time watch and you never think about it again kind of a watch. Not Fincher's best but not his worst either. Fassbender is decent in his role portrayed as a mysterious killer who has a knack for everything pretty much. Solid punches to the face by a guy twice his size does not faze him at all. That's about it really.~SneakyWasabi rated 6/10 on 10 November 2023"," Yeah, nah.: The Killer simply gives you no reason to be invested in it, rather empty, uneventful and dull for the runtime.It's nothing you haven't seen before either and without substance, considering those involved, though not awful or anything. The soundtrack however is awful, given it isn't satire like ""American Psycho."" The fight scene's like a video game, skill and cunning's hardly overcoming that sort of velocity of power. Take the UFC battle between Frank Mir and Brock Lesnar as a basic example. I mean the sequence's probably still the highlight of the film, I just didn't buy it. All up a pretty pointless film.~bombersflyup rated 3/10 on 11 November 2023"," Empathy is Weakness: The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is a paid assassin. In Paris he misses his mark (Endre Hules) and kills a dominatrix (Monique Ganderton) instead. He now becomes a mark himself. He arrives late at home to discover his girlfriend in a hospital. He goes on a revenge tour.The film consists of Fassbender talking in a monotone in his head. It is boring as he keeps giving himself the same rules and affirmations over and over. There is an element of humor in his various alias based on fictional characters in 1970's TV shows. I caught, Felix Unger, Oscar Madison, Howard Cunningham, Reuben Kincaid, Sam Malone, George Jefferson, Lou Grant, and Robert Hartley (Bob Newhart Show).

Beautiful cinematography. Great score.~andrewchristianjr rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," Not For Everyone: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.~slightlymad22 rated 8/10 on 4 March 2022"," Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.: A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 18 December 2022"," Everything I wanted and more: I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.~jtindahouse rated 10/10 on 2 March 2022"," Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.~TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews rated 9/10 on 5 March 2022"," The Batman Is A Hell Of A Movie: Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.~HabibieHakim123 rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," The try-hard Batman movie: Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!~whatgift rated 5/10 on 7 March 2022"," Overblown, overhyped latest addition to the Batman franchise: STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **~wellthatswhatithinkanyway rated 4/10 on 4 April 2022"," Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.: I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.~jegd-847-631407 rated 4/10 on 5 March 2022"," A good Batman movie: The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Beautiful cinematography. Great score.~andrewchristianjr rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," Not For Everyone: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.~slightlymad22 rated 8/10 on 4 March 2022"," Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.: A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 18 December 2022"," Everything I wanted and more: I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.~jtindahouse rated 10/10 on 2 March 2022"," Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.~TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews rated 9/10 on 5 March 2022"," The Batman Is A Hell Of A Movie: Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.~HabibieHakim123 rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," The try-hard Batman movie: Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!~whatgift rated 5/10 on 7 March 2022"," Overblown, overhyped latest addition to the Batman franchise: STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **~wellthatswhatithinkanyway rated 4/10 on 4 April 2022"," Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.: I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic.

X (2022) - IMDb,6.5,Mia Goth|Jenna Ortega|Brittany Snow|Kid Cudi|Martin Henderson|Owen Campbell|Stephen Ure|James Gaylyn|Simon Prast|Geoff Dolan|Matthew J. Saville|Bryony Skillington,Ti West,Ti West,"In 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives."," Ti West's exploitation mash-up: Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.~gortx rated NA on 31 March 2022"," Nice old-fashioned horror-flick with some hefty gore.: I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).~johannes2000-1 rated 8/10 on 16 March 2022"," What a great disappointment ...: My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment !

Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have.~miles670 rated 7/10 on 15 April 2022"," Nothing new here, but nothing bad either: An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.~aidanratesmovies rated 6/10 on 2 April 2022"," Overhyped. Doesn't live up to A24 other films.: While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.~Horror_Flick_Fanatic rated 5/10 on 20 March 2022"," Rubbish: Don't get the positive reviews, basic acting, boring plot and genuinely pointless, the story was just so dated and predictable.The killsOh go into this basementWhy can't we see the handOh a distractionThree random holes in a wallSo many stupid predictable lazy outcomes. It was just a tragic mess that was slow, dull and lazy.~chris_rowe-881-168820 rated 2/10 on 23 March 2022"," A Fun, Classically Styled Slasher: Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.~cadillac20 rated 8/10 on 18 March 2022"," Fails at every level: After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess.~HorrorEnjoyer rated 1/10 on 26 May 2022"

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's."," A Good Time!: Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't ""scared"" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering ""Can I take my kid to see this?"". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The ""twist"" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think ""Is this a horror film?"". It's not ""balls-to-the-wall"" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.~Liam3011 rated 7/10 on 25 October 2023"," Not as good as I'd hoped, but I still enjoyed it.: A security guard gets a job, and suddenly realises he's going to have an incredibly challenging and difficult night.I genuinely and desperately wanted to love this film, the trailers looked so cool, and despite not being a gamer, I knew of the game.Now, if I were judging this solely on the visuals, I'd be giving it a mammoth score, and healing praise onto it, it does look fantastic, and as for the 'locals,' they look so cool, the special effects are great, genuinely a smashing looking film, one that my fifteen year old self would have loved.Now, the important bit, the translation from game to film, I really wish I could say it worked brilliantly, I'm not sure, I think there's something missing, does the story work? Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 6/10 on 12 November 2023"," Fantastic Visuals, Wafer-Thin Story: So, I know it must be extremely difficult to take a simple gaming concept like Five Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline ""cheese"", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.~tankboy-46851 rated 6/10 on 27 October 2023"," 9/10 for looks - 3/10 for screenplay: If you loved the FNAF games, go see this, at the base level it's fun to see this stuff come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.~Chri-seened-it rated 5/10 on 27 October 2023", Had so much potential!: Five Night at Freddy's was a pretty big letdown. I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.~djrmc24 rated 4/10 on 30 October 2023," Nothing really special: I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole ""kidnapped little brother"" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.~AfricanBro rated 5/10 on 31 October 2023"," Solid fun time: People are overanalyzing this movie as though it's supposed to be a masterclass in acting and screenwriting. It's a ""horror"" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.~PrinceCharmingHere rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," It's for the fans, to have a good time: Listen, this is no cinematographic masterpiece, but it's a good whimsical even sometimes satirical camp movie. I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣~gurday rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," Massive script issues: Just saw Five Nights at Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.~katharine-nichols rated 5/10 on 31 October 2023"," Forgetting the most important thing: Jesus, anyone giving this a ten wants their head checked.Feels like a wasted opportunity to me, because visually speaking, it was a really strong flick. The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative.~rws_20 rated 3/10 on 30 October 2023"

Because this is such a primal story it could be the most powerful and disturbing film of the year. The characters speak in a kind of dead tone, usually on banal matters (like how waterproof a watch is). The music alternates eerie silences with harsh nerve-wracking strings and drums. Shots of surgery and blood churn the stomach. The widescreen settings have an amphitheatrical stretch. Alone among recent films, it sends you out in catharsis — ""calm of mind, all passion spent."" This film releases you, drained. A man's misdeed brings down a curse upon his entire house that only his own immense sacrifice can expiate. That's the Greek tragedy, beside which our mundane stories of simple guilt, rationalization, mercy, forgiveness, and even human justice — the business of cops and courts — dwindle into insignificance. This primitive drama involves a heart surgeon Steven Murphy and his ophthalmologist wife Anna. That is, the elemental force erupts in the seat of modern science, rationalism, humanity. The professional curers are profoundly afflicted. Their reason is helpless, irrelevant, once the old pagan gods have been stirred to ire. Dr Murphy was at least tipsy when his bungled surgery cost a man's life. Murphy has not openly accepted responsibility or expressed his guilt. But he did attend the man's funeral and stop drinking altogether. He also befriended the man's orphaned son Martin, whom he buys gifts and offers friendship as a sop to confronting his own guilt on any deeper level. Now Martin swells from orphaned son into preternatural agent of vengeance. For his father's death has proved a curse on his house too. He and his mother — in different ways — crave Dr Murphy to replace the dead man in their lives: ""My mom's attracted to you. She's got a great body."" This thuggish kid has an other-worldly understanding. He has become the seer, the oracle who alone fathoms the root cause of the Murphy curse and its resolution. If Murphy doesn't kill one of his children, his entire family will die. First they are paralyzed, deprived of appetite and will, then their eyes erupt in Oedipusian bleed, then they die. Of course these modern sophisticates deny this savage myth. Murphy in particular blames Martin for the curse he has only reported. Daughter Kim understands, because she wrote a paper on Iphygenia, Agamemnon's daughter whom he has to sacrifice to atone for having killed a sacred deer. Kim is attracted to Martin and offers herself to him. In him she senses a worldliness apart from the others. Having initially assumed kid brother Bob would go (""Can I have your MP3 when you die?) she then volunteers to be Dr Murphy's sacrifice. She knows the story.The Murphys' life is characterized by a kind of torpor. No-one has any zest for anything. The conversations are banal and wary. Dr Murphy and then Kim report her first period as if it were a head cold. All sense of the primeval has been lost. Anna feigns total anesthesia for her sex with her husband. His friend and anesthesiologist charges Anna a hand job for info. Facing the curse Steven tries coaxing, coercion, threats, even physical violence and the threat of murder, to shake the seer off his vision. Steven turns to a school counsellor for advice on which child to pick. Anna twigs to their predicament: ""Our children are dying, but yes. I can make you mashed potatoes."" She marshals the will to free Martin from her husband's futile abuse. Indeed both the doctor and the anesthesiologist each blame the other for failures in the operating room. This is the modern world with advanced science and culture but with stupefied emotions and a shallow sense of responsibility. Dr Murphy forbids smoking in the house, but his wife and daughter smoke outside. Martin accepts his recent addiction with the same resignation he seems to have accepted as his role of messenger from the gods, to bring Murphy to their harsh justice. This elemental tragedy is the prophet director's harsh judgment on a world that evades its guilt and responsibility by suspending all conscience, all sense of a higher purpose than the mundane and worldly. The modern news cycle allows no time for the eternal.~maurice_yacowar rated 10/10 on 8 November 2017"," Modern take on a Greek myth.: I went into watching this with no background and it is strange from the start, the stilted dialog and unusual responses characters often give. The title threw me until I read later that one version of the Greek myth requires the killing of a sacred deer to get the gods to help.I watched this until the end and was NOT satisfied with its conclusion. A teenager whose dad died on the operating table seems required to take revenge on the doctor's family and that means killing one of them, as they first become paralyzed then their eyes bleed. The only way this could have any reality in today's world is if the teenager has some sort of supernatural powers. And in fact there is a scene where the doctor's wife (Kidman) kisses the bloody feet of the tied-up teenager in their basement, presumably to suggest the biblical story of Jesus' feet being washed by a prostitute.So, while the movie is well-made in most respects, and the actors are good, I did NOT find this movie satisfying. Maybe if I were a fan of Greek mythology it would come across better. I found it very interesting, just not very good.On BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.~TxMike rated NA on 20 September 2020"," Diiiiiiiiistuuuuuurbbbbbiiiing: They have you terrified at what was going to come out of someones mouth in just about every scene.

Should have a warning, ""written by some one with psycological issues""~SeanDTheFilmMaker rated 8/10 on 16 October 2018"," Iphigenia in Aulis: What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen ""The Lobster"" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of ""The Lobster"" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation ""Iphigenia"" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is rather muddled.In the Greek myth, King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, at the behest of the goddess Artemis to allow him and his troops to proceed on the warpath to fight the Trojans. In some versions, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, hence the title of this movie. The reason I don't think the effects work as well here as they did in ""The Lobster"" is because whereas that movie took human shortcomings to absurd extremes, this one takes what was already by modern standards an absurd myth and attempts to make it modern and more ordinary. Gods are dead and replaced by doctors, and if there is a god, apparently, he's a pockmarked teenager seeking revenge for his dead father. I suppose a surgeon's wife role playing during sex as a patient under general anesthesia and a father recalling to his son the time he masturbated his father is more in line with some of the sexual perversity one finds in some Classical Greek literature, though. Yet, overall, it comes across as disjointed. If this were supposed to be a psychological thriller, it seems difficult to lure the spectator in without being able to identify with the characters--whereas this was unnecessary in the black comedy of ""The Lobster"" (and contradictory to the intent of the Greek movies). But, the stilted acting and illogical premise of the narrative works against identification. I don't think any amount of tense scoring and camera movement from distant perspectives can alleviate that--in a world where nothing is sacred.P.S. I still don't quite get the point of ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) as the film-within-the-film. Is it just because characters in both are prisoners of fate or something? I prefer the self-reflexivity of the director's prior ""Dogtooth"" (2009) and ""Alps"" (2011).~Cineanalyst rated 5/10 on 2 December 2018"," Misunderstood: This is definitely not one for everyone and that's okay, sure, but to assign it a 1-star or 2-star rating as some have done, is just ridiculous, especially when the disconnect certainly is on the side of the viewer. In fact, those who deemed the acting 'bad' (one reviewer notes: ""I thought the characters were robots"") missed the entire point of the film.While, admittedly, the acting from the girl who plays the daughter is flawed, both the acting from the rest of the cast and the way in which the story unfolds is purposefully meant to make you feel highly uncomfortable - and it succeeds.From the very first scene, to where your mind goes in regard to the sexual nature of the relationships, to the inappropriate or generally eyebrow-raising topics of discussion between some of the characters, this film is MEANT to BE ""creepy"" and to make the viewer FEEL odd, off - and even dirty.Much of the creepy-factor, if you will, comes PRECISELY FROM the amazing way in which most of these talented actors made these characters come across as disturbing, unappealing, ALMOST like most of us, ALMOST worth sympathizing with, but not quite. It would have lost much as a film of this nature had the acting been that of a normal or run-of-the-mill family). Again, EVERYTHING, from the topics of conversations, to their postures, to their almost detached delivery, was purposeful and meant to lend to the eeriness of the film and the discomfort of the viewer. THINK about it for a moment: have you ever watched Colin Farrell NOT deliver an enthusiastic, almost convivial performance? The departure from his easy affability in other roles, and almost apathetic delivery in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, was purposeful, and necessary to drive the uncomfortable narrative deep into the viewers minds. This is the very same reason (among many others) one particular character sings - eerily. The viewing experience had to be uncomfortable.While The Killing of a Sacred Deer may not go down as a family favorite or as one we watch over and over, it is definitely engrossing for its running time and more importantly, it isn't the thousands of other films on hundreds of streaming sites with nothing to say for itself. In short, for those who specifically look for and enjoy films which are not the standard fare, this one is a should-watch.7.6/8.~Her-Excellency rated 8/10 on 11 December 2021"," artistic endearvor: Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) have teen daughter Kim and young son Bob. He is befriended by Martin (Barry Keoghan) who is the son of his dead patient. Martin insinuates himself into Steven's family and Kim falls for him. Martin reveals his threatening predictions with a devastating solution.After his interesting weird The Lobster, Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos creates another oddity. His insistence on the mannered monotone dialogue delivery has a hypnotic effect that puts me to sleep. I had to rewind to get back into the flow. Keoghan's dead-eye serial killer performance is too obvious. I can't believe that Steven would bring him into his home. While I appreciate a lot of the outsider oddity flavor, I cannot take any reality from any of the characters or situation. The first thought I have as Steven is that the boy poisoned my family. At a certain point, these are no longer realistic people but rather artistic installations. There is some value in the artwork and I can imagine this story as a shocking psychological thriller in another person's hands.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 3 March 2018"," Weird, Intriguing but Absolutely Disappointing and Overrated: The renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is married with Dr. Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) with two children, the young teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and the boy Bob (Sunny Suljic) that are their pride and joy. He works with the anesthetist Matthew (Bill Camp) and recently he is dedicating attention to the teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan), whose father died in a surgery. Steven brings Martin to meet his family and the teenager invites him to have dinner at his home with his mother (Alicia Silverstone), who harasses Steven. He rejects and on the next day, Bob gets sick without walking. Steven and Anna bring Bob to the hospital and after a complete checkup, the doctors do not find any problem with the boy. Soon Martin meets Steven and tells that he killed his father; now he has to kill Anna or Kim or Bob; otherwise they will all get sick and die. Who is Martin?""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a weird, intriguing but absolutely disappointing and overrated film. The plot and the performances are cold, without heart, and has scenes absolutely unnecessary, like Anna masturbating Matthew in the car or the cameo of Alicia Silverstone. However, the screenplay holds the attention of the viewer that expects the clarification of the mystery. Unfortunatelly the conclusion is awful without any explanation for what is happening or who Martin is or has done. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available~claudio_carvalho rated 3/10 on 15 December 2017"," much more than a psychological thriller: Saying that the ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is just a great psychological thriller is at least undermining... This film is full of brilliant metaphors, but you have to know Greek mythology and history to understand some of them. When Agamemnonas wanted to go to Troy to fight with his ships, there was no wind and he could't get there. So he asked the Gods to throw some strong winds, but the Gods replied that he had to sacrifice something in order to get the winds he desired, so they told him he had to kill his daughter. Agamemnonas thought about it and he decided to kill his daughter, but when he was just about to kill her, the gods transformed her into a deer, so he killed a sacred deer.That's where the title of the movie comes from and you can easily guess the reason..So this film is about choices, sacrifices and revenge.But revenge from the Gods. When Martin can bring sickness and death to Steven's whole family, in fact martin is in the place of a God from Greek mythology. And his duty is to bring the justice and punish those who overestimated their powers and tried to play gods( Steven went to do a surgery drunk)In addition to that, this great film of lanthimos, gives a harsh critic to the modern way of living in the western societies. Alienation, fake goals, fake relations and money that that bring comfort but not happiness.In conclusion it's a great film that gives you much homework to think about when you get home after you watched it and surely much more than just a great psychological thriller that many people believe it to be..~methodman-70252 rated 8/10 on 4 November 2017"," V for Vendetta...: What would you do, if a young man came to you, presented you with options after all you'd put him through, where the choices were insane, but you had to take the blame, a vendetta must be settled, and there's no way to eschew.An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, the justice of the vengeful although I'm not sure it would soothe, but the killing sprees continue in 50 countries and some more, the barbarity of revenge, some still find difficult to abhor.Barry Keoghan is outstanding as the vengeful child seeking recompense for the perceived crime committed by Colin Farrell's character in an imaginatively told tale of retribution you rather hoped had disappeared some time ago but sadly hasn't.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 7 January 2023"," Oddness, on purpose: Yes, this movie is weird, and it's entirely intentional.Yorgos Lanthimos is an interesting Greek director who's been making English language films for a few years.

The Favourite I ended up loving because it was able to most effectively balance its weirdness with its characters (perhaps because he didn't actually write this script as opposed to everything else he's directed).The Killing of A Sacred Deer is the movie he made in between the two listed above, and I think it might be the weakest of the three. Good instead of very good, that is.So, let me talk about the weirdness. Everything about this movie feels stilted and mannered. It's off putting, especially at the beginning when you're trying to figure out what on earth the movie actually is. As the story progresses, though, it's easy to see the nefarious undercurrents running through every scene. We spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out where this unease originates from, and the fact that everyone is delivering unnatural dialogue unnaturally heightens the feeling.I've seen so many complaints of unnatural dialogue over the years. The one example strongest in my mind is around the movie Juno. The complaints of the mannered way in which characters spoke seemed to be a mask for complaints about the rest of the movie that people couldn't figure out how to express, so they picked on the dialogue. I'm not saying that criticism of such writing is invalid or always misdirected, but that did seem to be the trend I noticed and continue to notice in such criticisms. Just because dialogue isn't reflective of how people actually speak (I like to think of Mamet), that doesn't mean that the dialogue is a failure. Oftentimes, it's that way for a reason.Anyway, back to the movie. The sense of unease that permeates the film is great, and I kind of loved the film for about the first three-quarters. However, once the plot began to unravel and resolve, I felt like the movie lost some of its edge. When the main character is presented with his great moral choice (and his blackly comedic method for resolving it), I felt more removed from the choice than I should have. The build up is what works best in this movie, while the resolution just simply doesn't gel as well.Still, the movie's an odd but entertaining little thriller.~davidmvining rated 7/10 on 21 November 2019"

And if this film can make one person think twice about taking advantage of someone who can't defend themself it has done it's job. But it's a lot more than a film that sends a powerful message. It is sinister entertainment at its best. Wonderful.~michael-kerrigan-526-124974 rated 8/10 on 30 May 2021," Refreshingly original, and unpredictable.: Many of the modern vengeance films are brutal and gory; many boasts incredible fight sequences and stunts. 'Promising Young Woman' has neither of these traits. In fact, this is such a different vengeance movie, it is refreshingly original. I suppose in a way once could refer to it as psychological vengeance.Carey Mulligan delivers a fantastic performance as Cassandra, the titular Promising Young Woman. Every week she goes to a club and pretend to be too drunk to stand. Every time a 'nice guy' picks her up, and is ready to take advantage of a drunk woman. Then, at the most awkward moment, these 'nice guys' then find out the girl is not drunk - and she rightfully puts them in their place. The film also serves as a warning to guys who take advantage of drunk women. (Hell, are straight guys really such douce bags???)Seven years ago, Cassandra and her best friend Nina dropped out of med school after a tragic incident. She now works in a coffee shop whilst planning her revenge on the perpetrators. The film takes its time telling us exactly what happened to Nina, and I found this very effective. I enjoyed this mystery element. The entire time I was aware something terrible happened but didn't know what until it was revealed. I rather liked this approach.The love interest comes in the form of pediatrician Ryan (Bo Burnham), who went to med school with Cassandra. Its not your average romance story, and I enjoyed this approach, too. 'Promising Young Woman' is not really a fast-paced movie, but its not slow either - and I was captivated all the way.There are many twists and turns and events I never saw coming. The film does not have the ending I was hoping for, but I'm not going to do spoilers. Let's just say this is a very good and very realistic vengeance movie with a great script, and it most certainly is unpredictable! I do believe women will relate more to the film than men, but either way, this was an entertaining watch. The film also highlighted issues that might make you ponder on afterwards.~paulclaassen rated 7/10 on 27 March 2023"," Dark comedy with a shocking ending: It is a bit slow moving and less exciting than the trailer suggested, but it was a very unique premise for a movie and it was done quite well. The ending was a shock!It was a great move to cast such likable actors in the roles of the predators/rapists, depicting the idea that these kinds of people hide behind their smiles, popularity, and success.It was also interesting to note that no details are elaborated about the sexual assault incidents-implying that we don't need the details to understand that sexual assault is reprehensible across the board, no matter what type.Some people say this is movie was ""anti-man"" because men are primarily antagonists, but clearly they are forgetting the female dean (represents the system), her mother (who is emotionally unavailable and self absorbed), and Alison Brie's character (willfully ignorant). Many different parties were responsible for what happened-men and women-especially when it came to find justice. The protagonist herself was in a questionable gray area too with some of her vigilante actions. Also the lawyer could be considered a redeemed character, the only one really, and he's a man.The ending was unexpected and satisfying in its own way, but definitely shocking and left me reeling for a bit after. Bold move by the creators! I'd recommend this film, it was a good watch.~Bluereviews4you rated 8/10 on 18 January 2021"," Not just one story ... unfortunately: I reckon it is or will be easy to dismiss what happens here for some. Unfortunately that does not make the things that are depict in here untrue. From a male perspective you may see different valid points throughout this ... you may feel that certain things do not apply to you. And maybe they don't - that doesn't mean that they don't exist. I know it feels like I'm repeating myself ... something the movie does avoid.Which is quite the feat, considering what it is about and how she goes on a hunt (prowl?) at nights ... I was not sure what she was doing and the movie did leave it upon a bit ... but it does clear up during the runtime. Now she is broken and we slowly get why that is. It is revealed in the right way, even while we do sort of know or feel that we know most of it.What is a nice touch, we never see anything in that regard. There is no sleaze, there is no (visible) exploitation going on. That does not mean it is easy to watch ... or listen to what is happening. I personally am not a fan of the term feminist, but this movie may change your mind regarding that or other things.There are borderline things happening and our main character is not perfect. That does not mean she does not deserve something good ... and it does look like she can have. If she can bring herself to let go ... on the other hand, there is more than meets the eye. Way more ... and the ending ... I'm not going to spoil it for you, but let's say I did not expect that at all.Very well told and truths that do hurt ... but are essential to be seen ... and learned from (hopefully)~kosmasp rated 10/10 on 26 August 2021"," Not a movie but a mirror: Best thing about this movie is, it doesn't try to be clever or something it's not. Or maybe it's Carey Mulligan. Can't decide. It's a straight forward no nonsense revenge thriller that isn't like I spit on your grave or rather Hard Candy (which I expected it to be). It's just a very simple collective of 5 part story told cohesively and many people (on both ends and in middle) will find relatable.Special mention to the father daughter scene.Very well written, well shot, directed, scored and acted movie. And yes negative reviews are trying to sound clever but everyone knows they saw themselves in there.~matrixdukenukem rated 8/10 on 26 January 2021"," Debut efforts have no business being this good: I watched a lot of films in 2020 (167 to be exact) and gave only one of them a perfect 10/10 score. It took exactly one film in 2021 to match that. A sign of good things ahead hopefully. 'Promising Young Woman' is one of those rare treats of a film where you simply don't want it to end. Every aspect of it is perfect. Here's the kicker though - I couldn't wait to find out who the writer/director was afterwards. To my astonishment it was a debut effort from Emerald Fennell. Incredible stuff.Where to begin with this film? I think my single favourite thing about it was the dialogue. It was so exquisitely written (and performed for that matter). So many films lack any imagination in their dialogue these days, but not this film. It can be charming, charismatic, intriguing, thoughtful, funny and a hundred things in between. Also the music in this movie was perfect. I particularly loved the Toxic instrumental and the use of Angel of the Morning at the end. This is a soundtrack I would buy.I was aware of Carey Mulligan before this film, but incredibly I had never seen a single one of her films or television shows. I was blown away by how talented she is. The range she shows in one single character in 'Promising Young Woman' is almost beyond belief. I'm not sure if this is the type of film the Academy would ever recognise a performance in, but they absolutely should.I can't say enough goods things about this movie. It hits every note perfectly. 'Promising Young Woman' was an absolute pleasure to sit through and a film that you simply can't afford to miss.~jtindahouse rated 10/10 on 3 January 2021"," Dark film that's more complicated than some people realize: The imdb description reads ""A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path."" This is completely accurate, and yet is a superficial description. Yes, this is a movie about a woman attempting to create justice where none exists, but it's also about a deeply traumatized woman desperately doing things to give her a sense of control. This is why it's not a good criticism to say that what Cassie's doing doesn't make sense. It's true (like the IMDB description is true) but it's also the point. Cassie isn't Batman, and this isn't a cleverly thought-out system to make a better world. Cassie is broken but very smart and resourceful, and she is treating her inner wounds in an external way.The cast is very good, particularly Carey Mulligan as Cassie. The movie does a good job of keeping information from you and then dripping it out in order to create mystery and suspense then slow understanding. It's filmed stylishly. It's deeply disturbing, with a *very* dark view of human beings, and it leaves you with a lot to think about.It took me a while to watch this because I suspected it would be hard going and it is, in its own dark way, quite entertaining. Definitely worth watching.~cherold rated 8/10 on 29 April 2021"," A must watch movie.: Cass plays the part of the drunken, incapacitated party girl very, she seems to have one mission, stopping men that would take advantage of the situation, however she has one singular mission, revenge.This is a terrific story of revenge and consent. It's one of the best films I have seen for some time, no wonder it received to much praise, and so many nominations.I wonder if they'd thought about making this a slasher movie at any point, vibes of Killing Eve and I spit on your grave, without the gore. Twist after twist, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.This is one of those films that should be shown to teenagers, and young adults. It shows one thing, not all predators are alike, and they'll always have people who facilitate their behaviour. It also aims to show exactly what is meant by consent.You'll reach a point in the movie where you'll think it's over, but it isn't, there's another huge twist coming your way, I didn't see it coming.The one question this raises, is Cass a bad guy or not, it led to a really interesting conversation among my friends, all sorts of opinions.Oscar nominated for her role, Carey Milligan is fantastic, I've seen her in some great parts, but this must rank as one of her best, her character's development, and sudden shifts in behaviour are extraordinary.Bo Burnham is excellent in support, he is so good as Cass's distraction, the supporting cast are on point.Great movie.9/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 9/10 on 8 July 2023"," ""I guess it feels different when it's someone you love."": About mid-way into the movie I had to come to the conclusion that Cassie (Carey Mulligan) was dealing with mental illness in a way that stoked her necessity for revenge against those who humiliated her best friend Nina while in medical school ten years prior. Somehow she internalized some sense of guilt over Nina's death, even though she wasn't at the particular party where Nina got drunk and subsequently raped. It's not made clear how Nina died, but one assumes that she committed suicide as a result of the trauma she suffered with an inability to carry on. What cinched the mental illness idea for me was when she stopped her car in the middle of the road and took a lug wrench to the guy's truck who was taunting her for his inconvenience. The reaction there was over the top and out of proportion, even if the driver was a jerk. There was also that comment from Cassie's mom (Jennifer Coolidge) to the detective investigating her later disappearance when she said that Cassie was 'getting better'.What's immensely clever about the screenplay and the acting is how matter of fact Cassie could be when dealing with friends and her family. Actress Carey Mulligan as Cassie wears so many faces in the story that it's a tribute to her ability to charm or scare the hell out of someone by simply switching gears the way she did with Dean Walker (Connie Britton). The revelation of her potential boyfriend Ryan's (Bo Burnham) presence at the fraternity party years ago is what pushed Cassie over the edge. Many won't agree with me on this, but it's my feeling that Cassie's revenge mission at the bachelor party was her way of committing suicide, partly over grief for her long lost friend, and partly for her inability to move on in life, as was well depicted in the scene with Nina's mother (Molly Shannon).Why come to a suicide conclusion? At the wedding of the man who killed her (Chris Lowell), Ryan receives timed text messages as if they were coming from Cassie, who by now is already dead. Those would have to have been planned by someone who felt that they might not be around to send or deliver the message in person. So at least the thought of being killed had to have been on Cassie's mind when she concocted her revenge plan. And by walking into a situation where death might be imminent, Cassie was at least complicit for the disaster that befell her.I can't really say that ""Promising Young Woman"" is strong enough as a film to garner this year's Best Picture Oscar, but of all the contenders I've seen so far (and I'll see them all), this is the one that I feel will last in memory the longest because of it's dreadful impact. It's conclusion is one I don't think most viewers will see coming, having been entertained by Cassie and Ryan's humorous banter throughout the picture, thereby setting up an expectation that Cassie would emerge a likely hero. The story could have been written that way, but then, who would remember it?~classicsoncall rated 8/10 on 7 April 2021"," Left, middle, right: It's a message for everyone to hear: I have 3 little ones. Two boys and a girl. On one hand, I'd never want my sons to be accused of or punished for something they DIDN'T do, on the other hand I'd never want anything to happen to my daughter & then especially no one believe her. I myself went through my own ""event"" at a Halloween party almost ten years ago when I was a young 20 year old girl. I think what hurts more than the actual night, and the person who did it, it's all the family and close friends who didn't believe me, ignored me, or even blamed me. After a while you just stop talking about it. You shut it away. & Then this brilliant movie comes into your life. This movie sends two clear messages: It doesn't matter what you were wearing, how much you had to drink, your past relationships, if you made the first move... If you weren't cognitive enough to make a consensual choice, or you said no, or you fought it, seriously it WAS NOT your fault. And the other clear message, she gave each guy in the movie a chance to do the right thing and they chose not to. They actively chose to make the wrong choice. So, they were completely at fault and deserved their day of reckoning. I only wish I had a friend even half the character Cassie is in this movie. My best friend since we were children said it was my fault because I was dressed too sexy (I was dressed in a 1920's flapper costume from Walmart & had a hoodie on top of it). We haven't spoken in years because of that. Today, her words still haunt me more than that night and make me sick to my stomach. You're loved ones should have your back more than anyone. So the message of true devotion in friendship and sisterhood here was especially lovely. This isn't something that happens exclusively to only a certain type of woman, this happens to all women. & Movies like this will be how we put an end to it for our future, our children & loved ones.~ikillam rated 8/10 on 6 October 2021"

Sorry for all these capital letters, but the first hour nothing much happens and I was wondering if anything was about to happen at all. Well, fortunately it did!The REAL suspense and thrill (only slowly yet steadily) intensifies during the second hour, which gets really creepy and intense, with a final that is like a sledgehammer. Wow. Really impressed by it.The good: Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro.This man has got charisma few other actors (are lucky to) have. He really steals the show, with his very subtle acting skills, that convey so many different feelings that simply watching Benicio del Toro lifting up a small glass to drink is fascinating to watch.Benicio del Toro co-wrote the screenplay and he co-produced this movie as well. So he had a lot of cloud. And it shows, because this is one heck of a Benicio del Toro flick.The director made his feature movie debut, with only having made lots of music videos before and although I dont think his direction was terrific, it certainly was a masterful debut.Quite impressed AND spooked out by it. Recommended for the art house movie fans of slowburning (yet still suspenseful) detective movies.~imseeg rated 8/10 on 30 September 2023"," Solid police drama that could have been braver in the end: Benicio Del Toro co-writes this gritty, granular police procedural about a murdered real estate agent. Who killed her? Her fiancé, Justin Timberlake, her soon-to-be ex-husband, or a sketchy weirdo played convincingly by Michael Pitt?But then, heavy spoiler alert, the final act: when Del Toro comes home one night from the job, he finds signs of a break in. The pool is leaking. You think, Oh no, the killer got to his wife!But she's not dead - she's shot at Pitt and put a hole in the pool. Pitt is there, it turns out, to give Del Toro a clue. One of those handy thumb drives with all sorts of damning digital evidence.The real estate thing involves the cops, and drugs, and something about money laundering. Del Toro confronts the cops, at one of their homes, at nine in the morning, and a shootout ensues. End of story.He doesn't even go after Timberlake, who instead we see golfing in a penultimate scene, then the FBI ride up in a golf cart and nab him.Roll credits.I mean, Jesus.What started out as a creepy, interesting story with lots of tension devolved into a by-the-numbers ""corrupt cops"" trope. Granted, a lot of this was done well. The pacing feels brisk, the editing crisp. Del Toro is great, his wife played by Alicia Silverstone is great, and it was refreshing to have their marriage be healthy and functional.The music is on point, too. The direction and camera work consists of the usual intensive continuity with way too many close ups, but that's nearly every film today.Se7en this is not. This is Netflix doing a pretty good job of creating a serviceable cop drama with some flashes of originality that ultimately isn't brave or bold enough to not fall victim to the most pat formula resolution.I mean, who or what was ""reptile"" anyway? Who even actually killed the woman at the beginning? What was the significance of her wounds - being stabbed so hard the knife penetrated bone?? What were the potential bite marks on her hand all about?? It's like the writers thought to present a great mystery but only figured out how to solve some of it.Close, Del Toro, but no cigar.~timmyhollywood rated 7/10 on 6 October 2023"," Maybe a little too escoteric for a mass audience but an excellent thriller nevertheless.: This slow-burner of a murder yarn may just turn out to be the best thriller of the year. A realtor is found dead by her colleague and partner who naturally becomes a suspect but then there are a few other men in her life who are also suspects; so far, so common-place but Grant Singer's ""Reptile"" is as much about the police investigating the killing as it is about the investigation. These are a close-knit bunch of cops who both work and play together and who may not be as clean as they should be.A sterling cast, (Benicio Del Torro, Alicia Silverstone, Justin Timberlake, Eric Bogosian, Michael Pitt, Frances Fisher), add a further touch of class to an already classy thriller and one that is as far from conventional multiplex fare as you are likely to get. It may not always be that easy to follow and midway through the killing seems to fade into the background but it's always highly intelligent and while it may not appeal to a mass audience I think it has cult status written all over it.~MOscarbradley rated 7/10 on 30 September 2023"," Neo-Noir From ""Netflix"" & Benicio del Toro...Gritty Dark Character Driven Detective Story: Music-Director Grant Singer Teams-Up with Benicio del Toro and Delivers this ""Netflix"" Original for His 1st Feature-Film.A Bleak Detective Thriller that is Driven by a Moody Neo-Noir Tone.It's about del Toro, a Transplant Detective Trying to Avoid Mistakes-Made in the Past, and is Caught-Up in a Murder-Corruption Case where ""Bad"" is Overwhelmingly Everywhere.He ""Bites-the-Bullet"" and Hunkers-Down as Events and Revelations Slow-Burn the Case and the Film.The Tone is Suppressing, Dark, and Deep.

I'd give it a miss.~robNorseman rated 8/10 on 29 September 2023"," Del Toro is awesome and the acting is aces but there are too many loose ends: Reptile is a movie that starts out, absolutely fantastic builds to a crescendo about halfway through, and then falls apart through all the red herrings, macguffins, and unresolved loose ends, that it presents in an effort to give us a dramatic end to this murder mystery/procedural drama.Benicio Del Toro delivers possibly the best performance I've ever seen him give he can often seem slimy, slick or creepy but in this film, he comes across just as he intends you to see him, which is as a man with a spotty history as a policeman, but greatly desiring to get onto the street and narrow. He is supported by his dutiful wife Judy, played by Alicia Silverstone in a really strong performance.Justin Timberlake gives us a turn as the bereaved boyfriend of the murder victim, Timberlake and his mother, played by Frances Farmer, who is very underused on the real estate company that Timberlake and his girlfriend work for.Quickly the suspects add up. There is the girlfriends soon to be ex-husband; then there's Eli who Timberlake and farmer have screwed out of his families property. There's also some sort of a weird creepy guy out of the church that's getting painted in the middle of nowhere. This is apparently a piece of property that the girlfriend sold but revisited. This plot point is never revisited, nor dug into any further, yet the paint that they've been using to paint the church appears on the victim and on the victims soon to be ex-husband.Finally, we discover that the whole business is a result of police corruption and drug trafficking and money laundering. The police corruption goes so deep. We are not quite sure who's clean and who's dirty. This also leads to all sorts of loose ends that we are provided.There's a scene with Del Toro at a therapists office as required after a shooting and he talks of a dream. Then later he has a dream or does he? It would seem that the dream which is very plot specific reveals the killer out right and no point do we get any indication that his realization of who the killer is wasn't a real occurrence rather than the dream it is presented as. But so many questions abound.Why would any self-respecting policeman on the teak hang on to the vehicle that was used by the killer to kill the victim?Was the killer actually the police chief and not the boyfriend? We don't know we're never told.Why does Timberlake's character show up just days after the murder of his girlfriend with a girl that looks almost identical to that girlfriend in a restaurant where he runs into the detective leading the case? Further why would he have showed up with this girl and does she have any relevance to the plot that follows? No. It's another blind alley.Is del Toro's partner in on the corruption? At the end we don't know.What was the point of the police pulling Del Toro and his wife over after the party? If only to lead them home? It's possible it was to reinforce the fact that the police corruption goes deeper than he is aware. However, if this is the case it never comes up, or is never revealed at the end of the film. We just don't know what happens.Who actually killed the victim in the film? It is never really divulged who that is. We are led to believe it is the boyfriend, but then if it is, why is the car that was used by the killer parked in the chief of police house?Eli is killed off screen and this time we know Timberlake is in on it but we're not allowed to see who else is present in the room and it is never revealed to us even though it is alluded to.Finally, the climax of the film has some of the most confusing things in it. Del Toro gives the evidence to the police captain, and they both go to see the chief of police to confront him with what they have. Now Del Toro's character has given over the evidence that Eli provided him to the police captain, whom we assume is on the take and Del Toro is unaware. This fact when realized really makes Del Toro seem like a rookie detective and not the seasoned guy he supposed to be.When the chief of police whispers to Del Toro to leave because he's been found out, and that the captain is in on it, before Del Toro can leave, we must assume that the head of the DEA, who is a friend of Del Toro's is responsible for murdering the chief of police in his own home. Hearing this gunshot, Del Toro goes in to the bathroom where the captain has retreated and confront him and kills him. Then Del Toro's friend comes down the stairs after having killed a police, chief and attempt to kill del Toro. They have a gun fight, and Del Toro mortally ones his friend Dave. Then Del Toro picks up his phone and calls 911. We don't see police cars. He doesn't speak to the police or 911 yet in the next scene, we see Timberlake being arrested by the FBI while playing golf and then the next scene cuts to Del Toro Having his wife dip, his hands in hot wax, supposedly/assumedly to remove any gun shot residue he might have on his hands. But why? What is the shooting a good shooting? Or a bad shooting? We'll never know. The Director decides to leave us right there. We don't know if Del Toro is a good cop, who discovered a nest of vipers as the title would lead us to believe or if the FBI stumble across this whole thing on their own, and after their investigation, finally get around to arresting Timberlake. We don't see Francis farmer arrested. We don't see the police force getting arrested for this corruption and drug smuggling and money laundering and murder.So while the film has incredible acting, and has a really neat premise, it just sort of falls apart at the end, because all these questions are left on answered, and there are just too many little bits and pieces that are thrown in that have no reason to be there..~johnbthomasiii80 rated 6/10 on 3 October 2023"," An intelligent mystery: For those who like murder mysteries like me, this is an excellent movie. My fave shows and movies are BBC mysteries and Nordic Noir - well written and well acted productions. Certainly, for the mystery-affectionado, this is a quality production from top to bottom - acting, writing, story-line, camera work, production. Benicio Del Torro is a pleasure to watch. I feel like the story was somewhat familiar but I appreciate a movie which re-covers a certain theme but in a quality way. For those who enjoy an intelligent mystery / thriller, they will enjoy this movie. For those who want a more shoot 'em up, car chase, action-packed show, this will disappoint.

Singer and Brewer wrote the initial draft of the film in 2018 where it was acquired by Black Label Media who'd previously worked with Del Toro on the Sicario films and upon showing it to him he became a huge proponent of the project. With a gritty noir story, an all star cast, and an Autumn adjacent release date you can tell Netflix wants this to be their equivalent of Gone Baby Gone or Prisoners as that dark horse crime thriller that scores some Oscar nominations, and while it doesn't reach those heights unfortunately it's an ultimately decent detective thriller with a strong sense of style and some committed performances.Despite being the debut feature of Grant Singer, he shows a strong grasp on filmmaking from a stylistic and technical sense with the film given some solid shots that capture the environments in which Nichols investigates. With a predominantly suburban setting that often uses the states of various homes like McMansion Grady is trying to sell having signs of vermin infestation or a neglected swimming pool with stagnant water, you get the sense Singer is trying to capture that underlying sense of rot within these seemingly idyllic homes. While Tom Nichols isn't given the greatest depth as a protagonist, del Toro who serves as a co-writer on the film does add some humanity to the role especially in regards to his relationship with his wife Judy played by Alicia Silverstone who takes what could've been an underwritten character and makes her more of a confidant who actually assists Tom on several occasions and the two have some solid chemistry together. Where the movie faulters for me unfortunately is in the mystery aspect of the film especially in how it establishes its array of suspects only for us to switch gears at the one hour mark where we begin another decidedly different investigation. The writing in the film while fine most of the time is perfectly fine (if not exceptional) but it does lead to some groanworthy dialogue exchanges and a fake-out dream sequence that I didn't really care for.For those who like dramatic procedural thrillers of this kind you will find some good elements to appreciate here especially in how it relates to the acting and visuals on display. The movie itself as a mystery I'm sorry to say fell somewhat flat for me despite seemingly having all the right pieces in play. A slight stumble out the gate for Grant Singer, but one that shows promise if given refinement.~IonicBreezeMachine rated 6/10 on 29 September 2023"," Satisfying, surprisingly so: Well what do you think if that. A neo noir drama meant for actual adults that is not insulting to the intelligence or wrapped up in gimmicks. Excellent casting of experienced character actors and nice performances from Alicia Silverstone, too many times typecast, and Justin Timberlake,not just a disney brat-boy band hottie . It's reminiscent of american crime dramas that rely on story and character and a sense of paranoia and foreboding rather than car chases, flashy scenario or snappy dialogue. I was pleasantly surprised. Much more restrained than say a Sydney Lumet drama. Nice to see new blood escaping typical formulas for the genre. It's always worth giving a look at what Benecio del Toro involves himself.~lu_lou_belle rated 9/10 on 30 September 2023"," Neo Noir Thriller: If you are interested in watching a good thriller, shot at a good pace, with twists and turns, than this is for you.Do not buy into some of the reviews, they do not reflect the general feedback. This is a very very good neo noir thriller with nice subtleties and some very good acting, particularly from Del Toro. Timberlake is quite good too, allowing for more method in his performance.I found the dynamic between Del Toro and Alecia Silverstone strong, with the Clueless star playing a much more important role than you often see from the protagonists spouse' in these films.Very good, gritty at times, with some minor plot gaps, which can be forgiven as the story evolves into a thrilling finale.~amcdkc rated 8/10 on 29 September 2023"
Fast X (2023) - IMDb,5.8,Vin Diesel|Michelle Rodriguez|Jason Statham|Jordana Brewster|Tyrese Gibson|Ludacris|Nathalie Emmanuel|Charlize Theron|John Cena|Sung Kang|Helen Mirren|Brie Larson|Scott Eastwood|Jason Momoa|Alan Ritchson|Luis Da Silva Jr.|Daniela Melchior|Leo Abelo Perry,"Louis Leterrier|Justin Lin(began filming, was replaced) (uncredited)",Dan Mazeau|Justin Lin|Zach Dean,Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes.," Excruciatingly Awful: I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the ""family"". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real ""family"". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.~MamadNobari97 rated 1/10 on 30 June 2023"," The worst one yet.: Fast & Furious 9 did what a lot of franchises do at some point: it took the action into outer space. This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 19 May 2023"," What Happened?: I can write the exact same review for the last Transformers, last Indiana Jones, last Star Wars movies, last FF or last Marvel movies etc... What happaned people? Something has happened in movie industry in late 2010's - 2017 or 18. We cannot see any decent plot, any consistent story-telling or any sympathetic characters anymore. Day after day we have to endure more & more imbecilic movies with idiotic characters... new movies come out and this pattern never changes.It's really not an easy job to be a movie-lover as of 2020's! :((PS: .... and we see the above trend here in imdb too, as it insists on some ""minimum character limit"". Oh my!!~feritciva rated 1/10 on 15 July 2023"," Fast X: By this point, I went to see Fast X without a clue as to what happened in the last one. I think some people went to space.The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.~Prismark10 rated 5/10 on 1 June 2023"," They need to stop: The movie starts it story from the first ten minutes of Fast Five. The story starts out of nowhere and thr scenes are not even connected properly with each other. Any scene comes out of nowhere. The performances by all the cast members felt weak and the character development of the main Villian was bad. Jason's character wanted revenge in the movie but it more looked like he was a psycho who kills people for fun. The main problem with this franchise is saturated. It feels like we have seen all this millions of times and the action scenes doesn't amaze you.Overall, it was an average action movie and the franchise has reached fatigue.~akshatmahajan rated 4/10 on 15 June 2023"," I literally thought this was a parody skit off of SNL!: I have to admit all you people who forewarned me still didn't prepare me for the absolute most ridiculous movie in this franchise & definitely in the top 20 of worst movies ever! Everything was forced, the acting was stale and wooden, nobody seemed to care that they were looking like what they were out there doing! Stroking Vin's ego and not caring how they came across. They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable! If you don't want to waste 3 hours of your life, skip this and watch Looney Tunes, they are superior in every way!~towe-51620 rated 1/10 on 26 May 2023"," its comically bad: You know the deal by now, family, fast cars, hot girls(not so many this time), A-list celebrities, cheesy dialogue and story all wrapped up in a high budget movie that barely makes sense. It is not supposed to make sense of course. Even if there ever was an attempt to convey street racing culture at the beginning of the franchise all is but gone replaced by a forgettable action flick that deserves to be a streaming only release.If you went to the cinemas for this bore fest of pointless explosions I feel bad for you. I am not even go into the story, the only saving grace of these movies at this point is the polished cg and well done stunts. Just do society a favor and stop rewarding mindless micheal bay movies.~gehete-40949 rated 2/10 on 28 June 2023"," Void In between car action: First, the car actions are great, a lot of imagination, a lot of CGI, and great locations.In-between, we get some asskicking, much more ordinary.Following these hate scenes, we get some emotional scenes.Like love for family is everything. And of course some of them are dying to go back to some hate.Diesel is such a bad actor, impossible to accept any of his emotional scenes, be it love or hate. He has not evolved in 20years of filming. There is nothing in between, just primitive emotions for the brainless.Jason Momoa is the bad guy, followed be some minor bad guys. His character is so over the top, and he obviously enjoyed the acting. But some maniac jokes of bad taste are not funny at all.His scenes are the only ones worth watching along with the fake computer generated car stunts, who throw overboard the most basic laws of physics. It is just incredible how many stuntmen and visual effects experts worked on that movie. I suppose each one only worked on 5 seconds of a scene. They all need to be paid, and it surely takes a hell of a resource management to make it a coherent finished product.The music is just annoying during the stunts, just too loud, a brain killer...For a budget of 349 mio USD, a lot of stars appear just for a few seconds, like they visit to attract people to the theatres to keep the money flowing in, and leave with the loot.I won't name them, I don't want to be an acomplice of their deception...~tomsawyer-01858 rated 4/10 on 30 June 2023"," When ""Avengers"" meets ""Fast and the furious"" everything goes wrong: I am (was) a huge fan of the ""fast and the furious"" series, and of Vin Diesel. Although I am a physicist I can live with ""curbing"" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it's simply too much.The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon's foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it's not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It's one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.~schorschi100 rated 2/10 on 8 June 2023"," Toretto just started playing Rocket League in the middle of Italy.: Fast X finally went too far.As far as I remember, people keep complaining about this movies being dumb, however, people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a ""revenge plot"" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of ""I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad"". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) - IMDb,7.7,Daniel Radcliffe|Emma Watson|Rupert Grint|Eric Sykes|Timothy Spall|David Tennant|Mark Williams|James Phelps|Oliver Phelps|Bonnie Wright|Jeff Rawle|Robert Pattinson|Jason Isaacs|Tom Felton|Stanislav Yanevski|Robert Hardy|Philip Rham|Olivia Higginbottom,Mike Newell,Steve Kloves|J.K. Rowling,"Harry Potter finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but he is distracted by recurring nightmares."," Good though rushed: Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.~cosmic_quest rated 6/10 on 18 November 2005"," Dark and engrossing!: I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 22 April 2009"," See the movie for action, read the book for story: It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn't going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen.~imdb-10900 rated 8/10 on 22 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the TriWizard Cup.: ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is the best of all Harry Potter movies of all(at least until now),and also the only one that I gave a vote bigger then 7. As all my Harry Potter comments, I need to say again that the book is so much better and has much more details who are important in the series, but this is the first of all movies who really deserve my applause. The effects are better, the cast looks more comfortable in their respective roles and even being a summary of the books,''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' finally was a good movie. Of course that since the fourth book is very big, many, MANY parts are not showed in the movie,including details about the relationship between Cedric and Harry and also when Harry was in the Quidditch World Cup.aka ""Harry Potter e o Cálice de Fogo"" - Brazil~Lady_Targaryen rated 9/10 on 5 January 2006"," what the hell?!: As a fan of the potter book series, I'm going to start with my opinion of the movie,and then I'm going to slaughter the adaption.as a movie this was ALMOST amazing. the special effects (other than the captives under the water) were generally of an excellent standard. The acting of the trio was well above what it has been previously. Especially in the case of Emma Watson, who was initially terrible but has improved with each movie. Bravo i say! Rupert Grint is always a joy to watch. he really is Ron Wealsey for me, despite that fact that hes the same height as Radcliffe. speaking of Radcliffe, i was exceptionally impressed! he was brilliant for the most part, but especially during the scenes with Voldemort in the grave yard and when he returned to Hogwarts. However, credit given to those, i have to say that Alan Rickman as Snape is the best! This isn't just because he is my favourite character but i genuinely thought that he was brilliant, particularly during the scene when Harry and Ron keep talking. dumbledore on the other hand was atrocious. I'm afraid this is where my commentary moves onto slaughtering the adaption.Since when exactly, has Dumbledore ever lost control and shaken Harry. If this is how he reacts to harry's name being entered, what the hell is he going to do when Harry destroys his office in The Order of the Pheonix. Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but he just isn't Dumbledore.and is it me or did the film lack certain key elements that made the book? such as the fact that Harry has a parent figure now? when the Thing with Sirius happens in OOTP, the audience wont know anything about him. And the scene with the Dursleys at the beginning was one of the best in the book! I understand that for the obvious reasons such as time management, certain elements have to be omitted, but this really did take the biscuit. Why alter scenes which arnt vital to the book, such as the way that the first task played out, and then cut what makes the books great. The two things that really wound me up were the way that Sirius appeared in the fire (why the hell they did it like that ill never understand) and the change in who gave Harry the Gillyweed. Those changed really were pointless.When viewed as a movie in its own right the Goblet of Fire is as enjoyable, thrilling and down right scary as the book is, but as an adaption, to be quite honest, it was a let down.~em_1986 rated 7/10 on 18 November 2005"," HP4: While Prisoner was a step forward I alway felt like the film adaptation of Goblet was a step back simply due to time. Goblet really should be longer to cover all the stuff going on here. Yes, we have the games but in order to do that right the whole movie has to be about that. There's not enough time to explore all the other stuff going on here, the relationships shifting and adapting, the mystery of what's going on. None of this feels more epitomized than in the relationship of Ron and Harry. Best buddies up until now and yet, suddenly they're fed up with each other. I understand the reasoning of it all but it doesn't feel like the film is allowed to live in that enough to make the reactions feel reasonable or earned.Goblet of fire is still decent, it just doesn't feel like a step forward for the series. It's entirely necessary but doesn't progress or amp up in a meaningful enough way. Not that it really matters because at this point you're likely 3-4 movies in and you're either going to see this through or you're not. Just know that it gets progressively better from here.~questl-18592 rated 6/10 on 24 March 2021"," A huge, HUGE disappointment...: Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.What I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style, substance, or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes (especially the fight with the dragon) just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The Tri-Wizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blow-up at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by (the last day of school) and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!I can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon, Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him, slipping and sliding, peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge, defenseless, and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. And for that matter, no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do, even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron, it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true, why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy, I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point, Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT, yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film, a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay, even if it means going completely against character.But I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil, he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film (and by a quartet of ghosts, no less, which took cheesiness to a new level). The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but, in actuality, he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But, of course, that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation, again, seems ridiculous in retrospect.The entire Tri-Wizard tournament seemed a little off-kilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents, but to what end? The final test consists of entering an ever-changing maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So, even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge, if you're the first to find the trophy, you win anyway. So, I ask you, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? Looking back, I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film - Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back, sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path.~TheScraggler rated 6/10 on 18 November 2005"," Dark, and funny.: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.Coming back to the show are the fantastic three. Dan has come into his own. He is Harry. He is vulnerable, angry, not always sure what to do, and has actually gotten quite good at comedy routines. Rupert Grint is not just used for comedic relief this time. He gets jealous of Harry for getting into the tournament, and is tired of being referred to as ""Harry Potter's Stupid Friend"". Emma Watson is beautiful and plays the supporter of Harry largely, but does it well. The other children are a blast to watch, especially Neville and Fred and George. I liked how more attention came to the character of Cedric Diggory, and his brief relationship to Harry.The adult actors are sparingly but well used. Alan Rickman only has two main scenes (He probably did about one day of filming) but it's just enough. Maggie Smith is equally funny and Micheal Gambon is used more than in the previous film. He thankfully has one fatherly scene in this film, which was lacking in PoA. Brendan Gleeson is hilariously over-the-top as ""Mad-Eye"", a vicious old dark wizard catcher assigned to be the new Dark Arts teacher.The humor has grown more adult, which fits the growing audience better. Sexuality and Excellent Writing replace most of the repetition gags and silly physical humor of Columbus and Cuaron. This fits J.K. Rowling's style much better actually. It's all very funny and very British, as it should be. As for the teen problems? Getting a date for the dance, and learning to dance. Dealing with rejection and hormones. We've all been there. It's all very real and well done. These kids feel like real people, not mythical elves or gods.The movie is close to 3 hours, but chances are you'll spend most of it either laughing or terrified. Harry's round with the dragon is intensely scary but amazing. His second task, slightly less so, but the dragon was a tough act to follow. The maze is scary, easily a villain by itself. Think ""The Shining"" on crack. The finale will leave pretty much anyone with a soul breathless and crying. Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort. Dark times indeed.Not for anyone who hasn't seen the other movies or read the books (or doesn't want to because it's not ""cool""), but who gives a crap about them? Not for kids under 12 (they'll go to see it anyway, I've seen 7 year olds read the 6th book), but this stuff is scary for anyone. Diehards who want every side-plot of the book included will be disappointed. C'mon guys, the movie's almost 3 hours anyway (Though I was genuinely disappointed at the lack of further exposition about Neville Longbottom)! The movie does the best at being comprehensible without aid of reference from the books of it's predecessors, and is a genuinely exceptional comedy/thriller, and feels epic and yet real. And that's a tall order to deliver for a story about magic and a wizard. Mike Newell is a god truly.Not for the faint of heart, this gets an A~joestank15 rated 10/10 on 18 November 2005"," Fourth episode with Harry Potter and friends fighting dark forces in this amazing adventure: This fourth installment of J.K.

However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.~AetherTheory rated 9/10 on 21 November 2005"

He meets and quickly falls for Rita (Tina Fey), a nosy neighbor who is eager to help solve the mystery."," a breath of fresh air: I'm really starting to like Jon Hamm in his recent movies. He plays a calm mature and sweet man very well. This time as a policeman. If you are tired of CGI films without a story, of Hollywood pap that just wants kids through the doors, try this film.So it's a murder mystery (for the policeman, the viewer knows who did it, but its nice watching them go through the process). Also, there are novel and interesting characters that interact beautifully. To be honest all the characters were acted well, and half the film really is about the dilemmas of the 4 or 5 key characters. Although there are some deaths, its not excessively gory and it isn't an action film. Reminds me a bit of the murder mysteries we'd see in the late 80s, but in this story is much better, characters are 3d, and filming very polished. Yep, the story is a little quirky, but pretty believable. There is a romantic sub-plot, which is complicated by one being a widower, and the other being divorced, but it takes on some modern themes very well.For me a good film requires a good and well told story, with good characters. This is what this film is. No high drama (except may a little toward end, and a bit of a surprise), but I loved the way it was presented and paced. Made it feel like real life without being dull at any time. Maybe the film is an 8, but I gave it a 9 just because it was laid out so well and skillfully.Maybe people under 25 will find it slow or no dramatic enough, but I think most older people (male and female) will find this a fulfilling film covering a few interesting themes and with an interesting murder mystery aspect. Comedy? Not really, though some light touches which are sweet/funnyish. Go on, give it a go.~uberdonkey6 rated 9/10 on 4 August 2023"," Basic as basic can be: If you enjoy basic movies, with a run of the mill plot, mediocre acting, little to no chemistry and a blended storyline that makes sure to include romance, basic humor, murder and cops then this movie is for you!!!Really not much here that I can say was remarkable or even really enjoyable. John ham and Fey are okay I guess, but every scene just seems flat with little chemistry. I doubt there were many takes and they just moved thru the script during filming.I just don't really see the point of this. Bad guys, good cops, damsel in distress, unsolved murder. There's literally hundreds of better versions of this type of story. Bland 5.2/10.~zack_gideon rated 5/10 on 17 June 2023"," Doesn't work when it's light, doesn't work when it's serious: This might just be the toughest type of film to get right. The mixing of two drastically different tones is such a hard mix to get right. A lot of people consider the Coen brothers to be some of the best to ever do it - and even they didn't always get it right.The main problem with 'Maggie Moore(s)' is that it does really work in either mode. When it is trying to be light and funny it just comes across painfully dull. And when it shifts into serious mode, it offers nothing that a thousand other similar films haven't done before. There is no point of difference in this movie.They try to make up for a painfully flat script with some big names in the cast, but even that isn't close to enough to save it. It just makes some very bad dialogue be delivered slightly better. It's still bad dialogue. This was a misfire on all levels. A generous 4/10.~jtindahouse rated 4/10 on 2 July 2023"," Fun 1990s-Style Dark Comedy: Sometimes I just look at the barest details of a film and instantly know I'll like it, and Maggie Moore(s) is one of those examples. I rented it on a whim and was pleased with what is essentially a quirky dark comedy done in the style of late 1990s and/or early 2000s. There's nothing specifically retro about this movie, it's just in the pattern of a certain sub-genre of comedy that i like. It makes a lot of sense then that an almost unrecognizably older Tina Fey plays one of the supporting roles.John Hamm is decent because he never actually has to be funny. Everyone else is funny around him! He's 'the straight man."" SO he can be the basic good guy cop grieving his dead wife who is afraid to move on. While this role holds none of the demands of the odious womanizer Don Draper, it also has none of the demands of being a comedic actor, which John Hamm is not. No problem here!I found this flick legitimately enjoyable though some aspects were ridiculous it doesn't take away from the overall light mood and the reasonable progression of a cohesive story line. YMMV depending on what you consider funny, obviously.~thalassafischer rated 7/10 on 2 September 2023"," Slow Burn Thriller that Pays Off: Don't understand the hate for this nifty little thriller. Bodies start to pile up in a small town in Albuquerque, New Mexico. John Hamm and his trusty assistant Deputy Ready are on hand to sniff out the clues and put the pieces of this tricky puzzle together.Hamm and Tina Fey feature some nice chemistry and work well to keep the energy going. Sure there are elements of Fargo and Rear Window sewn into the plot but, they only act as pepper there's much more seasoning here to keep you interested.The picture is lensed by John Hamm's former Mad Men co-star John Slattery. He has a nice feel for suspense, tension and utilizes the dramatic mountain ranges of New Mexico to good effect.A fine supporting cast of memorable character actors keep you interested. There's a twist or two but, mostly it's a slow burn thriller that pays off. Give it a try.~GeneralUrsus rated 9/10 on 25 June 2023"," Uneven. Not hitting the mark. Too slow. Just... not.: Not a terrible ""comedy"", but a rather SLOW one, with very few real jokes that made me laugh.More bad: some of the actors (even the leading ones) just dont hit it of. No actor's chemistry. No spark or punch.Not any good then at all? No, the story in itself is rather quirky and interesting and out of whack at moments. BUT there are basically 2 stories trying to be told. The one about a looser, who gets into deep trouble with the wrong criminal guys and the other story is sort of an quirky romantic story, which fails to lift of.One of those movies that doesnt start out bad at all, but one of those movies that you also get that nagging feeling halfway through that it is going nowhere.~imseeg rated 5/10 on 24 June 2023"," Dialogues to die for: Maggie Moore is about the murder of two women with the same name. And two cops directing their investigation, which led them to a suicide with a confession left on a PC.The relationship between the two cops is amusing and original, as are the relationships of the murdered woman's husbands. Everything fits together wonderfully in a world of loosers.One of the cops' wives died, and despite receiving offers for emotional relationships from other ladies during the investigation, he remains attached to his wife, while the other hopes he could be in his place ...The dialogue is slow and sombre, yet profoundly funny.One of the women refuses to fix the passenger's airbag for $3000 because ""I don't like nobody that much."" A lifesaving decision, lol.The film is much more about individuals, their character, and their fate than it is about crimes, as everything is laid out, and Happy Anderson is as a hilarious gamer and assassin as John Goodman was in Barton Fink.Some people are born joyful and stay that way, while others fight losing battle after battle until they lose the war...Dialogues with a philosophical underpinning.I had a great time.Jon Hamm's performance was brilliant once again, and he helped all actors rise to his level.~tomsawyer-01858 rated 8/10 on 8 September 2023"," If the Story had been told from fewer angles, they would have maintained more suspense and interest.: Maggie Moore(s) is a new crime comedy directed by John Slattery. He is more known as an actor but has previously directed the movie God's Pocket. He has also directed several episodes of the TV series Mad Men, in which actor John Hamm also played a major role.Local Sheriff Jordan Sanders (Jon Hamm) teams up with his deputy Reddy (Nick Mohammed) to solve a murder mystery. The murder mystery is about two women with the same name, Maggie Moore, who were murdered in quick succession in the same town.This murder mystery seems to affect the entire small town and leads to many different clues and suspects, even one of the partners of one of the victims.Director John Slattery has not directed any films since 2014. The same applies to script writer Paul Bernbaum, who has not written an independent script since 2006. The fact that both have not been active in this profession for a while can unfortunately be seen in the final film.For example, the story is told from too many different angles, such as that of the police sheriff, the mastermind of the murders, the killer himself, and some witness. By showing all these different angles, the story sometimes remains difficult to follow. Because as a viewer you also get more and earlier answers than, for example, the police sheriff himself, you can also keep anticipating the story. The murder mystery and who the perpetrators are, for example, is shown to you as a viewer all too quickly. As a result, the murder mystery only loses its mysterious sides. Had they brought the story from lesser sides, the movie could have remained more of a murder mystery. As a viewer you would have had a chance to try to solve this mystery yourself.Despite the lesser script, Jon Hamm puts in good and appropriate acting as a police sheriff who tries to investigate everything down to the smallest details. Together with Nick Mohammed, he comes across as a good and credible police sheriff with a deputy sheriff, who always tries to deliver comedy at the wrong times. Tina Fey sometimes also comes across as a nosy neighbor who tries to get everything on board rather than her character being really helpful to the story. They also set up a kind of dating story between her and Jon Hamm that seems a bit detached compared to the rest of the film. The angle of the creator of the murders is also less interesting to follow, because this is a less enjoyable storyline and you don't really care about this character anyway.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 4/10 on 2 July 2023"," Weird and fun: I'm surprised so many reviews are saying this movie isn't good. It's exactly what it's billed as: a dark comedy. Jon Hamm and Tina Fey are fantastic in their roles. The other actors are wonderful and don't miss a beat. You never know what's gonna happen next, which is especially gratifying in the current film landscape of sequels and reboots. I enjoyed every strange, off-kilter moment of this, and the ending is pitch-perfect. A delightful film except for the inexcusable outcome for Deputy Reddy. If you like the Coen brothers' movies, you should connect with this - it very much strikes the same notes as Raising Arizona and Fargo - lots of death and deadpan characters.~dmasursky rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Fargo with mismatched cast and poor dialog: 1/2 way though this film I kept on wondering if I had seen it before. Unnecessary murders, Humanized chief of police, small town vistas, etc. Fargo without the snow. I also noticed that the characters seemed to be struggling to get away from the writers. They were dogged down with speech and actions that made no sense. Everyone seemed to be miscast. I love Tina Fey, don't get me wrong, but she was one of those actors who were underutilized and poorly formed. Jon Hamm was wooden, but when isn't he? I actually started to watch this because it was a chance to see Nick Mohammed In something other than Ted Lasso. Again, disappointing.I don't really care that this was a ripoff of Fargo, so much as it shoulda/coulda been a good ripoff. The elements were there, but only the killer was fresh (I won't spoil the plot, but he was pretty good at being evil).Throughout the movie, people kept on doing things that didn't make sense. In one of the scenes, where Tina Fey's character gets a hotel room was like a really nice song playing on a record player and suddenly someone sends the tonearm scratching across the entire record - jarring and nonsensical.Jon Hamm's character is grieving, but there is no substance to the grieving.And finally, the multiple victims in the story. No development. I would accuse the screenwriter of misogany with the first 2 murders, but he makes up for it with the last three. However, at least the last 3 got a chance for us to begin to see who they were. The women at the beginning had no chance at all - just victims.I will give the writer and filmmaker some credit, however for not dumbing down the audience. When tina's character, towards the end of the movie makes her fateful decision, you know from her encounter with the car repair man what drove (pun intended) her to her decision.I will give the set locations person and cinematographer a positive review - sets were gorgeous and real, and the cinematography helped to answer a few questions and move the plot along.All in all, this should have been a much better movie and was destroyed by bad writing, bad character development. And poor casting.I gave it 4 stars because i was willing to watch it to the end, and those of you who have not seen Fargo will enjoy it more than I did.~janet-42-167472 rated 4/10 on 18 June 2023"

I was a huge fan of Mr. Monk, and I used to enjoy the show immensely. The fact that we can have a quirky hero with OCD was intriguing and I was rooting for another season.But, if we can't have the show returning, a TV movie is great, right?Well, it could have been, but this has got to be the most lazy writing ever done for a movie.Mr. Monk isn't quirky, he's just awkward.He's not allowed to be clever and use his intelligence, because the case is so clumsy presented, that we all know who done it and how immediately.That means, the entire movie we're just waiting for Monk to catch up on what we already know, because no one made the effort of making an interesting case.Great to see all the belowed characters again, but man - I'm rage-writing this review because it's probably the only time the cast gets back together, and then they get a script written by a 10 year old.~Plazeebo rated NA on 9 December 2023"," I wish they hadn't made this.: Look, I love Monk, and it was really nice to see all the old characters again, but this was a terrible epilogue to a story that had a pretty excellent ending years ago.The series finale showed us an Adrian Monk who was a healed person, being happy, at long last, after years of torment.This movie took this happy ending and flushed it down the toilet.We're told that Covid made Monk regress completely, which was a real disservice to the character. I think a much more fun take would have been to visit Monk during Covid when the whole world had become like him, and to see him just enjoying life, and loving everyone's extra precautions.But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that they turned Monk not just into an unhappy man again, but actually full-on suicidal. Tonally, this was an absurd shift for the Monk universe. Way too heavy on a good day, and just a horrific choice considering that when we left Monk he was having his happily-ish ever after.The ghost of Trudy was also a terrible choice, but made so much worse by the writers going all-in on the ghosts at the end of the movie. It just didn't feel like Monk at all. It felt like some weird Lifetime movie or something.Lastly, the central mystery of the story just felt too small for the final Monk send-off. The last case we saw was him solving his own wife's murder. This one was just... not weighty at all.I think a better Monk movie would be a happy, Covid-era Monk, where he spent the movie entirely in his comfort zone, while it was the rest of the world that was newly and obsessively cleaning. A zen-like Mr. Monk against a panicking world would have given us the Monk we deserve, plenty of comedy, and movie worth making.~joshuavogel79 rated 3/10 on 9 December 2023"," I was ready for this to be good... and it was GREAT!: When I saw Randy Zisk was directing, Andy Breckman was writing, and everyone was coming back, the pit in my stomach kept churning: ""Please don't let this be a TV movie reunion cash-grab."" It wasn't. In fact, ""Mr. Monk's Last Case"" makes me sincerely hope it's not his last case.Everyone is back and it simultaneously feels like just yesterday when the last episode aired, and yet a whole era has passed. They don't shy away from COVID and how it affected Mr. Monk- in fact, they go deep. I wasn't expecting so much trauma to be revealed, and the even-deeper humanity it was treated with. The call to action at the end felt earned. Tony Shalhoub is hopefully in for another Emmy for bringing Mr. Monk back. And Hector Elizondo as Dr. Bell brought an unexpectedThe mystery (and the ""Here's what happened..."") will NOT disappoint. This was written and directed by people who love Monk, and it shows. Andy Breckman is TV mystery royalty, and let's everyone know it.Jeff Beal's score was one of my favorite parts of this- the ""Monk"" cues are there, but it's a new score now and not just a rehash of the original show soundtrack. His use of string instruments not only well up tears effectively, but he even brings in some Hitchcockian ethers that just hit the spot.I hope ""Mr. Monk's Last Case"" gets the recognition it deserves. It's a Monk mystery that ends up having so much more to say about Mr. Monk himself and our world today. Emphasizing just how emotional and realistic this movie got for me any further would include spoilers, so just make sure to keep some wipes handy.~abrown975 rated 9/10 on 8 December 2023"," Delighted to have Mr Monk back!: If you love Adrian Monk you're going to love his last case!

Trudy's daughter is set to be married & everyone has gathered for the joyous event! But, of course, wherever Mr Monk is murder seems to follow and this is no exception.The only drawback I can find with this movie is that it's only just over an hour and a half long.

My biggest complaint is the murder method was obvious at 32 minutes in. Second, the Monk type OCD scenes were played too long and just became tedious, slowing the plot. Third, Monk's death scene was absurd. You would think for an actual movie, they would have devised a much more intricate plot, especially considering the obvious cost and bring 2 actors out of retirement to reprise their roles. At the end it is a bit less interesting than the average Monk series episode, still enjoyable, like watching a lost episode or an alternate series finale. Maybe they'll reprise the series with better writers.~david_w_gibson rated 5/10 on 10 December 2023"," Tony Shalhoub steals the show, but this movie still left me unsatisfied...: The good: Tony Shalhoub's acting performance is great. As ever I must say, because this actor has got a special talent for playing characters who are ""masterful"" at fumbling things up, making a fool out of themselves, in such an endearing way that I can only sympathize with his characters. And this movie aint no different, although it looks and feels more like a television pilot than a real movie, which brings me to the bad...The bad: this movies' other actors are quite mediocre. And unfortunately they do get a lot of screentime and dialogue. It almost seems as if Tony Shalhoub got all the great lines and the other characters got only ""filler"" dialogue. The scenes with Tony Shalhoub were a delight to watch, but the many other scenes kinda bored me to be honest.Not terrible for certain, but not great either. It'll do as a nice pastime for those who are into slowburing, quirky, gentle detective stories.The story: Tony Shalhoub plays a neurotic detective, who visits his shrink frequently and who has got many kinds of fears. Despite all these hilariously looking shortcomings and witty scenes about his anxious outlook on his personal life he has to solve a murder case. Will he succeed or run back to his shrink asking for more pills and understanding?~imseeg rated 5/10 on 9 December 2023"," Wonderful!: As someone with a mild case of OCD myself, I loved Monk, the TV series. So I was delighted they made this movie and it does NOT disappoint. They brought back all the characters from the end of the series that we know and love - Capt. Stottlemeier, Randy Disher, Natalie, the psychiatrist. The sets are different but have the same look & feel. Tony Shaloub is fabulous as Monk. It's amazing how he creates this character - all the neurotic tweaks which are never overdone, but just enough to make you squirm, laugh & cry all at once. I just love the scenes in the publisher's office, the rocket cockpit, the interviews with the Villain, which is hilariously modelled after Jeff Bezos. The ending made me tear up. Just great entertainment. Wish there were more movies like this.~marimiller-82075 rated 9/10 on 8 December 2023", Basically a long episode of Monk: So I was pleased (and surprised) to see this pop up out of nowhere.If you are a fan of Monk then you will probably like this as it follows pretty much the same type of format as the TV show but with one (rather dark) overshadowing theme.Making this film so long after the series has its draw backs - there is a certain amount of exposition as people new to the show are caught up and the absence of other characters is explained.Once it gets going it is the normal cheesy detective show that I have grown to love so much.Having a longer run time doesn't really add much and there is nothing special about it being a film - but I am fine with that it is perfect as it is.This (as the title suggests) is a farewell show and it has a marked degree of poignancy.An extra star for pulling back the original cast.~thekarmicnomad rated 8/10 on 27 December 2023," Will always love Monk but...: I'm a die-hard Monk fan and eagerly awaited this movie. However, I was disappointed to see the depressive turn the writers took with Monk's character. As another reviewer wrote, I too would have loved to see Monk embracing how the world dealt with germs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Monk gleefully witnessing the world wearing masks, using sanitizers amd wipes would have been hilarious. It seemed as if the writers weren't aware of the subtle nuances that make Monk ""Monk"". All in all, It was an enjoyable hour and a half. I loved seeing the old crew back together but it definitely missed its mark.~carlasprattling rated 8/10 on 18 December 2023"," Monk's Last Case: A Case of Disappointment: Adrian Monk's long-awaited return sputters in ""Mr. Monk's Last Case,"" a movie that feels like a reheated episode of its origin show. The surrounding performances are bland, the plot predictable, and the atmosphere surprisingly sterile. The mystery itself is lacking the intricate twists and turns that once kept viewers glued. Monk's signature deductions feel phoned-in, and the supporting characters, including a thinly veiled Jeff Bezos parody, fail to spark any interest. Jokes fall flat, and the pacing plods along like a forgotten Tuesday night rerun.Visually, the film lacks the grit and charm of the original series, opting for a bland, made-for-TV aesthetic. While die-hard fans might find a shred of nostalgia in Shalhoub's iconic portrayal, ""Mr. Monk's Last Case"" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity. It's a pale shadow of its former self, leaving viewers yearning for the days when Monk's neuroses were genuinely thrilling, not just tired tropes.Overall, this was a disappointing reunion that fails to recapture the magic of the original series. Watch only if you're desperate for a Monk fix, and be prepared for a case of deja vu.Rating: 5-/10 (bellow average, not recommended)~akcenat rated 5/10 on 12 December 2023"

As the weekend progresses the clues about why they have been invited begin to unfold along with a sinister mystery."," A bad Agatha Christie knock off: This really was bad.Connections impossibly made, bad acting and I do mean bad. Mischa Barton was atrocious, missing her queues, and an upper class accent that kept slipping. This felt like a stage production and they forgot to update it to 2023 standards. A weak performance and terrible writing.None of the characters were likeable and none questioned their presence on the island. They even forgot that after discovering the first murder they sent the doctor to fetch help. And then he wouldn't search the dead body, poorly scripted rubbish.Technology far beyond what was available and why would a recluse need sound proof rooms and secret passages? He wouldn't.The nail was at the end when after realising the two characters who were just about getting it on were brother and sister. Oh well, lets be friends.....blech. And Mischa's character saying óh, I never had much use for money' this from a florist in a depressed 1920s? Give me a breakComplete rubbish and I gave it a two because apparently they managed to get funding for this........how? Avoid at all costs!~andrewrye-06535 rated 2/10 on 27 April 2023"," Budget Agatha Christie/Knives Out: At first this movie had all the hallmarks of a decent little detective mystery movie in the style of Knives Out or Mourder on the Orient express. It has a decent set up, a coherent plot, it establishes its characters and starts to build on their motives.Unfortunately, it then suffers from having a beginning, no middle and then ends. Why? Probably due to budget or talent or deadline. Who knows. But right until it had me hooked about an hour in, it started to move toward a conclusion and finished.It's a shame. Micha Barton was a surprise and the set up was good, so, half a film. Still, better than no film at all.~stevelivesey-37183 rated 5/10 on 30 April 2023"," Beautiful Disaster, Come for a Mystery Stay for the Chandeliers: So the acting in this flick is absolutely terrible but it certainly did not get any help from the writing. I am a life long fan of Agatha Christie and other mystery authors, as well as some film noir and I'm a little crazy about giallos. I also love a good mystery-comedy like the 1985 classic, Clue: The Movie with Tim Curry and Madeline Kahn. I would go as far as to say that Clue is one of my top five favorite films of all time. I thought more recent films like Knives Out and See How They Run were both fun and entertaining, while not being up to my highest standards. BUT THIS....did a teenager write this screenplay as fan fiction or what?Casting a middle aged woman as the obnoxious but lovable, brilliant Hercule Poirot in a skirt could have worked. Could have. An older, curvier Mischa Barton can't plod through movies on her youthful glamorous looks anymore - she's borderline unrecognizable as an average, curvy blonde of about 40 - but that's not the problem: she can't act.At bottom it is the writing that is terrible, though, that much is clear by the multiple caricatures which should be delightful and funny but just end up coming across as wooden and ridiculous.There is a enormous dark house with chandeliers, and I do love a nice pair of vintage curtains.~thalassafischer rated 5/10 on 24 June 2023"," A very un-English murder ""mystery"": Set in England (or a small island just off the coast) however none of this movie feels like England, which isn't surprising considering it was filmed in the U. S. Even lacking English accents (accurate ones, anyway), and awkwardly including American idioms throughout (e.g. English police do not carry guns). An uninteresting mystery with an unlikable protagonist and a rather boring conclusion. It sets itself up as the potential first in a series of movies starring the same amateur sleuth, but I will not be interested in anything that follows. It is nothing like the Agatha Christie mysteries it is trying to emulate, and it leaves a rather unpleasant taste, so I'm off to watch something starring David Suchet to cleanse my palate.~rykskelton rated 3/10 on 28 April 2023"," A very cheap Agatha Christie rip off: The movie is probably inspired by ""And then there were none"" by Agatha Christie in its set up.But from there it's all too predictable and the actors are terrible.The plot is as weak as the cast. The loop holes in the story are legion.I love the whodunnit kind of movies but this is so depressing bad ... so bad that I cried for the time spend watching this crap, minutes of my life that were lost and that I won't get back.The most positive part of the movie was the single expression ""the end"".Please save yourself the depression of watching this poor spectacle of what could have been a decent movie.~mindoscp rated 2/10 on 29 April 2023"," Enjoyable enough murder mystery.: Six strangers receive invites to the home of Millionaire Lewis Findley, when they arrive their host is absent, they anxiously wait to learn their purpose for being there.The first couple of minutes all seemed to point to one thing, a reworking of And then there were none, the ultimate Whodunnit, we had the strangers, the island, the invitations, that's where the similarities end.Let's be honest, it's nonsense, but if you are fan of mysteries and whodunnits, you may just get some enjoyment out of it, there are some interesting moments, and the story has a few clever ideas.For me, it had the look and feel of a stage play, entertaining enough, maybe a little rough around the edges at times.The accents are a little hit and miss, and at no point does it feel as though it's England, I've not checked the production details, but I'm assuming The States or Canada.Mischa Barton does a fine job, more Fletcher than Marple, but pleasing enough. Chris Browning stole the show for me, I enjoyed his performance.6/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 6/10 on 25 December 2023"," So bad: The acting is decidedly absolutely awful in this boring mish mash of a ripped off Agatha Christie story. The script is boring and lacklustre, the dialogue overstated and precarious, but what makes this film even worse is the dreadful attempt at accents. Once again little to no character development. I find the blocking of the actors in some scenes really unimaginative, they just stand in a line and recite their lines almost robot like. It's a shame as they have some nice locations and sets, but nothing special enough to warrant sitting through what potentially could have been quite an exciting and thrilling movie had it been taken up by better screenwriters and a more skilled and imaginative director. Don't waste your time on this one.~CineviewUK rated 1/10 on 5 June 2023"," I wish I hadn't RSVPed.: I am shocked this terrible movie was made. The plot, acting, writing, costumes were terrible and pedestrian. Some of the accents made my ears bleed. One accent was a very painful affectation and reminded me of Dick van Dyke in ""Mary Poppins."" (Yep, I do know MB is British.) I truly hope this movie doesn't become a made-for-television series.The lead character was too clever for her own good without an ounce of humility or likability. Hercule Poirot she isn't. Heck, she isn't even Hetty Winthrop.Do yourself a favor and skip this pile of rubbish. Turn to the original if you want to watch a program of intelligent detectives solving murders: Agatha Christie.~lexingtonvintage rated 1/10 on 29 April 2023"," liked two thirds: Miranda Green (Mischa Barton) is a florist in 30's England. She is skilled in observing and is obsessed with murder mystery books especially those of Agatha Christie. She receives a mysterious invitation from unknown textile tycoon Lord Findley. She joins five other guests on a passenger train to his island estate. There are three staff members but Lord Findley is apparently late in arriving. Soon, Miranda gets her murder mystery to solve.I liked about two thirds of this movie. It has the Agatha Christie feel. Initially, the main problem is its artificial tone. It doesn't help that these people are going to this place for nothing more than curiosity. Miranda would do it, but only one other seems to have the motivation. It's a murder mystery whodunnit. It's fun. Then the last section tries to solve the mystery quickly and randomly. I don't like a lot of the last third. In the age of streaming, this needs more time and this could be two or three part series. In an aside, I did not recognize Mischa Barton. I assumed that she's some random English actress.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 26 August 2023", Quite dull: A bit slow and plodding with some questionable acting and some atrocious attempts at acents. The script writing is somewhat lacking and the there's not much of a plot. By the time the titles roll at the ninety minute mark it feels like it's been half an hour too long. The characters are all a bit wooden and the actors seemed to be simply going through the motions. None of them seemed to engage with their character and I couldn't engage with them either.Has a made for TV feel to it and I would strongly suggest it's not worth going to the cinema to see.It's not terrible but it's not good either. If you're really bored then maybe give it a whirl.~duncan-wallbank rated 5/10 on 26 April 2023

The storyline follows an isolated 1950s community where the men go to work and the women stay home and clean and cook every day. Jack and Alice are the next hot couple on the rise where Jack is rising within his employer and Alice is rising within the social classes. When her best friend loses her minds and starts revealing things about the community, Alice starts realizing something isn't quiet right also.This picture is directed by and stars Olivia Wilde (Booksmart) and also stars Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Harry Styles (Dunkirk), Chris Pine (Star Trek), KiKi Layne (If Beale Street Could Talk) and Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians).The storyline for this picture reminded me of a mix of Stepford Wives, Wanda Vision and Logan's Run. The premise has a lot of potential and was set up well; however, the movie doesn't unfold as well or intensely as I would have liked it to. The cinematography, attire, look and feel was perfect. The casting fit the premise well. Pine was a tremendous ""villain."" I even liked the subplots and backstory...but something feels a bit lacking the entire movie. While some of the dramatic scenes didn't work for me (the Saran Wrap scene and the face against the windows sequences), I will say from the discovery of what's going on through the end was entertaining and well executed.Overall, this is one of those movies where the entire film it feels like it's missing something. You can't put your finger on it; but whatever ""it"" is, this is missing ""it."" I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 23 September 2022"," Truly Style Over Substance: The Good: I have to give credit where it's due; Don't Worry Darling is a fun, daring movie with some great attributes. The performances, particularly by Florence Pugh and Chris Pine, are honestly great. Styles does surprisingly well too, being a compelling and interesting character. He and Pugh have great physical chemistry - even if it doesn't seem to go much beyond that - and I can see how their scenes perhaps, um...led to tension of set (if you know the story behind this movie, you'll get what I mean).This movie looks fantastic. Victory, the fictional desert oasis this film takes place in, is a gorgeous little 1950s inspired American suburb; the costumes, the food, the houses, they all look great and you'd be forgiven to for seeing the appeal of a place like it. There are some scenes that look so good, I almost wanted them to go on longer just to spend a little more time in these places (i.e. The dance hall, the clubhouse). One thing I've noticed in 2022 is that we're beginning to see technology, technique, and will come together, producing some of the most beautiful looking films I've seen in years come out. For all its problems, Don't Worry Darling is shot very well and looks very expensive.The Bad: Unfortunately, Don't Worry Darling falls flat where storytelling is concerned. It's one of those movies that makes sense in hindsight - you can see the breadcrumbs the movie leaves that hints to the ultimate conclusion.It's not particularly surprising, but it is an interesting idea. While I'm happy the film was more subtle than I'd imagine, it would've been nice to interrogate and explore the themes and ideas the film raises. There are way too many redundant hallucinations that take up too much time. We don't get a sense of how anything in this world happens, we don't get a lot of context on the other people in Victory, how the program works etc.I don't think films need to over explain every aspect of their story. Some things can be let up to interpretation or ambiguous. But I have to wonder why so much of this film feels like it's treading water until the big reveal? Not much truly happens for a bulk of it. It's a shame, because Pugh really gives it her all as Alice, but she's a pretty hollow character despite all the time we spend with her.The Ugly: I'd describe Don't Worry Darling as Stepford Wives + The Matrix + The Truman Show + Pleasantville. It wears its inspirations on its sleeves, it's not close to those films in terms of quality, but I can appreciate the attempt.Also, I love a movie with good food scenes and this one ticks that box. Have a big bag of popcorn ready if you're going to watch.~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 5/10 on 24 September 2022"," Builds intrigue, then wastes it: Olivia Wilde's second directorial effort is nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be given the firestorm of behind-the-scenes drama and production troubles. But it's also just not nearly as interesting or as well-put-together as it ought to be given it's fierce, original, thrilling premise.It's a sleek-looking production, and Wilde does some very smooth work behind the camera. Most of the performances are extremely good (especially Florence Pugh's), but some of the supporting cast does put a little too much ham into their work.Despite some clunky dialogue that consists largely of repetitive empty platitudes, the story is able to build a lot of intrigue with its intelligent placement of bizarre happenings. It causes its audience to ask questions and tests their patience by withholding and bestowing information in just the right doses.This intrigue lasts for the first two acts, although the film's character development unfortunately falls to the wayside because the mystery was given all the attention.It's a shame, because the third act and final twists of the story make all the nuance and complexity of the mysterious characters and world-building slip away.At the film's conclusion, I was left dissatisfied. Dissatisfied with the fact that the villains' motivations were oversimplified to the point that their actions no longer make much sense.It's like they deliberately planned to go about achieving their goals in the most convoluted, difficult way possible and in a way that would make them the most vulnerable that they could possibly be. It's a laughable ending with hilariously half-baked twists.Don't Worry Darling is one of those movies that's bursting with imaginative, intriguing ideas, but never quite finds a way to put them together in a satisfying, coherent way. It's messy and not particularly satisfying as a result.~benjaminskylerhill rated 5/10 on 23 September 2022"," I had such hope for this: This is the movie I was looking forward to most all year. I avoided all the behind the scenes drama and press surrounding it so that I would enjoy the movie for the movie itself because I was so excited purely based on the cast alone, plus the soundtrack too after hearing Ooogum Boogum song by Brenton Wood in one of the teasers. It starts off showing us this perfect life, too perfect so you have this too good to be true feeling and know that something's amiss throughout. It gave off 60's American dream life in the suburb's vibes.Chris Pine really catches your attention with his charisma the way he speaks every time he's on screen, but he's not saying anything of actual substance. And that's how the whole movie feels, very captivating and pretty to look at, visually stunning; Olivia Wilde did a great job, well produced and has artistic direction but it all feels empty. The writing falls flat and it's hallow. Someone said Chris Pine is used to disguise mediocre movies after 'All the Old Knives' and I'm starting to see it, he just makes movies seem better than they really are. Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh did good, with Harry Styles doing as good as you'd expect.Slow paced so it has a lot of suspense, arousing questions all movie long and when they finally start getting answered it's too little too late; the reveal is not big enough to justify the wait. It was an ambitious attempt and showing of Wilde's ability but ultimately underwhelming. It's just about better than mediocre with everything it does right but other aspects of the movie can't put it beyond a 6/10. Just feels like it's missing something. Not as bad as the press around it was, nor as good as those who were hopeful for it thought it was going to be.~AfricanBro rated 6/10 on 23 September 2022"," The good kind of weird: As usual, I went into this movie knowing nothing, without watching any trailers. And as usual, I had a great time as I slowly learned what the movie is about. This is such a weird and cool movie. It's creepy and haunting but not in a horror kind of way. The story is fully intriguing.I love the way it was directed. I kept wondering who it was, thinking it would be a director I'm already familiar with. But I was surprised to find out it was Olivia Wilde. Not sure if this is her directorial debut but I think she did a great job.Florence Pugh is ultra-talented. I already knew this, especially after Midsommar. But she again reinforces it with numerous scenes where she conveys her emotions so well that I can feel them with her. She's a rockstar.There are a few parts where it feels slow. And there were times when I felt like I wanted more. But I really enjoyed what I was given and had an overall great time with this movie. (1 viewing, opening Friday Dolby Cinema 9/23/2022)~FeastMode rated 7/10 on 24 September 2022"," I hope Wilde is paying for Florence's chiropractor bills for carrying the whole entire movie: The concept of the movie was good, but needed to be taken a bit further in my opinion with detail. A lot happens in the movie that basically requires the audience to accept without question.Over explained movies are obviously no fun, but this one just left me annoyed because in two hours, I feel like they could have done a lot more.Florence Pugh gives an amazing performance. If anyone has seen Midsommar, they would be aware that she knows how to give an emotional performance with or without supporting leads. She is the body and soul of this movie and it would be a complete disappointment without her.Pugh made the movie interesting, but the writing and directing did not excel in the movie. The cinematography was wonderful and there was some great acting from some people and that's about it.~atkin-91266 rated 5/10 on 24 September 2022"," Felt like a women's verson of Get Out (wish I like it as much): I have to admit I went into this film with low expectations. I go to the movies enough that I've been watching the trailer to this flick for almost a year now. Seriously, out of all the flicks I saw this year no film has made me wait as long snice the time I saw the trailer back in the spring. At this point I just needed to see what it was all about.I came out of this movie liking it. At first, I thought it was dull and mundane as we went through this woman's life. Maybe that's what Oliva Wayde was going for as I'm sure the movie was filled with less obvious metaphors that I did not understand or even wanted to, honestly.It was a mystery and when the mystery was revealed I have to stay I was quite satisfied with the end results. The fact that this mystery dropped clues that did not actually lead to solving the puzzle but in fact made a bigger puzzle did not weigh too heavy on how much I like where the movie went. It was worth all the superficial fluff.I could be missing the depth of it because the film was not directed to me, but there were certain parts that reminded me of Get Out and the empathy made it an exciting experience overall.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 24 September 2022"," A film beyond expectations....: 7.5/10This my attempt to #dontspoilitdarlingFirst, my preconceived notions of the film. I thought this film would be entertaining, but lack real excitement and chaos. I thought the trailer had spoiled a significant chunk of what would happen.That being said, I had the utmost pleasure of attending a pre-screening for ""Don't Worry Darling"" during an IMAX Live event, and my hopes had kind of plummeted with some of the casts answers to questions. However, I feel that I was slightly mis-directed.This film was entertaining for myself. It's not a heavy psychological thriller, but it has a few elements that made feel uneasy. As some of the cast stated, there is more to this film than meets the eye. We were told don't blink, and listen.Florence Pugh's acting was tremendous. Similar to ""Midsommar"" she knows how to make the daytime feel uneasy. The rest of the cast was good, but perhaps because they're not as centralized as Florence.Cinematography wasn't spectacular, but it did a great job of holding attention, and earning its tension. The score definitely added to that, as well. The music was perfectly suited for the film even after I listened to it for an hour leading to the start of the film.Truly, the story was very interesting up until the reveal took place, at which point the film slightly loses momentum. However, I still wasn't sure if it would end as I thought, but it definitely didn't end as I had hoped. There's a few things I think I would've liked to see differently, and maybe even have the film lengthened to two and a quarter hours to not have everything so rushed.Overall, very good cinematography with great acting by Florence Pugh. The story isn't as psychological as I would've hoped for, but still makes the daytime feel slightly uneasy. If you can see it in IMAX it's definitely worth it, however, just seeing it in theatres is worthwhile.Lastly, I don't know much about her, but I feel people are going to hate on this film just because Olivia Wilde is associated it, and I don't think that's deserving. However, I'll leave that up for you to decide.Thank you for reading this very long review. I hope it gives you insight to the film without spoiling it. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!~PerryAtTheMovies rated 7/10 on 20 September 2022"," Florence Pugh!!!: To quote Harry Styles, ""This movie feels like a movie, like a real movie. Like a 'go out to the theatre' film movie."" Without poking too much fun at Styles' interview skills - he's right! This is a movie you should see in theatres that I quite enjoyed! While it doesn't fully live up to the promise of its incredible trailers, it surely is a compelling, engaging film and another fantastic work from Olivia Wilde. However, the true standout from this film is Florence Pugh, who deserves all the praise she will receive for her performance here. She is incredible and really shows off her range as an actress, I couldn't get enough of her in this movie! She was absolutely phenomenal and even if you don't like the movie, I assure you that you will love Florence Pugh in it! She truly carries the film, and right from the start you are fully enveloped in her character's conflicts and story. Pugh commands the screen in every scene that she is in - which is pretty much the entire film... one could say she really is the element that holds the film together! If you are a Florence Pugh fan, you'll be in heaven... and if you aren't... you will be by the time the movie is over!The rest of the ensemble cast is wonderful here too! Pugh is definitely the standout, but I really loved Chris Pine's performance here too. He has this suave but menacing persona in it, and makes it very hard for you to get a read on what was going through his character's head. And can I just say... they made Pine look really good in this role, his costuming and hair was PERFECT. I also didn't mind Harry Styles, he was good especially considering he doesn't have much acting experience. It was a little hard to take him seriously in some dramatic scenes... but it seemed like he was really trying his best! And if he brought an audience into this film, that's a win. The rest of the cast was great too, it was an awesome ensemble and Olivia Wilde got some great performances out of her actors. She gave a good performance herself in a supporting role, but her direction is the most notable! I liked ""Booksmart"", but this is a huge step up for her! It is much larger in scale and deals with a lot more complex themes, which Wilde weaves into the film so organically. There is so much attention to detail and an expert use of symbolism to convey themes of control. I loved the aesthetic she brought to the film as well, from the stunning 50s production design and costumes (I loved these) to the phenomenal cinematography. It had this Hollywood high gloss feel to it, and yet had a number of avant-garde qualities that actually worked so well for the film! The film is evocatively shot, and I was amazed at some of the clever ways the cinematographer and Wilde chose to capture certain moments. And I can't mention the technical excellence of the film without mentioning the haunting and disturbing sound design. It worked so well for the film, really setting the tone in such a strong way and playing off the amazing 50s soundtrack the film had! Every beat is felt throughout your body and draws you further into the mayhem ensuing on screen. And the editing was exceptional too, especially in helping to reveal things to the audience without having to expressly tell us. The film's technical merit is impressive right from the very start, and I give all credit to Wilde for this in her excellent sophomore effort.This movie is the type of movie we don't normally see these days, and it was quite refreshing. It definitely takes inspiration from other stories and films, such as ""The Stepford Wives"", and was even reminiscent of ""WandaVision"", but it manages to put a clever enough spin on these ideas that makes the film as a whole feel more original. Some ideas and elements did feel somewhat half-baked, but the film still did a lot to make them feel more natural and developed within the film! The story itself was right up my alley, it dove right into the mystery right at the beginning and sucked me in within seconds of the movie starting. It has a tight, gripping script with a fantastic twist at the end! Sure, it may be predictable but they put a unique enough spin on it that made it really work for me, I loved the 3rd act! It definitely won't be for everyone, and it depends how believable you find elements related to the twist. But it really came together for me in the end; I was on the edge of my seat and my eyes were wide! The story and ultimately the movie may not be as good as that first trailer promised it would be, if they did one more pass of the script it really could have been perfect, but what we got was still awesome!The film is thrilling and at times filled me with dread. It is an excellent (and somewhat erotic) psychological thriller that just worked so well for me! The script is definitely not its strongest component, and in less inspired hands this film could have fallen flat. However, due to Olivia Wilde's strong vision for the film and well-rounded technical strength, exquisite sound and visuals the film bolsters... it actually works! And the cast was incredible too! While it does feature plenty of star power, one thing is for sure, this is Florence Pugh's world and we are all just living in it. This is one of her best performances to date, she elevates this movie to an exceptional level. Her effortless dedication to every element of her performance is impressive, especially considering the on-set drama that may or may not have happened. It is unfortunate the drama has taken focus off the film, but I do hope audiences still go out to experience this great film! Everything came together to create a really solid film that I just ate right up, it worked perfectly for me! And I can't wait to rewatch it!~parksiet rated 8/10 on 24 September 2022"," A VERY SLOW BURN SLEEPER: I was anticpating the release of this movie not due to all the in-fighting drama about the cast which fueled the fire for online gossip but more about Olivia Wilde directing and Florence Pugh a very underrated actress. The rest of the cast is just decoration with Harry Styles replacing Shia LaBeouf which was a major mistake.The premise is Alice and Jack Chambers are a young, happy couple in the 1950s, living in the seemingly perfect company town of Victory, California, which has been created and paid for by the mysterious company for which Jack works. Curiosity about the nature of her husband's work on the secret ""Victory Project"" begins to consume Alice. Cracks then begin to form in their utopian life as her investigation into the project raises tensions within the community.The beginning of the movie I thought Oh God another Stepford Wives but as it progressed it sort of got interesting with a surprise ending that had me asking is that all there is?~rkeilitz-19-537915 rated 2/10 on 22 September 2022"

It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.As for me, while this isn't the sort of film I normally would watch, it's one I decided to see because it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. He's an actor who takes lots of risks and has appeared in many unique films which I enjoyed, such as ""Source Code"", ""Nightcrawler"", and ""Donnie Darko"". In fact, I cannot think of any conventional movies he's made...and you know you're in for a few surprises when you see his films...and this definitely is no exception.The story begins with two families having a dinner party. However, partway through the evening, the parents notice that the two youngest kids are gone. Where could they be?! The search the neighborhood but find no trace. The only clue is a tenuous one...a beat up RV was seen parked nearby.The police soon locate the RV and the driver. Instead of exiting the vehicle when the police order him out, he tries to run and is soon apprehended. It seems very likely the guy knows SOMETHING but since there's no real evidence, the police are forced to let him go. Unfortunately, the father of one of the abducted girls (Hugh Jackman) isn't going to let this go....and he abducts the man and keeps him prisoner...trying to get information from him. This portion is not for the squeamish.In the meantime, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) has found leads on two other suspects. One is a priest with a corpse in his basement. Another is a freak who likes to buy childrens' clothing and who was first noticed at a vigil for the girls. He won't talk but keeps drawing mazes for the police....mazes that look like the necklace found on the corpse...and mazes which were mentioned by the man in captivity to his captor! All three are obsessed with mazes...so what has this to do with the missing girls?!The best thing about this film is that the screenplay is impossible to predict. If anyone tells you they could predict it, they're lying! Seriously! I appreciate a film that keeps me guessing and this one sure did. As for the acting, with Jackman and Gyllenhaal it's of course excellent. Overall, an amazing film...and an amazingly hard one to watch as well. It's certainly NOT for the squeamish!~planktonrules rated 10/10 on 7 September 2021"," More than just one meaning: If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013~kosmasp rated 10/10 on 2 June 2014"," Hard to Watch but Really Well Done: Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who ""prays for the best but expects the worst."" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.~Hitchcoc rated 9/10 on 24 April 2017"," ""Finish all the mazes and you can go home."": I didn't realize until I came to some of the reviews for this movie that it was two and a half hours long. It didn't seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed in the story that time manages to fly by pretty quickly.I thought the plotting for the film was nearly flawless. The one thing I found exception to was when Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhaal) got distracted by the phone call from the department store clerk, he left Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) in the abandoned house and never bothered to return in a timely fashion. He had pretty good instincts about something going on there, so a quicker follow up would have been expected.Otherwise, I thought the screenplay and director Denis Villeneuve crafted an intricately weaved mystery surrounding the missing girls, with an abduction history going back a quarter of a decade. Those who find Keller's kidnapping of Alex Jones (Paul Dano) distasteful and his subsequent beating of Alex brutal, I'd have to agree that it was beyond the pale for a movie treatment. The beating part anyway. You could understand the man's frustration, but having no success in getting any information, he should have backed off long before he did.But even that part of it was handled well. Loki conceded to Grace Dover (Maria Bello) that her husband would probably go to jail, so there was no getting around the idea that Keller would get away with what he did. For his part, Gyllenhaal displayed another nuanced character in Detective Loki, just about a hundred eighty degree turn from his depiction of news gatherer Lou Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"". There were times he showed remarkable restraint dealing with Keller, making me think about the way cops in real life situations have to hold back on their emotions when dealing with distraught victims of a crime. He and the rest of the supporting cast put in very credible performances.~classicsoncall rated 9/10 on 28 November 2017"," Wonderful Mystery That Keeps You Guessing Till the End: Prisoners (2013) **** (out of 4) Incredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl's father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn't anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That's certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what's the best performance I've seen from him. This isn't your ""loving"" father in the traditional sense. Instead he's someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can't support what he's doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn't know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you're watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn't going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can't find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what's going on. I can't say I agreed with all the choices but it's great that a film actually makes you think as that's something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn't exactly an ""enjoyable"" film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding.~Michael_Elliott rated NA on 21 November 2013"," One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.: ""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his ""less is more"" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied~Diablo1616 rated 8/10 on 27 March 2020"," a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller: Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html~YJLcool rated 8/10 on 22 September 2013"," 'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...: There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the ""X-Men"" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like ""Jarhead"" and ""Zodiac"" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in ""The Master"" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow"" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one ""scene"" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in ""Prisoners"" is cut and clear their best they've offered.""Prisoners"" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.~ClaytonDavis rated 8/10 on 17 September 2013"," A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense: This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.~Potty-Man rated 10/10 on 20 September 2013"," Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic: Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com~gregsrants rated 8/10 on 9 September 2013"

Not real horror, but more of a psychological mindbender.The bad: it doesnt really get scary or thrilling. It gets weird allright.The good: decent acting in a incredibly weird mindbending script.Not suited for casual viewers.~imseeg rated NA on 29 May 2022"," Meandering is right: MIDSOMMAR is the latest film from arthouse director Ari Aster, whose HEREDITARY wowed audiences a few years ago. While I liked that film I didn't love it, but I do love folk horror and THE WICKER MAN so I expected a lot from this one. Sadly, I didn't get it. MIDSOMMAR is a real mixed bag of a movie, with a decent first half. Florence Pugh gives a fine performance and the opening sequence is particularly powerful, getting off to a good footing. The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film.~Leofwine_draca rated 5/10 on 15 March 2020"," Midsommar murders.: Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first.~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 1 December 2019"," A surreal, but pretty awesome trip.: Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.Very good. 8/10~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 13 August 2019"," Not for everyone: Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.~schuelererik rated 4/10 on 31 May 2020"," How can something so f-ed up be so beautiful: It is worth saying upfront that MidSommar should be a very divisive movie. If you tend to watch mostly popular movies or standard horror films, Midsommar is not for you.Which explains the amount of 1 out of 10 reviews here on IMDb, despite an overall 7.1 rating.But if you don't mind a slow building narrative with tension, innovative cinematography and plenty of look-away gore, then you might be able to appreciate just how unique Midsommar really is.Briefly - MidSommar shows us a group of friends going on what seems like an idyllic trip to the Midsummer festival in a village in Northern Sweden. But that quickly turns into a harrowing display of Pagan rituals and ceremonies.The movie is long because it's not afraid to take its time explaining the background of the characters (the group of friends and particularly the young woman in which it focuses). So from the start you can feel that this will be a different experience from most horror films.But the movie really takes off once they arrive in Sweden. And it goes a long way to explain why Ari Aster is being so buzzed as a new director. Some of the shots shown are, at least in my book, completely outside the norm. And early on help you involve in the world of the film, and in the experience of the main characters.In the terms of cinematography, it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. And that becomes an even more impressive achievement because of its contrast with the horrid gore images displayed throughout the movie.The grass's green, the floral arrangements, the group dances, everything really paints a picturesque image of the Midsommar festivities. Despite all the unexpected events the characters are witnessing, that sense is kept all throughout 2h30 of film.All of the imagery helped me, as a viewer, to truly feel in the perspective of the characters. Walking into the festival, hopeful, experience the shock of everything that happens in front of them.I felt I too went on that trip with the characters, and I was shocked again and again together with them. It stuck with me for hours on end after watching. Which is one the best complements I can make to the work of a director in my view.Truly recommended it if you are up to watching a different yet aesthetically beautiful piece of cinema.~manuel_medeiros rated 8/10 on 27 April 2020"," 3 hours not worth: It's unusual horror but the unusual is nothing special, too long and waste of time and most important is not horrific at all.~ks-60500 rated 3/10 on 3 October 2019"," 'You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!' (Hotel California): I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, not my wife's type of movie.This was made by the same writer/director that brought us ""Hereditary"" a year earlier, I like this one much more. It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours.~TxMike rated NA on 4 December 2019"," This movie was a trip: I'm not sure how but the movie had me on edge the entire time. You have to enjoy cinematography to really enjoy this. I left the movie like I just came down from a high. The whole thing felt like a bad trip afterwards, I was pleased and not at the same time but I think that's how we're meant to feel. It's a good change from super hero movies and terribly made horror movies.~palistineroyal rated 7/10 on 6 July 2019"," Self-indulgent, pretentious piece of garbage: This is basically a hipster version of ""Wicker Man"", only overly long, pretentious and with highly unlikable characters.Don't look for any hidden meanings, it's all pretty much on the nose, but it's dealt with a lot of pretense and utterly boring. Of course it's celebrated by half-intellectual wannabe film critics, a true product of our time.Now, I wouldn't say that it's incompetently made, though. It has some nice shots, maybe even an interesting premise, but it ultimately fails by being unable to draw you in and by having an astounding upside-down moral view on things. I was appalled at how this film handles the evualuation of its characters' actions, the implausible reactions and the overall conclusion. That's why it is unbelievable, preachy and downright annoying. Add the unnecessary runtime of 148 minutes, and you'll find yourself wishing to have done something more sensible instead of watching this - for example getting drunk and wetting yourself in a puddle of your own puke.~IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews rated 2/10 on 2 September 2020"
