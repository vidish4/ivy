Duffy|Jena Malone,Zack Snyder,Zack Snyder|Kurt Johnstad|Shay Hatten,"When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival."," Nothing original here: I think Zack Snyder didn't really do much research into this one. Maybe it's because it's a Netflix thing, I am not sure. There's so much borrowing from several other popular movies that I just wasn't invested in the story because it was all tooo basic and predictable.You had the Thanos and Gamora moment in there, you are the Starwars Resistance vs The First Order moment in there. You had the Darthvader type figure in there. You had the Kylo Ren character in there. And the worlds looked like something from a Starwars episode.Also the whole story was just weak, too weak for a director like Zack. I mean we've seen it done so many times from Lord of the Rings, to Game of Thrones, to even The Avengers. You are threatened by a bigger force, so you go around recruiting people to help you fight this force. That's basically it. There wasn't any rich subplot like we see in eg. Dune. Just very basic.Does it warrant a part 2, I strongly don't think it did. It's lazy writing and directing and shouldn't be encouraged.All in all, it's an ok movie. It's not bad like some reviews are saying. The effects are spot on, I loved the cinematography. The only drawbacks for me were the weak storyline, the awful fight sequence, the casting could have been better and the all too familiar scenes.~therealjaysmoke rated 6/10 on 28 December 2023"," Embarrassingly bad: Imagine you're a twelve year old boy, having watched some cool movies for the first time five minutes ago, having your bootleg toys of popular franchises and smashing them together in dirt saying ""and then"" every couple of minutes. Now imagine you get tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to make that a movie.Now imagine that being better than this.I thought Sucker Punch was bad. This is somehow worse.Below average acting, uninteresting characters, worldbuilding hastily slapped from who knows how many better franchises, including WH40K, Star Wars, World War II, Kurosawa, probably some anime and much more.Visually I would describe this as ""vulgar"", an ocular insult. And so much slo-mo, it's just silly. It just looks and feels bad, atmosphere is equal to a junkyard.Villains are so bad, heroes are no better. I get Netflix does what Netflix do, making bad expensive movies, that people watch. But this is insane.I want to make something very clear - it might look like a good movie, it is not. You shouldn't watch this and promote this. Ask better for your money.~Smarmelade rated 2/10 on 22 December 2023"," The rating is objective: The biggest problem of the movie is the plot. It is just bad. And not just the main storyline which makes little sense and the villains are comedic, but almost every interaction ends up with the viewer asking ""but, why?"" or ""how does it even make sense?"".The assembly of heroes (what the movie is about) is also rushed as hell, and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely.As for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It's not like they are even hiding.Next, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can't penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it's absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.The acting is ok, but it's difficult to judge the actors if they do good because the script tells them to follow an unnatural character arc in the first place. I'd say Sofia played Kora well, but Kora is just a poor character which is out of place in the very story she's central.It's not all bad. The picture is nice.I'd say it's the most disappointing Snyder's movie so far.~Dimakovtun rated 5/10 on 24 December 2023"," Everything you've seen done before, blended together, with a scoop of mud: A purely visual spectacle, and not even a great one at that, hidden behind a muddy filter.Every scene is farcically derivative of Star Wars, Battle Beyond the Stars, Warhammer 40K, Turok, and many other, better sources.Boutella just isn't credible leading lady material, characters are zero dimensional points, it's gratingly expositional, and the action scenes are comically ineptly choreographed, burdened with jump-cuts and slow-slow-slower-motion.The plot is a series of ""And then, and then, and then"" fetch-quests that seem like an episodic TV show, crammed into a badly edited 2 1/4 hours that feels much longer. And it ends with a jarringly pointless ""To be continued"".But... why, film, why? Why continue?~RogerBorg rated 3/10 on 30 December 2023"," I just want good sci-fi: I wanted this to be good so badly. Like really badly.Other than the world design and effects, there really isn't much else to salvage from it.In true Snyder style we've got lens flare and slow motion, but this time he's dialled it up over the top.Some of the action scenes are absolutely ruined from way too much diving in and out of slow motion.The biggest disappointment is the writing.The first 70% of the film is absolutely a waste of time and not needed.You don't find out most of the characters actual relevance until the back end of the film.Everything before that is a mixture of utterly pointless painfully boring scenes done for the sole purpose of filler.Looks great, but that's all.~BlockLike rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Well...: Well, after reading some of the reviews I sort of braced for impact. But it was not as bad as I expacted. True, the acting is well... lets say errr... below par. But so was the acting in the first Starwars movies to be honest. The graphics where above par, way beyond to my surprise. Does this make up for the not-thrar-good acting? Nope. But it eases the pain. Do I care that it has a lot in common with the original, with Starwars? Hmmm... a bit, bit not so much that I bothered to be honest. This movie is good enough on its own. Give it a chance and watch it without your mind made up already. You might end up liking it.~meelaleks rated 7/10 on 31 December 2023"," Something wrong with the writing, dialogue, and acting/directing: As an other reviewer wrote, there are wooden language, wooden expressions and wooden dialogue.The first ting I noticed in the movie was the words the actors spoke seemed like they had been written by a teenager... so many pointless words.Then there where the actors speaking the words, they just seemed wierd and emotionless.Then there are the action scenes. There are a lot of them, and they could have been really good. But the editing are just a bunch of normal speed, slow speed clipping to make it look good, and the bad guys just stand still doing nothing while the ""hero"" spends minutes moving around in the open...CGI/Greenscreen galore.. but very well done. So this is perhaps the strongest part of the movie.Waisted and nonsense slowmo sections... there are so many of them... and they are so pointless and gives nothing to the movie. There are movies and directors that know how to use slow motion sequences in a movie, and then there are this movie and director, that did not take that class... it's just a waist of time.In summary, if you are able to ignore all the writing, dialogue, acting/directing issues... its a passable scifi action movie.The movie could have been so much better, because there is a decent enough story underneath.. and they obviously had enough money to do what they wanted...I'm assuming Netflix payed for this. So I'm guessing that there where a big payday for writer/director and no requirements for quality on the delivered product. So they just cut from the budget anyone that could have given the director feedback on the uality issues.~bjjao rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," So close,Yet so far: Ah, the bittersweet symphony of ""Rebel Moon."" I hear you there, fellow traveler to Pandora and Tatooine. We can both appreciate Zack Snyder's stylistic flourishes - the slow-mo ballet of violence, the operatic landscapes, the characters carved from myth. But as the curtain falls on ""Part One,"" a mournful sigh escapes. This could have been a glorious space opera, a love letter to sci-fi's golden age, yet it stumbles over familiar tropes and squanders its vast potential.Snyder's fingerprints are all over the screen. The visuals are undeniable - gargantuan spaceships casting ominous shadows, crimson blades carving through darkness, desert vistas whispering forgotten empires. He paints with a grand brush, but the canvas starts to feel repetitive. We've seen the grizzled warrior with a troubled past, the damsel in distress with hidden fire, the villain who chews scenery like it's his birthright. It's a well-worn costume rack, and while Snyder drapes it with his signature flair, the threads of originality begin to fray.The plot, a familiar melody of rebellion against tyranny, starts strong but loses its harmonic richness. Characters, instead of complex chords, become predictable arpeggios. Their motivations are thinly veiled, their backstories a rushed montage. The dialogue, meant to resonate like thunder, echoes with the hollowness of recycled sci-fi cliches.What hurts most is the unrealized potential. The glimpses of a deeper world, the whispers of ancient powers, the seeds of a nuanced conflict - all wither in the harsh glare of action sequences. Snyder loves his spectacle, and ""Rebel Moon"" is awash in it, but spectacle alone can't sustain a film. We crave emotion, depth, resonance. We want to be swept away, not merely bombarded.So, as the credits roll, a bittersweet symphony resonates. We acknowledge the maestro's talent, the flashes of brilliance, the echoes of what could have been. But the lingering taste is one of missed notes, of potential left unrealized. ""Rebel Moon"" is a spectacle, no doubt, but a hollow one, leaving us yearning for the sci-fi opera that might have been.~magadalwarmayur rated 5/10 on 17 December 2023"," Eye Candy-Empty Shell: The Zack Snyder fanboy cult is legion. That's fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.Objectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of its average, with a few exceptions. But there's always cool stuff to look at. The usual Snyder-verse effects are on full display: long establishing shots, fight scenes using slo-mo and speed shifting, and massive objects being viewed by terrified onlookers. He's kind of a poor man's Villaneuve.The rabid followers can say what they want about ""The Snyder Cut"" Justice League, but the reality is there's no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn't there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn't fun to spend money on. Especially when it's not all that new.I do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) ""thanks, but no thanks"".So he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.It's not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I'm over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it's all a bunch of BS. I don't care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren't in this, in case you're confused), it's stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we're all a little more savvy now and wouldn't buy that stuff from them in today's market either. But maybe I'm wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.The review of the performances? Boutella? Strictly two note delivery. Honsu? Not bad, dour and angry. Hunaam? Possibly the most nuanced.The plot? Star Wars excuse aside, it's a mess. The preposterousness of engaging with their Seven Samurai recruits at moments when each is faced with a crucial test is just lazy storytelling.The villains? One dimensional and very unconvincing. One, the most visible, a bizarre space nazi foil, is so predictable and poorly written that he could be dropped into any of a number of other films. The other? The supposedly all powerful Big Bad who apparently has the power of life over death is a comic book trope of a villain. Evil for evil's sake. And the dumb resurrection of the former by the latter begs the question: how do you threaten a subordinate that you just brought back to life? And instead of original visuals, Snyder dips deeply into the visually obscene as replacement for creativity. The very last image is of a rogue droid, having gone ""wild"" after killing one of its ""masters"", standing up in a field, wearing a crown of deer antlers. Now that would have been a story worth exploring.There are much better choices to spend two hours on. Watch Rogue One, which at its core, this movie wishes it was.It's free to subscribers now, so have at it. Can't wait to see those reviews pour in.~TMAuthor23 rated 5/10 on 18 December 2023"," How did this get made ?: This is probably one of the worst films made in the last 10 year ,but the biggest question is who decided this was a good idea, and who keeps giving Zack Snyder money to make this crap!The dialogue and the cinema photography looks like it came out of a PS4 cut scene. As for the action sequences, imagine if a fanboy, got a hold of a camcorder and shot a load of matrix style inspired scenes, after the 2nd sequence it becomes quite annoyed and nauseating.It Almost like they started filming, then decided to write a plot based on previous literature or films. Every actor in the film looks like they're reciting lines from hostage video.It's telling that they couldn't get a proper studio to finance this film and instead had to go straight to streaming as no one would pay decent money to see this.The fact they've already produced a sequel, only tells you how delusional they were when they put this thing into production.~danhaines-37800 rated 3/10 on 24 December 2023"

Wielding the Black Trident's power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom."," A mix of awesome and bad: So many aspects of this movie are a complete mixed bag:1) Half of the comedy is really funny, the other half made me roll my eyes.2) Some of the one-liners are good, some made me cringe.3) A lot of the action is so cool, a lot is a screen full of gibberish.4) There are so many beautiful shots and visuals, and also horribly cartoonish CGI like in The Flash.5) I enjoyed the musical score, but it doesn't reach the level of Black Adam's. And I wasn't a fan of using classic rock tracks for a lighter tone, something we're more likely to see in a Marvel movie.6) Half the time I was invested, the other half I was unengaged and didn't care.I had an okay time wit this movie. It benefits from IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio for the entire movie. But in the biggest IMAX around, there were a total of 8 people in my theater. DC seems to have alienated its die-hard fans.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 12/21/2023)~FeastMode rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie themed rides: Aquaman and The Lost of Kingdom suffers THE SAME problem with the first installment; it DOES NOT have a distinct identity. We were shocked to see that the major problem they had in Aquaman 1 was again manifested in this sequel. If you watch a film, you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you. But this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films, almost like a parody. There's a 10-minute scene where you felt like this is from an Indiana Jones world, and then the next thing you know, you're stuck in the realm of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. We can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie. War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, Ridley Scott's Aliens and... okay, we'll stop now. The result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies. It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie-themed rides (minus the 'fun').Adding to that, the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with Ridley Scott's Alien style of exposition. Alien was a masterpiece but like we said, this is a dumpster reiteration, it was slow, it had little to no suspense, it tried to build momentum but it didn't work. They could have cut 10 minutes but they didn't. It was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house film.Now, a lot are asking, is Amber Heard in it? Well, yes. Did she have many scenes? Her presence was only about 15% of the whole film. Her character, Mera did play a pivotal role for the story but James Wan, the director knew when to show her on screen. The question, 'Is her presence important on screen?' seems like what James Wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in. She only had few dialogues but her performance was still flat.We also have a problem with how much they made use of 'space'. Especially in the first act, we saw they're a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots; the surroundings, locations or/and environments were only there because... they were made to be there. It barely did anything to the story. But when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras, the cameras ddin't give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals. A lot of mid to fast cuts, there wasn't much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built. In the end, we felt discontented.First Aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch. This time, the villain or again, villains were just forgettable. The motivations were weak. The main villain didn't really drive the story forward. It had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movie's existence. We couldn't care less because it's nowhere interesting, let alone enjoyable.And talking about that final battle... oh man. It was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable. Was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here? The whole movie, led to the final battle, it was a journey between Aquaman and his brother, only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for Aquaman and his weapon. It's just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overall.And the movie draggggggsssssss so much, we even questioned, 'What happened to James Wan?' From the beginning up until the climax, we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen, but it didn't. It drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then that's when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up. We're confused.Amidst these flaws, one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood. A beautiful message combo with good pairing, Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson have commendable chemistry, we can see it from the way they talk to each other. There's certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship. It's nothing that you can remember for years but it's enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to be.Ultimately, Aquaman 2 seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone, rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrative.Verdict: Similar to its predecessor, this sequel fails to find its identity, drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies. With a shallow story, forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing, this film struggles to stay afloat. While it's a tidal wave of disappointing results, the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon, carrying the entire movie. Overall, this final chapter from the DCEU serves as a testament we're in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes.~iamianiman rated 3/10 on 20 December 2023"," Ends The DCEU On The Bummest Possible Note: The most accurate word I can think of to describe Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is annoying. Where the first film was hardly a masterpiece of the genre I thought it was over the top in all the right ways and because of that I actually mostly enjoyed it. This movie just doubles down on the insanity in all the worst ways and I ended up finding it borderline insufferable.For the first 15 minutes or so I thought I could enjoy it in a so bad it's good sort of way but it's too stupid to even enjoy in that way. The script just makes so many errors on the most basic level that if you think about any thing about this story for more than a minute it just collapses. Nothing that gets set up pays off in any meaningful way and most of the resolutions fell totally flat. It can't decide on a tone, it drags majorly and most of the humour made me cringe in all the worst ways.The performances really suffer as a result cause they're pretty poor across the board. I've liked Jason Momoa as this character but he's just too campy in this movie to take anything he's doing seriously, even actors of Yahya Abdul-Manteen II and Nicole Kidman's calibre deliver their lines in the flattest way possible but with the material they're given I can hardly blame that on them. I'm happy that Willem Dafoe was spared from this mess at least.The finale is the most bog standard CGI noise of a climax that we've seen so many times before that I was just totally bored watching it, at least the first film had some sense of spectacle to it. There's the odd fun action scene but the pretty dreadful visual effects just constantly took me out of it. The villain is terrible after a decent set up in the first film with the most generic motivations possible.The Lost Kingdom ends the DCEU with the biggest thud imaginable. It's been up and down since the beginning but it deserved a better conclusion than the soulless slog that this movie turned out to be. This might be the worst movie they ever made because at least Justice League had a happy conclusion with the Snyder Cut. There's nothing in this movie you haven't seen 100 times before and I've never been more ready for a total reboot of this universe.~cdjh-81125 rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Wow, this was COMPLETELY awful: This movie feels like the equivalent of Eminem's Revival cause my god, this movie is a dumpster fire in the worst way with poor writing, sloppy characters, and bad performances. The first Aquaman movie is absolutely ridiculous but I enjoyed it because it didn't take itself too seriously and understand what the movie was. I thought it had a fun energy and went bonkers in the best way. However, all the fun, energy and bonkers entertainment is just thrown out of the window with this sequel because this sequel is a gigantic mess.The narrative continues from the previous movie with new settings and concepts introduced and while I did like they introduced new settings that are pretty cool. Unfortunately, the writing feels really convoluted because the concepts and ideas were messy as if the writers didn't know how to put the concepts well-together. With all the reshoots and drama happening behind the scenes, I can't be surprised that the structure had fallen apart. Many of the special effects, production, make-up, and the colorful presentation are pretty rough and there are some noticeable poor CGI used but not like The Flash situation. The soundtrack is annoying and the action and thrills were just okay. Many of the cast members are doing their best but unfortunately, the performances weren't great and the dialogue was pretty bad. I honestly feel bad for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II cause he's talented and the character of Black Manta is pretty cool, but Mateen doesn't really get his chances to shine with his character.Director James Wan is talented as I enjoyed many of his works and I can see Wan is trying his best to create the sequel like the first one, but his direction was really bad as it feels sloppy and inconsistent. The sequel tries to follow the same non-serious 80s cheesy style, humor and tone from the previous movie but it doesn't work because the sequel kind of misses the point of what made the first one entertaining and ends up being pretty cringeworthy.I knew this movie wasn't going to be great and I just wanted to have dumb popcorn entertainment. Some dumb fun and laugh for the cheesiness but wow, it surprised me on how bad it was.One of the worst movies I have seen this year. Also from DC.~chenp-54708 rated 1/10 on 22 December 2023"," Entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before: IF this was made in the early days of superhero franchises, say when Iron Man first came out, then it might have stood out. Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.James Wan doesn't offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there's such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.Jason Momoa's charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he's reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn't help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.I find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You've seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.Don't have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don't have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman's talent is such that, even small screen time doesn't stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.Which leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - ""do I live in hate, or do I forgive?"" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.I hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it's also a by the numbers' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember.~jayenjr rated 6/10 on 22 December 2023"," Aquaman and the ""LOST SCRIPT"": Rating: 5/10Format: Regular TheatreA script that doesn't have any story to hold it tight together. It's a very interesting story that discusses many aspects like family, brotherhood, fatherhood, and leadership. But, perhaps this was its core problem, that it was trying to be so many things at the same time. At times i didn't know where the story was heading which made the story jump from discussing topics like fatherhood to an adventure with two brothers who had beef in their past. The film is unfortunately a typical superhero film in terms of expecting what's coming next from events, and sequences.On top of that and with all the chaos, the film re-discusses the villain's story which revolves around his revenge but it was so weak comparing to how it was in the first film. I didn't feel his presence nor i felt his evilness. He was suppose to be much stronger here but i barely felt him. The film also brings back old characters that just all of a sudden showed up in some sequences to save the day and be the superhero of the act which felt so weird because they came out of nowhere.The film's CGI is okay at most times. It's defiantly not as good as the first one but it is for sure better than most of the MCU's latest projects this year like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). The cinematography unfortunately got downgraded which is something that I was anticipated for especially after seeing the first part. But I felt like there was no room for that because of how messy the sequences and story was especially that we were jumping between the past and present a lot and from one place to another.Not to mention, the whole last sequence of the film was so good in terms of the action sequences and grabbing the audience's attention. Really got me hooked and interested and wished if the rest was like that.~Aziz24 rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," Ended before the story started: How can a movie resonate with the viewer, if the story builds for two hours, and ends in 10 seconds? How can a writer think that this will have an impact on the viewer?Well, the film feels and looks like a comic book. It is an simple comic book storyline, It feels kinda like a saturday morning cartoon. This is a great look if you're going for an animated movie, but for a whole picture that is demanding towards older audiences.. this is a problem. An problem which Hollywood doesn't seem to care about. Because I've seen this in almost every high-budget adventure film this year.It is always the same structure. The Hero returns and needs to save someone or defend somewhere, one that is near to him explains that he needs to get to A because at B him awaits an creature, that is much stronger than him. So he needs to get an item, or in this specific case, get an person, that could help him. AND very important to note here, is that the villain always gets teased at this part as this demonic, highly frightening creature.In the end, he's mostly just an huge piece of plastic or an huge piece of Green-Screen. Or, the worst case, he dies in merely 60 seconds after his great appearance.While this kind of storytelling overshadows what audiences REALLY want, and what potentially great writers could achieve if there would be more demand for interesting, immersive concepts and ideas in Hollywood, at least, please, try your best in writing your characters Appealing.The first Aquaman is simple, it's basic, but in it's first minutes it's already emotionally resonating and has GREAT camera-angles that psychologically just attracts someone to stay for more. The movement of the camera was immediately grabbing. And in the end, you got an work of art which is intense, epic and emotional at once, just because the filmmaking does the best out of it.So, either have a great script, or have a great filmmaker, a great sound-editor, cinematographer, composer, color-grader, visual effects artist..Filmmaking is not without reason called an art-form.~hanschsolo rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Nothing Stands Out: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom seem to have taken a dive, leaving us with a rather soggy DC EU experience. Jason Momoa's Aquaman fails to make a splash as a top-tier superhero, and the revenge tour promised by Black Manta turns out to be more of a leisurely swim. Forget showcasing Aquaman's raw power; we're stuck with a neglectful father, husband, and king who happens to be proficient at water aerobics. The movie spends more time on side attractions like cinematography, visuals, and subordinates, forgetting that Aquaman should be the main event. With attempts at humor falling flatter than a sunken ship, it's clear they lost the recipe that made the first Aquaman somewhat tolerable. And seriously, a DCEU finale without a Justice League cameo? It's like they're drowning in missed opportunities. I'll generously give it a two out of five-mainly for the underwater scenery.~Entertainmentsparadise rated 4/10 on 23 December 2023"," Battle of the Tridents: I was a bit confused about Atlantis being somehow still hidden. I just thought everybody knew about with Aquaman fighting for the Justice League, which BTW is nearly non-existent in this feature except for a Ben Affleck cameo. Let's just pretend DC Comics decided to have its own ""reset.""With the help of a scientist (Randall Park) and global warming David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) discovers the existence of another Atlantis, or at least the broken black trident of the Lost Kingdom of Necros. Holding the two pieces together Kane is given knowledge to uncover the lost technology that Atlantis had abandoned because it was destroying their world by altering the climate. (See where this is going.) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) must resque his brother (Patrick Wilson) from the Harry Potter prison of Azkaban. They then must see a pirate who looks like Jabba the Hut. The nobody hits my brother line reminded me of Beverly Hill Ninja. I am not sure why they played ""Spirit in the Sky"" for underwater scenes as if I wasn't confused enough. Aquaman does have a son in his feature who can talk to fishes. I was disappointed it never came into play.Good action. Horrible script. Waste of money.~nogodnomasters rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023"," Anyone with a functioning brain, better pass this one by!: Only suited for energy drink addicted teenagers, who want to their movies to be like a nonstop action game.The bad: this movie is too violent for young kids and way too stupid for any grownup adult.

Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!: Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," Poor Things Emma Stone's Mesmerizing Resurrection: ""Poor Things"" is a spellbinding tale that catapults the audience into the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist, Dr. Godwin Baxter.

This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.~Lepidopterous_ rated 9/10 on 8 December 2023"," A Film not a movie, powerful, discomforting, unique, splendidly difficult and high craft throughout: This is not a film for the faint of heart nor the prudish. A bold film recalling us with consuming set designs, subtle changes in bold costuming across scenes, a cinematic score, surrealistic elements in London, magical realism in Lisbon, philophical noir on a ship and harsh yet poetic reality in Paris. Emma Stone is brilliant throwing herself into this role with studied abandon. Defoe and Ruffalo are strong.This is at root a film about femine spirit freed of societies embedding of politeness, being proper and pretty. How might it be if we shook the tree by getting out of woman's way? Caring or cruel?If you love film, this is must view art. If a movie goer seeking traditional plot lines, clean character arcs and familiar tropes; wait until you can stream this at home. Thus you can turn it off 30 minutes in and review the film here. Enjoy.~jtscheduling rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Poor Things is defiantly original, both visually striking and though provoking in equal measure - a true cinematic masterpiece: ""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!~laurenspierre rated 10/10 on 19 October 2023", Unforgivingly Bizarre and chaotic but endearing: The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates.~Camerenth rated 9/10 on 15 December 2023," A Bizarre Masterpiece: If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.~aciessi rated 9/10 on 24 December 2023"," Lanthimos at his most charming: Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.~drownsoda90 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling: I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time.

Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew.

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.~kevin_robbins rated 5/10 on 20 November 2023"," Long, Boring and not needed.: No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.~skylermoore rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023"," Not On Par: In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.~Tweetienator rated 4/10 on 21 November 2023"," Welcome to the 10th Annual Boring Games... I mean Hunger Games: I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.~nscoby93 rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Incredibly faithful to the book: Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.~vitordrios rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Prequel that tries to show some of the history of the fictional world, but remains somewhat unnecessary.: The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 4/10 on 19 November 2023"," A sure misfire!: I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.~gabriel-80 rated 5/10 on 15 November 2023"," This certainly does not catch fire.: It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Disappointment: I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.~ArchilArjevanidze rated 3/10 on 17 November 2023"," Pleasantly Surprised: I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews.

Utterly fantastic!: GODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023) **** Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Sakura Ando, Yuki Yamada, Kuranosuke Sasake, Hidetaka Yaoshioka, Yuya Endo, Saki Nakatani. Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic). One of the year's best films.~george.schmidt rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"," The best movie I've seen in the theater this year: I would not call myself a huge Godzilla fan by any means and I mainly went to see this one at the urging of a friend. Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending.~MissSimonetta rated 9/10 on 3 December 2023"," Maybe the best Godzilla movie since the original: I'm a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great ""monster"" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)4) Shin Godzilla (2016)5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)~druss44121-1 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," OUTSTANDING: This is an exciting film. The pace, story, imagination, production are all done expertly. Dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles. I wish I could comment on writing but just be assured that despite my remedial Japanese (and a range of inconsequential translation departures the I detected), the cast's ability to convey agony, loss, hope, love, fear, and anger was appreciated, even with its 'just-right' dose of melodrama. Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity. It makes you fall in love with the characters.Then with perfect timing, reflects the singular and exquisite quality of the Japanese people; their acute sense of the cost of war and their abiding commitment to the future.Because of that, there is nothing in this film that I can criticize.~rhmacl rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," This is what a Godzilla is supposed to be: From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie. It kept everything that I loved about Godzilla, and was able to make an extremely interesting backstory with the human characters. There was a lot of things that was addressed in this movie that I had never seen before.there was so many things that people will pick apart, but that's upon reflection. I had no criticisms or a reason to dislike this movie the whole time I watched it. So, in that respect, I will give it a perfect score. And I don't go slinging those out just every review. As a Godzilla fan, this was perfection to me.~dormantgene rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," A Masterpiece Retelling of a Classic: Godzilla Minus One is an amazing spectacle on a retelling of a classic Kaiju movie from the prospective of a post-war Japanese veteran who leaves one horror for the next while making an arrangement of ""friends and family"" along the way. The story was so compelling that it didn't feel like two hours past and I was craving for more. The classic Godzilla sounds design, masterful cinematography, along with the original score from Akira Ifukube made this movie an absolute masterpiece on storytelling! The visuals of the Godzilla update made him more memorable and menacing for the citizens of a distraught Tokyo. Highly recommended!~Squirrel_the_Grip_1 rated 9/10 on 1 December 2023", One of the Best Godzilla movies in recent times: Godzilla Minus One is one of the best Godzilla films in recent time. It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.~tyzilla-02450 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023," This is one of the best iterations of Godzilla I have ever seen, and I have seen them all: I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.~sheridan-turner rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," Very good surprise: Finally a Godzilla movie with interesting and developed characters, for this point it's certainly the best of the franchise.(Spoiler part) I also thought the death of one particular character was really surprising... Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title ""Minus One"" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's ""Subarashiki nichiyobi"" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.~koroxx rated 9/10 on 3 November 2023"," Go See This Movie: After the brain cell killing abomination known as Godzilla vs. Kong, the monsterverse was ruined for me. I also found the movie Shin Godzilla to be kind of boring. I have yet to watch that movie and not fall asleep through it. So when I seen Godzilla Minus One, it blew me away. It is easily one of the best Godzilla movies out there. At least in the top 5. I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget. I am in no way interested in seeing Godzilla x Kong 2, but I would gladly see what Toho has in store for THEIR upcoming monster movie projects.~bak-67163 rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"

And why you dont have to believe the haters...: What do the haters complain about? And why you should still watch this final edition.1 The first Indiana Jones editions were the best.This new edition has got the same spirit, the same amount of action, the same amount of adventure and I loved it (almost) as much as the early editions.2 The leading actress Phoebe is a disaster.My personal opinion is that she aint bad at all. She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana's old age in all of it's demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It's too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the ""in your face"" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT. Even an adventure needs some serious notes, to be more credible. And by the way, I am not a kid anymore and so arent many other Indiana fans!5 Steven Spielberg didnt direct it.But James Mangold did and whoever googles Mangold's Imdb carreer, soon will find out this director has made some fabulous movies. I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps. I had a wonderful time watching this last edition!Just another solidly made Indiana Jones flick. Enjoy the show!Thank you for reading my 2000 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 7/10 on 3 July 2023"," Was actually depressing instead of fun: ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that ""Dial of Destiny"" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.~thejefflewis-92228 rated 6/10 on 1 July 2023"," Had it's moments, but did this really need to be made.: I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end.~DarkVulcan29 rated 6/10 on 30 June 2023"," A Muddled Misadventure: It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 6/10 on 17 July 2023"," Not The Final Indiana Jones Movie I Wanted: I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment.~slightlymad22 rated 6/10 on 28 June 2023"," Lacks The Spielbergian Magic Of Its Predecessors: The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering.~CinemaClown rated NA on 3 July 2023"," Indy's farewell fares well: Greetings again from the darkness. ""They look like snakes."" It's such a simple line of dialogue, yet after 42 years and four previous movies, we know exactly what that means to retiring archaeology professor, Dr. Henry Jones, best known to all as the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. As the final chapter of the beloved franchise, this entry is the first one not directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg (listed here as an Executive Producer). Instead, James Mangold takes the reins, and also shares writing credit with his frequent collaborators Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth, as well as ""Indiana Jones"" veteran David Koepp. Of course, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman receive credit for their original characters.Harrison Ford once again dons the familiar whip and hat, and at 80 years of age, still possesses the screen persona and magnetism that first won us over in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The extended and frenetic opening sequence finds a young Indy (Ford is digitally de-aged for the sequence) at the tail end of WWII fighting Nazis over what else, a prized ancient artifact. I'll leave the specifics to those who watch the film, but just know that it's an interesting historical choice, and also one that matters little in relation to the enjoyment of the film.Working alongside Indy in the opening sequence is his pal and fellow archaeologist, Basil Shaw (talented character actor Toby Jones, who seems to be in most movies these days). However, the fun part for me is seeing Thomas Kretschmann and Mads Mikkelsen share scenes as Nazi Colonel Weber and Dr. Voller, respectively. These are two of my favorite actors and I do wish they had a couple more exchanges ... although Mikkelsen's character gets significant screen time and plays a crucial role in how the story unfolds and concludes (he is also digitally de-aged for the opening sequence).The story picks up with modern day Dr Voller and his band of misfits tracking down the relic and disturbing Dr. Jones' retirement party. It's at this point where Indy's Goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pops up creating a three-way battle for the priceless relic. This sets off a chain of events that leads them on a global trek to desert, sea, and hallowed cities of antiquity. Helena's partner in crime is young Teddy (Ethann Isidore, sporting a Bob Griese Dolphins jersey), who is clearly the scrappiest of the bunch. Dr Voller's troupe includes Shaunetta Renee Wilson as the misguided Mason, Brad Holbrook as sleazy Klaber, and Olivier Richters as one of the largest bodyguards you've ever seen.Fans of the franchise know that the story is secondary to the characters and action, and there is no shortage of action on speeding trains, galloping horses, motorcycles, tuk tuks, vintage airplanes, and scuba dives. Antonio Banderas shows up as a boat-owning old friend of Indy, but it's the appearance of series favorites John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and Karen Allen as Marion, that generated cheers from the audience. Ms. Waller-Bridge holds her own with screen legend Ford, and it will be interesting to see the career path she chooses after her success on TV and now film. At times this feels like a live action cartoon, and that's not meant as criticism. It's pure fun, fantasy, and adventure cloaked in nostalgia; and the film is a fitting conclusion to a world class franchise.Opens in theaters June 30, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 29 June 2023"," A legend will face his destiny: I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too.~Cinema-reviewer321 rated 6/10 on 7 July 2023"," I'll never understand the hate.: I understand some of the criticisms I've heard surrounding this final Jones outing; it's burdened by a handful of excessively bizarre ideas and an overabundance of characters.But one criticism I'll never understand is that this is somehow disrespectful toward the Indiana Jones character-that it belittles him or mocks him in some way. I could not agree less with this.What I saw today was a film made by a director who understands, respects, and loves this character. He crafted a hearty adventure story that adds depth to Jones and sends him off fondly.Indiana and Helena are characters that are both shown to be capable, intelligent, and protective and they both save each other quite often. They are introduced as closed-off but they wear each others' emotional layers down over the course of the story in subtle, natural ways that really did affect me and make me feel something.The film is shot and directed immaculately-the action is brisk yet hard and thrilling. Sure, the story's ambition requires a LOT of CGI, and it's more noticeable than it should be at times.But that didn't stop me from loving the film because the script is smart, constantly shifting power dynamics and developing character to keep you invested in the world.This is leagues better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I really hope people avoid the hate train that's been building online and give this last adventure a chance in theaters.~benjaminskylerhill rated 8/10 on 30 June 2023"," I liked everything but Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Very Minor Spoilers): The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie.~themarvelheroeslildoop rated 6/10 on 3 July 2023"

Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.~prberg2 rated 5/10 on 30 September 2023"," The Creator uses its budget masterfully, but it's not without its problems: This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.~poseyfan rated 7/10 on 29 September 2023"," What's it all about, Alphie?: The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.~BA_Harrison rated 5/10 on 27 September 2023"," Lots of stuff happend then it ended: I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly.~Jim_Screechy rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Technically Watchable but Emotionally Vacant.: Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.~kgprophet rated 5/10 on 29 September 2023"," Typical and formulaic: Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)~FeastMode rated 4/10 on 28 September 2023", Stunning visuals/Garbage Script: With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.~davemanson rated 4/10 on 11 October 2023," The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element: My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 September 2023"," State of the art effects, but more holes than Swiss cheese: Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.~Lomax343 rated 6/10 on 28 September 2023"," By the numbers take on man vs robots dystopia: AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.~alex_with_a_P rated 4/10 on 1 October 2023"

They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly.~Jim_Screechy rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Technically Watchable but Emotionally Vacant.: Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.~kgprophet rated 5/10 on 29 September 2023"," Typical and formulaic: Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)~FeastMode rated 4/10 on 28 September 2023", Stunning visuals/Garbage Script: With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.~davemanson rated 4/10 on 11 October 2023," The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element: My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 September 2023"," State of the art effects, but more holes than Swiss cheese: Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.~Lomax343 rated 6/10 on 28 September 2023"," By the numbers take on man vs robots dystopia: AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.~alex_with_a_P rated 4/10 on 1 October 2023"

When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero."," One Step Above Masterpiece!: It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.~MiroslavKyuranov rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," Masterful IMAX Spider-Man: The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," One of the best sequels to anything ever made: If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.~pugpool10 rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," A new Empire Strikes Back: This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.~rickothan rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," Okay This Is Peak: First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.~hectorvernet rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.~cricketbat rated 7/10 on 1 June 2023"," It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5): Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.~nickryan-44535 rated 7/10 on 6 June 2023"," My movie of 2023 so far.: It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 11 June 2023"," This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.: I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.~DeadMansTrousers rated 6/10 on 14 June 2023"," Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it: I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 11 June 2023"

I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.~The_DATo rated 10/10 on 24 May 2022"," Silent Thrills: The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.~billygoat1071 rated 8/10 on 25 March 2012"," I'm shocked! I loved it!: First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.8/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 8/10 on 22 April 2012"," Well, it's no Battle Royale...: There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.~wandereramor rated 6/10 on 23 May 2012"," Not quite the Battle Royale: Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.~hani_78696 rated 7/10 on 8 October 2012"," How can this be a cult movie?: OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...~aryassen rated 3/10 on 23 March 2012"," Modern Classic: ""The Hunger Games"" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like ""Bullett"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""Westworld"" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe ""The Hunger Games"" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig's mouth), ""The Running Man"" (More on this later), ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), ""The Lottery"" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in ""The Hunger Games"", since with the exception of the overall winner, ""Winning"" the lottery is a negative,""Total Drama Island"" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, ""Survivor"", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens ""I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks ""History of The World Part I"")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: "" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The ""Karate Kid"" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of ""The Hunger Games"" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when ""Judges"" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: ""My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you."" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):"" There are lots of underdogs in this world,"" he snaps, ""if you could really see them, you would not root for them either."" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""The Running Man."" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the ""Love Sign"", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars.~davidjanuzbrown rated 10/10 on 20 August 2012"," Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!: Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In ""The Hunger Games"", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of ""The Hunger Games"" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next ""Twilight"" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least ""Battle Royale"" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in ""The Hunger Games"" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see ""The Hunger Games"". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, ""The Hunger Games"" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10~GirishGowda rated 3/10 on 26 March 2012"," Spoilers! But don't worry, it's already predictable and weak.: The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. ""Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!"" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll.~groovieknave-177-74234 rated 1/10 on 27 March 2012"," Battle Royale with cheese: In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.~jackharding89-1 rated 3/10 on 9 April 2012"

Yet his films are not just aesthetically engaging; they tend to be hilarious and well-written in a quirky, down-to-earth way. As a fan of his work, I was looking forward to ""Asteroid City."" This retro sci-fi tale of a UFO/alien sighting in a 1950s desert town certainly delivers Anderson's expected vibes, but fails to pair the visuals and auteurist elements with an engaging, emotionally impactful plot or character development that is equally strong and/or effective.The film is a true ensemble piece, and doesn't have a clear main character. This would be fine if the wide array of characters involved were more compellingly written, but the screenplay treats their motivations as simply second fiddle to ""style,"" world-building, and more abstract themes. Thematically, the film also seems a bit inert, seeming to jump around in subtext without providing the plot context to justify it--including through the framing device of a play. Anderson's large ensemble cast generally does pretty well with the material they are given, but their actions feel removed from consequence or plot relevance to make us feel a lot fo their characters. The brilliant craftsmanship on display mildly offsets these concerns--from the outstanding production design, cinematography, costume design, and editing--which are well-done even by Wes Anderson's standards. Yet the lack of a comparatively developed plot or character motivations is a bit jarring compared to his better films, such as ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" ""The Royal Tenebaums,"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Even the anthology structure in ""The French Dispatch"" felt more character-driven and authentic, and thus more conceptually engaging than this film. Make no mistake, Anderson is and has always been a creative visionary, and his fans should generally have a good time while watching this film. It's just a little bit unfortunate that the film comes off as more hollow and forgettable than it should, despite plenty of positive qualities as well. Recommended only to Wes Anderson fans. 6.5/10.~bastille-852-731547 rated 6/10 on 13 June 2023"," Packed to the Rafters with Nothing of Note: It is hard to think of a movie as underwhelming or as twee as Wes Anderson's 'Asteroid City,' a meandering, grandiose comic-drama as overlong as it is overindulgent. As it begins, we are told the film is in fact a televised production of a play by a fellow named Conrad Earp, which follows a ragtag bunch of misfits who gather on the isolated titular town to partake in a science convention. Among them is recent widower and war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck, who hits it off with noted actress Midge Campbell. Meanwhile, the actor playing Augie has doubts about his performance, and fears he doesn't understand the play.A fear shared by this viewer. 'Asteroid City' is a film packed to the rafters with nothing of note. The narrative is overloaded with unnecessary stylizations that distract rather than engage. Moreover, the switching back and forth between the play and the show about it is jarring throughout, while the overarching structure is alienating. It is difficult to immerse oneself in the world of the film as one is constantly reminded it is fiction. Similarly, it is no easy task connecting with the characters when the film they're in keeps telling us that they and their conflicts are imaginary.Additionally, Anderson doesn't fully explore any of the innumerable story threads he begins to unravel, nor does he properly develop his themes, whether they be about reality and fiction, the role of science and technology or the search for identity and belonging. He introduces thematic ideas in a superficial and inconsistent way, without giving them enough depth or resolution. This makes the film feel unfocused and incomplete, as it leaves the viewer with many questions and loose ends.For instance, he introduces the idea of a nuclear war looming over Asteroid City, but doesn't explore its implications or consequences for the characters or the world. He also introduces the character of Conrad Earp, the playwright behind it all, but never explains his motivations or his relationship with the actors or the audience. Moreover, he fails to conclude any of the various subplots in a meaningful or coherent way, seeming to prefer endlessly switching between different levels of artifice in a vacuum of self-satisfaction.Furthermore, the characters are all Anderson stereotypes dialled up to the max. We've seen the quirky neurotic Steenbeck before in projects like 'Rushmore' and 'Darjeeling Limited', while Campbell is essentially just Margot Tenenbaum with better hair, or any number of the beautiful, aloof ladies Anderson has given the world over the years. Each and all eccentric and mannered, the people that populate 'Asteroid City' feel like they were created by artificial intelligence trying to emulate Anderson's earlier, better movies.Likewise, the dialogue is your typical Anderson fare, full of cutesy phrases and obscure references that'll make grey-haired hipsters chuckle; though is a different breed from the likes of, say, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.' For all its faults, that film had plenty of rapid-pace witticisms and verbal sparring matches, which 'Asteroid City' has a dearth of. The dialogue is largely uninspired and inane, when it isn't contrived and artificial, as it is whenever Steenbeck's son has to converse with anyone, or when Steenbeck and Campbell share their woes through their windows.Narratively, 'Asteroid City' isolates and irritates, while Robert Yeoman's striking cinematography is cartoonish and extravagant. Yeoman makes use of bright colours, symmetrical compositions and retro-futuristic props and costumes to create a distinctive, whimsical aesthetic that reflects Anderson's trademark visual style. The attention to detail on display is laudable, while the intricacy of the sets and staging is staggering. However, Yeoman's work also contributes to the tacky artificiality and lack of subtlety of proceedings, meaning that, instead of enhancing the mood or meaning of the film, his exaggerated stylizations serve only to distract. Additionally, the score-a jumbled mixture of 50's country songs and synthetic pop- is as forgettable and bland as saltless porridge.Though Anderson has assembled a truly awesome all-star cast, nobody is giving anything particularly interesting or challenging to do. Though Jason Schwartzman does strong work as the quirky, self-absorbed neurotic Augie Steenbeck, it's a role he's played dozens of times before in better projects and to greater effect. Similarly, Scarlett Johansson impresses as the austere Midge Campbell, showing her vulnerability in a way most nuanced and affecting; though is underutilised and ultimately reduced to a mere plot device.Additionally, Bryan Cranston does a half-decent Rod Serling impression as the narrator of the piece and Tom Hanks brings pathos and power to his all too small role as Steenbeck's father-in-law, though both characters are woefully one-dimensional. Also worthy of note is Jeffrey Wright, who's consistently amusing as a caricature of an army general, and Tilda Swinton, who engages in more of the jittery over-acting that has endeared her to so many. The rest of the cavalcade of stars are generally commendable, but have little to do in the face of Anderson's scant characterisation and unengaging narrative.In conclusion, 'Asteroid City,' like 'The French Dispatch' before it, is very much a case of style over substance. Anderson's best films- perhaps tellingly all written alongside Owen Wilson- have heart and soul to match their kooky characters and painstakingly intricate visuals. 'Asteroid City' is a heartless, soulless exercise in pretension; a meandering mess of a motion picture. Though it boasts some fine performances, there's very little on offer in 'Asteroid City;' and it's certainly not a place you'd want to call home.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 4/10 on 16 August 2023"," He has out-Wes-Anderson himself: Wes Anderson has always been a favorite director of mine. I have seen all his movies - but for me, the magic is gone.I feel like The Grand Budapest Hotel was his masterpiece. Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while. One of us really liked it though - but she had only seen 50% of a Wes Anderson film before. The rest of us felt... full.~mennivetvadjagmenar rated 5/10 on 12 June 2023", What's the point of this movie?: This film was a huge let down. It was absolutely boring. Nothing happens in the entire film aside from a UFO/ Alien sighting which was shown in the trailers.This film is categorized as a drama/comedy/ romance and it doesn't succeed in any of them. The drama is so minimal that it's easy to overlook. This film tries to be comedic but it is so dry. I can't recall a single moment where I laughed. The slight romance it has is elementary.This film had no life to it. There wasn't anything in it that made me look forward to the next scene. It tries to be creative with a dual storyline. One storyline is that of a play in which the audience is watching as a film. The other storyline is supposed to be the behind the scenes activities of the actors who are acting in the play. It is a bit confusing at first but more than anything it unnecessarily complicates the story. The continues back and forth between the storylines does not add anything to the film. The way the scenes were split into acts was rather distracting instead of adding to the experience.There are so many well known actors in this film and not one single actor is used in a way that delivers a worthy performance. There were just too many characters for no reason. None of the characters were developed. There were a few lines stating who each character was and only two or three had something minimally happen throughout the film.The Wes Anderson's style was somewhat present but not as much as in his other films. It does have a nice use of colors but even that could not help how much this movie lacked any context.What was the point of this film?~moviemanmo rated 1/10 on 23 June 2023," Unfunny and incomprehensible: When you talk about big movie stars like Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson or Bryan Cranston... people often say, ""I'll watch them in anything."" Well, Asteroid City puts that notion to the test.This is a movie that's weird even by Wes Anderson's standards. It actually feels more like a parody of a Wes Anderson movie. And not in a good way.I would describe it like this: It's a movie of a TV broadcast of a play about a play... and what we see is the movie version of the play within the play within the TV show (I think I have all of that right... it's all very confusing). What's missing in all of this is any real plot or characters to care about. It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I like Anderson's films, but I just didn't get this one.~jmoney-2 rated 1/10 on 1 July 2023"," Worst of his movies, such a waste for this amazing cast: This is by far the worst of his movies. Such an incredible cast and he did nothing with them, the acting is good but the lack of an interesting story is unbelievable. It's a pretty film, yes, but even visually, it's the least interesting from his work. French dispatch was his first strike, Asteroid city is his second, really hope there's not a third. Hope he hires a good writer or writers to help him with his next films. We know he can do art direction, photography, and a few funny bits, but he needs someone to help him with plots. Really, with such an amazing cast, to come up with this, is so so so sad. What a waste. Truly disappointed.~fangel-31778 rated 4/10 on 18 June 2023"," Unmitigated bore of a film: This was a total disappointment from the start. The entire conceit, that it is a film within a play within a film is completely without interest. It seems to be a formal exercise in how far one can push a metaphor to the point where it has lost any meaning.I found myself falling asleep to it at one point when all the characters, each one looking into the lens, emote their lines without any emotional commitment whatsoever. The only one who seems to have any desire to project an iota of emotion, Scarlett Johansson, does her best to keep her audience interested, but even her attempt falls flat.There are numerous A-list cameos that have no reason to exist except to lend credence to the Auteur that Mr. Anderson has become. His obsession with proclaiming his own superiority leaves most of the cast cold, and even the best efforts by Tom Hanks and Adrien Brody cannot redeem what little story there is.The actors simply phone in their performances, particularly Jason Schwartzman, oddly enough, portraying a widower who does not grieve in front of his mismatched children, none of whom seems to notice their missing mother. Kudoes go to the three little girls who portray his daughters (blonde and blue eyed?) but who handle their roles like pros.Not much can be said for the rest of the cast, all of whom show up and portray their cardboard characters as best as they can, and the entire thing is missing any kind of heart -- it lasts way too long and by the time we have reached the anti-climax, we feel cheated out of any kind of feeling whatsoever.~naq-1 rated 2/10 on 16 June 2023"," This cast doesn't deserve this script: Wes Anderson drummed up a magnificent cast. At least ten of them could carry a triple A movie by themselves. Unfortunately, Wes forgot that a good movie needs a good plot as well.The visuals are outstanding, almost every shot is also an award winning photo. The acting is superb. The setting is magnificent and almost everything about this movie is perfect.Everything but the plot. If you like humor, you'll like this film. If you come for the visuals, you'll love this film. If you're into acting, you'll have an excellent time. But if you want to be engaged? Look elsewhere.Dear Wes, your dialogues are hilarious and witty. Your plots lack substance. Work on your plots.~spavaai rated 7/10 on 16 June 2023"," Style Over Substance: Near enough the definition of style over substance. At times seemed deliberately boring. Too much effort was spent in an attempt to seem clever, and not enough effort spent trying to be enjoyable.Occasional lines were enough to raise a slight chuckle, or an exhale of air, but they are much too few and far between in the vast stretches of emptiness.The impressive cast assembled don't do an awful job with what they've been given, but none of the characters have any depth whatsoever. Even if they were, there are far too many characters to form any kind of cohesion.It's quirky at best and painfully dull.~andyman789 rated 3/10 on 24 June 2023"," There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste,: I saw 'ASTEROID CITY' yesterday...and I have amixed feelings about it....As usual, stylistically very impressive, with strong emphasis on ensemble work of actors, as it's usually happens in Wes Anderson's movies.When movie is considered ensemble piece the pressure of a film success falls on the shoulders of the director. In a normal narrative film the protagonist and antagonist often take the burden of film success on themselves, hoping that the audience will emphasize with our lead characters and their character arc, to be immersed in the story during the full running time.There is a risk however if the audience doesn't connect with performances the status of leading man or a woman is in jeopardy, with producers in the future not wanting to green light another film with actors, which were unable to handle the ""weight"" of the movie.This is why plenty of actors like to work on movies which offer ensemble feel. They don't have to spend many months on filmset, instead they come for few days, shoot their scenes and can move on to the next project. If their performance didn't work they are always supported by other quality actors, so it doesn't ruin the whole film. In ether way Wes Anderson's style always comes on top, as actors who work with him understand the particular speed of lines delivery, as well as dryness of the dialog.Stylistically it's very much what we expect from Anderson. Cinematography is more interesting then usual with a strong emphasis on production and costumes design. The camera movement feel bit more free then usual and yet the composition is always full of symmetry, which is the calling card of Wes. He even included few inserts (close ups of objects, which normally make thinks appear more cinematic) which for his filmmaking style is rather unusual. As well as few ""Dutch angles"", which make the audience feel sense of distorted reality in moments of surrealism.The color correction ranging from black and white to colorful over saturation is rather visually interesting.There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste, although fans of Anderson know what to expect and should have a good time.More casual viewers might feel like this film is a little stylistically disjointed.For me I appreciate what Wes was trying to accomplish and always admire his stylistic consistency, which has its benefits (you know what to expect), but also it's throwbacks, when Wes just like in this case is trying to explore a new filmmaking narrative techniques.Recommend! 👍~j-madej rated 7/10 on 17 June 2023"
Dune (2021) - IMDb,8.0,Timothée Chalamet|Rebecca Ferguson|Zendaya|Oscar Isaac|Jason Momoa|Stellan Skarsgård|Stephen McKinley Henderson|Josh Brolin|Javier Bardem|Sharon Duncan-Brewster|Chang Chen|Dave Bautista|David Dastmalchian|Charlotte Rampling|Babs Olusanmokun|Benjamin Clémentine|Souad Faress|Golda Rosheuvel,Denis Villeneuve,Jon Spaihts|Denis Villeneuve|Eric Roth,A noble family becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxy's most valuable asset while its heir becomes troubled by visions of a dark future.," DUNE - A Great Modern Sci-Fi: Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I've seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It's epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.~FabledGentleman rated 9/10 on 13 September 2021"," My movie of 2021, so far.: It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 October 2021"," ""He shall know your ways as though born to them."": It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.~classicsoncall rated 9/10 on 22 October 2021"," Amazing cinematic experience: Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!~851222 rated 9/10 on 17 September 2021"," The Beginning: Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.~Hitchcoc rated 8/10 on 22 October 2021"," Villeneuve epic: Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.~SnoopyStyle rated 8/10 on 21 October 2021"," Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.: Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 26 October 2021"," I did not read the book and I did not know what to expect exactly. I LOVED it.: I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.In that sense, this movie had enough of an ending for me to not feel dissatisfied.That said, I will probably go and read the book instead of waiting 3 years (or forever) for the conclusion of this story arc.This is a movie of gigantic scale that feels so familiar, yet so fresh and and unique in it's own way. It's a 2.5 hour, polished piece of art and spectacle.I cannot recommend it more, and if you're hesitant because it's just part 1, don't be.I would give this an easy 9.5/10.~aarongnr rated 10/10 on 15 September 2021"," A Darker Dune: Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.~Pairic rated 9/10 on 19 October 2021"," Disappointing: I was looking forward to seeing this remake of the 1984 edition of Dune. I have read all the books and seen all the various follow ons as well. I must admit I was most disappointed. To someone watching the film with no knowledge of the books I think it would have been most confusing. My main complaint was the actors' diction. They all seemed to mumble and unfortunately the edition I watched had no subtitles. Parts of the book were left out and the whole film did not run smoothly. It is a huge book and I understand the need to split it into two parts, but surely if they are doing this they could at least keep in some of the more important parts. The special effects were good as were the costumes. The acting was OK but to be honest I preferred David Lynch's version from 1984,~celtigra rated 5/10 on 7 June 2023"

Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break.

Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break.

Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).Grade: A.~evanston_dad rated 9/10 on 24 May 2022"," best film of 2022: Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.~movieman_kev rated 9/10 on 2 May 2022"," Don't do drugs, watch this instead.: If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.~AfricanBro rated 9/10 on 8 April 2022"," Fantastic: ""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.~gbill-74877 rated 10/10 on 20 April 2022"," The most original film ever made. Period.: Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.~benjaminskylerhill rated 10/10 on 31 March 2022"," The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!: Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!~iamianiman rated 9/10 on 25 March 2022"," What a perfect title for this movie.: It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.~subxerogravity rated 9/10 on 26 March 2022"," It Seemed Endless: There's a point here where we are swept up in sensory overload, where so much stuff is thrown at us that we tune it out. I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen. But I ended up exhausted and unsatisfied.~Hitchcoc rated 6/10 on 3 April 2023"," What was that?!?: I don't mind weird films. Truly, I don't. But films that are pointlessly bizarre? Yeah, I'm not a fan of those. This is one such movie. I'd give it a pass if I were you.~maclock rated NA on 25 June 2022"," Near Flawless Film: Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.~statuskuo rated 9/10 on 1 April 2022"

You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...~kosmasp rated 10/10 on 31 May 2015"," A visual and auditory marvel: Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.~Jared_Andrews rated 10/10 on 13 April 2016", Masterpiece: A science-fiction masterpiece.

But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...~theoledoux rated 10/10 on 6 April 2021"," Masterpiece: Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing.~e-jackson1985 rated 10/10 on 8 May 2022"," 7 years later: Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant.~ravesch-83770 rated 10/10 on 29 October 2021"," A journey across the galaxy to save humanity: Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.~Tweekums rated 9/10 on 27 January 2016"," Excellent Movie: I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!~frank-ancestor-hunter rated 10/10 on 6 April 2015"," Absolutely Brilliant: A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics.~gavin6942 rated 9/10 on 25 January 2015"

That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.~poseyfan rated 9/10 on 10 May 2023"," A Fitting and Heartfelt End to the Trilogy: Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.~ta-98251 rated 8/10 on 4 May 2023"," One of the Best MCU Trilogies: Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: DraxBest Quote: ""She is to us.""Best Scene: Infiltrating OrgocorpBest Piece of Score: ""I Love You Guys""~jace_the_film_guy rated 9/10 on 8 May 2023"," This is one of the best MCU movies, hands down: ""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.~gcsman rated 9/10 on 7 May 2023"," I am groot: Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.~AfricanBro rated 8/10 on 3 May 2023"," A Beautifully Dark and Goofy Goodbye: This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.~breneff rated 9/10 on 3 May 2023"," Best Marvel film this year: It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.~josephbannister rated 10/10 on 4 May 2023"," A perfect send off for the Guardians: A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.~georgewhittingham1 rated 9/10 on 3 May 2023"," I Cried Four Times: I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.~coasteraddict-16796 rated 10/10 on 10 May 2023"," Emotional and energetic!: This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!~cthirlby rated 10/10 on 3 May 2023"

It expands the world with more backstory and characters, and the effects were better so it was more convincing and we felt like we were part of this world.

Toby Jones, still doesn't work for me here.Best of the lot for me.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 15 November 2023"," How to Do a Sequel Right: There are two types of sequels. On one side you have The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The The Dark Knight (2008), and on the other you have Jaws II (1978) and Terminator Genysis (2015). Thankfully, Catching Fire falls squarely in the first category. After an exciting, if not entirely fleshed out, first film, Catching Fire delivers on all the promises of intense action, compelling and intriguing story-line and dynamic relationships between the characters that we were all waiting for. The Hunger Games is a series which, conceptually, deserves a well put-together film series. It is a fun and interesting concept which matures with the audience from a usual action-filled romp into a political thriller which can inspire almost anyone. We got what we needed thanks to this wonderful sequel.In the first film, one of the key issues was the pacing. Many things felled rushed, especially the backstory for the characters which was more or less only seen in brief flashbacks and allusions. The lead up to The Games felt like a formality that they needed to get through so they could show us the action. This is understandable. Everyone wants to see people fighting, not sappy emotional moments from characters we don't even know yet. In Catching Fire, we get a much more fluid arc which gives us the perfect amount of set-up before dropping us into the second installment of The Games, which now have considerably more meaning than just staying alive. In some ways, it is allowed to because now we are familiar with the premises and characters, but the film goes beyond that to an extra level.Take for example the character of President Snow. In the first film, we get only fleeting glimpses of this menacing character (which, I should add, does mimic the books). In the novel, this is okay because it's from Katniss' point of view. In the film, we need an antagonist, and Donald Sutherland puts on a menacing performance in this role. In Catching Fire, we get to see that in its full development. Snow is at the same time fatherly and forbidding, gentle but powerful. He has that same appeal as Emperor Palpatine or Xerxes, ones who have no accountability and all the power and thus are beholden to no law or morality but their own. This comes through perfectly thanks to the phenomenal acting and fitting script.At the end of the day though, we get out of the house and go to the theater for a movie like this because we want to see action. It's not shameful to want to see a bit of blood and battling every now and then. Well, let's just say we are not left disappointed. The Games have taken on a whole new life in this installment, and it feels that way. In the first film, The Games are nearly quaint. It is just a simple scenario for the combatants to do what they will, free mostly from egregious deus ex situations. Primitive and effective. In the sequel, it doesn't just seem like person against person, but instead the heroes versus the machine. It is the spark of the rebellion even before it is fully revealed to us. There are enough tricks and surprises of The Games to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, wondering how our protagonists will get out of this one.Predictability is something that a film can suffer or thrive on. Have too much and your audience becomes bored, but too little and you risk raising the brow too high and going over too many heads. Catching Fire seems to find that perfect balance. I found myself often saying ""Ah, I know what's going to happen here."" and nearly immediately having it happen. I am not saying that as if I have some clairvoyant ability. What this film does it set the scenes up so tightly that you are rewarded for making guesses and allowed to feel like you've won by seeing the action in advance. It is not a cheap tactic either. They hit the mark here by giving you enough to work with but still leaving room for you to be excited and cheer when Katniss does the right thing. At the end, we are given enough of a cliffhanger leave us wanting more from the next sequel.Catching Fire is what sequels should strive to be. It didn't fall into any of the traps of a well-known series with a good original. It took what made the books and the original great and built on them. It helps that the actors seem to feel natural in their roles and with each other, likely the product of much more time working together. A perfect mix of action, thrills, mystery and socio-political drama, Catching Fire is simply altogether a great film. With this trend in the series, I am excited to see what Mockingjay has in store for me.~xx-slay-n-xx rated 9/10 on 5 May 2020"," Getting Things Right: We are now at the post Twilight/Harry Potter era, and The Hunger Games movies are the only young adult novel adaptations that have the same scale of fame of the two former series. And you know that the YA genre has become even worse nowadays; just pick up a random book, mix them with familiar elements that would please teenager hormones, and good to go. But Catching Fire is obviously different, and these are the reasons why it's much superior compared to those horrible drecks: it has strong ambition, it digs deeper within its themes, and simply tells a story. Thus it finally gets it right by deliberately showed all the interesting parts of the source material.Everyone will most likely come for the action and the romance, but unlike the last film, this one has a wiser focus: sociopolitical satires. It explores how tyrannical the Capitol government is, and how the media amazingly helps covering their corruption. The context alone is of course immediately compelling, it makes a stirring conviction why they really need to go for a revolution. While it centers Katniss who has issues of her own, her compassion towards her family, friends, and the people of Panem has always felt genuine. Those kinds of emotions work remarkably than the love triangle she's stuck into.The film once again benefits having Jennifer Lawrence in the lead. She's just incredibly engaging, that you would definitely root for all throughout. The rest of the cast remains as compelling as they were, same goes to the new ones somewhat. Francis Lawrence now handles the series. The camera may be less shaky, but there's always a sense of art in his direction, especially at the midst of silence. The pacing is effortlessly outstanding, which decently balances the drama and the thrills. The games has become a lot electrifying, it is more practical and have greater effect of danger than just characters trying to kill each other. It's a creative turn that goes full momentous until the end. The production and the effects are solid enough to make the exteriors of their world look intriguing.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has a smarter vision and finally hits the right note. The first movie was entertaining, but it hardly bothers showing the actual point of these stories other than enjoying how the games were played. This sequel filled the blanks around the setting thus tells a far more interesting story. And it sure feels like an utter miracle for an awful year for YA films, then again a great young adult book adaptations have always been rare. Overall, it's easily the best one this year, and that is all what you need to know for a while since it's kind of hard talking about it without giving much away. I can't say it's flawless, but it is generally engrossing.~billygoat1071 rated 9/10 on 22 November 2013"," This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out: From the acting to the sets to the special effects, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an exceptional film. This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out - there is plenty of story and action to fill the time. Plus, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have to carry the movie on her own. The supporting cast does an excellent job, as well. This film can't really stand on its own, but it's still a fun ride and a well-done adaptation of the book.~cricketbat rated 8/10 on 21 September 2018"," The Definition of a Good Sequel: Ever since I first saw it in theaters, Catching Fire has been one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so much better than the first one. It explores the story's political conflict more deeply and greatly expands on the dystopian universe.The new director gives it a fresh and improved vision. The first one had audiences criticizing the shaky and desaturated camerawork and this sequel fixed it. Even though one this movie involves Katniss and Peeta competing in the games again, it never feels like a repeat of the first one. They understand that viewers already know how the games work and take advantage of the chance to explore new concepts with it.Catching Fire should be an example to all filmmakers of how to do a good sequel.~michaeltobrien rated 10/10 on 2 June 2020"," A lot better than the 1!: I understand the praise definitely not among a favorite movie like someone else but quite excellent! I always appreciate Donald Sutherland his performances are superb one of the best of his was in JFK. The directing in Catching Fire is far better than part 1, Francis Lawrence is great his craft! Generally I'm not intrigued by the Hunger Games films they aren't really my cup of tea but I really like this one especially how shiny at the same it's dark too. One thing to appreciate is how these movies blossomed Jennifer Lawerence's career although Silver Lining's Playbook won her first major award. Great entertainment all around.~UniqueParticle rated 8/10 on 17 July 2023"," It's Not Battle Royale Because It's Not Supposed To Be: An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.~Mike-DD rated 7/10 on 16 March 2014"," If you loved the first one, you'll love this one...: When I went to see ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", the audience's reaction was very strange. They were angry--angry that the film ended because they really, really wanted more! The film picks up soon after Katniss and Peeta successfully survive the games. Now, they are to be wined and dined and trotted out from one publicity appearance to another. However, the President (Donald Sutherland) is angry and exactly why, Katniss doesn't understand. All she knows is that he insists that she act happier, act like she is in love with Peeta and do NOTHING to make waves...or people she loves will die! What she doesn't know at first is that throughout the world, discontent has broken out since her victory in the games--and folks see her as a person to rally about, as she is a symbol of hope. So what do you do when you have a symbol of hope? You destroy it--and the President orders a NEW game to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the games...and this game will return Katniss and Peeta to the arena to compete against 22 other Hunger Games winners! It sure seems like certain death! By the time I saw this film, a zillion other people already did. So I won't discuss the plot any further nor will I offer than in-depth a review. Suffice to say it's a very high quality film just like the first. So, even with a different director, it carries on perfectly from the last. Excellent acting, action and a wonderful plot make this one worth seeing.By the way, if you are older, you might notice that there is a huge similarity between this film and the original ""Rollerball"". Both present a world where the leaders want to destroy hope--and in both cases, a hero arises who somehow manages to overcome this nihilistic and fatalistic fate. See them both and you'll see what I mean.~planktonrules rated 9/10 on 6 March 2014"," Eight out of ten stars!: I must say, I was worried about this one. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the trilogy, but cinematically it makes absolutely no sense. The Hunger Games reads like a screenplay--Catching Fire is a meandery epic full of worldbuilding and exposition for a war that won't even begin until Mockingjay. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this installment of the hit franchise, directed by industry rookie Francis Lawrence, was maybe even more engaging than its predecessor.Visually, it is a feat. The attention to detail is remarkable. Lawrence, along with screenwriters Michael Hardt and Suzanne Collins herself, manages to weave in all of the necessary set up to the upcoming war against The Capitol without it feeling tedious or heavy-handed. The new additions to the cast, most notably Philip Seymor Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin's Finnick O'Dair, are excellent, and the dialogue is much less wooden than, forgive me, the dialogue in the books sometimes is. Moreover, it is impressive that even with so many new people and so many moving parts, the central thread of Rebellion shines through.Of course, with so much plot, so much to set up, one can hardly blame Catching Fire for falling short in the emotional department--as is, it clocks in at 2 hours and 26 minutes--but I did find myself wanting some steamier Peeta/Katniss action. I was disappointed by Lawrence's apparent disregard for the relationship between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation) and Peeta (the incomparable Josh Hutcherson). To me, Catching Fire is about Peeta. It's the Peeta show.Here's the thing: Katniss is supposed to be conflicted, not indifferent about Peeta. In the paper version, the reader, and by extension Katniss herself, feels truly torn between Gale and Peeta. She can't help but slowly fall in love with Peeta, who is so charming and funny and relentlessly Good. In this iteration, Katniss and Peeta have little to no chemistry, and Peeta only speaks when it is necessary to move the plot forward. Gale, on the other hand, is 6'4 and literally a Hemsworth. That he is a Hemsworth is no one's fault, I guess, but maybe Peeta should have been allowed to say some of the cute stuff he says in the books.The ""adults"" in the cast--Woody Harrelson's Haymitch and Donald Sutherland's President Snow have much meatier roles than they do in the books. To their credit, they are fantastic. But I can't help but wonder how much more potent this movie could have been if Lawrence had trusted his young stars a bit more with the emotional heavy lifting.Though it fell a bit short of exceptional, Catching Fire is by no means a Sophomore Slump, and I look forward to watching Mockingjay Part 1 on the big screen when it comes out!~janewickline rated 8/10 on 7 June 2020"
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - IMDb,8.1,Tom Hardy|Charlize Theron|Nicholas Hoult|Zoë Kravitz|Hugh Keays-Byrne|Josh Helman|Nathan Jones|Rosie Huntington-Whiteley|Riley Keough|Abbey Lee|Courtney Eaton|John Howard|Richard Carter|Iota|Angus Sampson|Jennifer Hagan|Megan Gale|Melissa Jaffer,George Miller,George Miller|Brendan McCarthy|Nick Lathouris,"In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in search for her homeland with the aid of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper and a drifter named Max."," Pure action spectacle: MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 24 February 2016"," Well made and mindlessly entertaining....: ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.~planktonrules rated 8/10 on 10 September 2015"," Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!: When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.~ivo-cobra8 rated 10/10 on 3 October 2015"," It Never Stops: I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.~Hitchcoc rated 5/10 on 12 October 2015"," Extremely Inflated: Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average.~Uriah43 rated 5/10 on 7 August 2015"," What A Lovely Day!: The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.~CalRhys rated NA on 25 May 2015"," An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away: Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10~stephendaxter rated 10/10 on 13 May 2015"," One of the greatest action films: George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 23 February 2020"," Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre: Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.~confrank rated 10/10 on 16 May 2015"," A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.: I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5~punishable-by-death rated 9/10 on 14 May 2015"

So it does not live up to the positive buzz from the early screenings. It's nowhere near being one of the best comic book movies of all time. It's not even in the conversation for being one of the best DC movies. But I did have a lot of fun with it.A lot may depend on your feelings of Ezra Miller. Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role.The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman.Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked.It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint.They get away with a lot with its rating including nudity and a fair amount of bad language, including the F bomb.I'm not sure if I'll watch it again, but I had a good time, watching this one time.~slightlymad22 rated 7/10 on 14 June 2023"," Come on Barbie. Let's go party?: Finally after the early screening on 6th June which showed the unfinished print, I get to watch the final cut on IMAX today. One major drawback is that a movie this big has both really good and really bad VFX. Apart from that, this complete fan service aims at not taking the story forward into the DCEU's newly planned future, instead takes Barry Allen on his usual time travel to save his mom and him learning the repercussions of his action, the hard way.This harmless PG-13 movie sticks to the basics and plays safe to the core. Adds a bunch of cameos from DC universe to get us fans riled up. The narrative ranges from meh to ""oh that's fun"" and the director Andy Muschietti hardly fails in hitting the mark. He clearly knows what he intends to do with this script and plays to it's strengths. Ezra Miller indeed is good as The Flash is an added advantage and rest Michael Keaton's return as Batman takes care off.Special mention to all the cameos as they simply were that good. Needless to say, the film is worth watching for them. Sasha Calle's Supergirl has very little to do and she tries to make most of what is offered to her. The visuals during the time travel and the reveal of multiverse was well done. The humor ensures to lighten the tone while keeping the mother-son sentiment intact. Not sure what DCEU's future holds for us fans, The Flash succeeds in entertaining for most of those 2.5hrs.~chand-suhas rated 7/10 on 15 June 2023"," Come for the fan-service, stay for the surprisingly entertaining film: I always start any review of a superhero movie by making it clear that these are not my types of movies and my opinion, for any superfans out there, should always be taken with a grain of salt. Now with that in mind, I have to say 'The Flash' is about as much as I can enjoy one of these types of movies. This was a very fun ride I'm happy to admit.The movie is basically fan-service on overdrive. Anything a mega-fan has always wanted to see is likely going to show up at some stage in this movie. If that's your kind of thing then you are going to be in heaven.I found the pacing good. The movie is just short of 2 and a half hours but that time goes by pretty quickly. As usual in these types of superhero movies I found the final battle scene the weakest the film had to offer. It got messy and convoluted and it was really the one part of the movie where I lost interest.Of all the superhero movies I've seen this is probably the one least focused on the villain. He really does feel like an after-thought more than anything. The movie is far more about Barry Allen and his mission. Which makes it surprising to me just how much I enjoyed the film, because the one thing I do often get out of these films is enjoyment from the villain.I think people are going to have a good time with this one. It doesn't feel like the usual copy and paste template that the MCU has been throwing out for 15 years now and it is certainly a step up from everything non-Batman that DC has been doing recently. I really enjoyed this. 8/10.~jtindahouse rated 8/10 on 14 June 2023"," A wildly uneven movie with shockingly bad effects: The Flash is a goofy movie. Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it's also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004's The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn't mugging for the camera, and I'd be lying if I said my childhood heart didn't surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton's Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle.~cricketbat rated 5/10 on 14 June 2023"," It just can't outrun the collapse of the DCEU.: No matter how many times you read about how awful this thing looks, trust me when I say it's worse than you're imagining. Some of these visual effects are absolutely abysmal, potentially the worst I've seen in a movie of this scale. It's honestly on the level of 'Son Of The Mask (2005)' or 'The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl 3-D (2005)' at times. Truly, truly terrible stuff. There are some sequences that are more convincing than others, but too many of them are legitimate eye sores. That's not a dig at the visual effects artists, by the way, who were all very likely doing their best with the time they were given and were also very likely underpaid for their work. It's more of a dig at the studio and its odd decision not to grant the VFX houses more time despite the fact that production on this film spanned the entire nine seasons of CW's 'The Flash (2014 - 2023)'.After a bafflingly bad opening movement, the movie does admittedly settle into its own somewhat entertaining rhythm. The second act of 'The Flash (2023)' is surprisingly successful. It isn't great, of course, but it's relatively pacy and features a handful of enjoyable action scenes. The two cameos that are spoilt in the marketing work fairly well, with a certain someone proving he's still got it even after all these years (though the actor in question has been doing good work for his entire career). Ezra Miller turns in far better work then when they played that wizard with the rubbish hair cut, somehow making Barry more irritating than before but also imbuing him with a new semblance of responsibility that ties in nicely to the story's fairy potent emotional underpinning. However, their efforts aren't quite enough to make you forget all the awful things they've done in real life (nothing would be), so there is a strange sort of second-hand guilt that arises from watching them on screen.Where the picture starts to falter once again is in its final third, which starts out modestly enough but eventually escalates into all-out insanity and begins to awkwardly explore the morally iffy side of its multiversal premise. Again, the ugly visuals rear their even uglier heads here and the very fabric of the film itself starts to (admittedly somewhat appropriately) unravel. The frustrating finale reminds you that the movie has been about IP all along, not genuine storytelling, and that any success its second act may have is either accidental or a result of it being the segment that the DC suits meddled with the least during production. Ultimately, the affair's potential is all but entirely stifled by studio-mandated audience pandering and a callously dismissive approach to the importance of a well-considered narrative.Again, some of the picture really isn't all that bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good; I honestly can't say that I didn't enjoy parts of the middle portion. However, it's bookended by some really poor storytelling and contains more than one laughably bad set-piece. The visual effects are sometimes so poor they look like they've been rendered for a cheap PlayStation 3 game. The movie just feels fairly soulless, too.If you want to see a far, far better adaptation of the Flashpoint storyline, just watch 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013)' instead.~Pjtaylor-96-138044 rated 5/10 on 25 June 2023"," Good film, let down by poor CGI: As a fan of the Flashpoint:Paradox film, i was looking forward to this. The story is similar, but does change some major parts. The Flash is, for the most part, an enjoyable film with some really good performances, especially Sasha Calle and Michael Keaton. Not a huge fan of Ezra Miller as the flash, but the biggest issue with the film is undoubtedly the CGI. At times the graphics are poor, other times they are horrendous and unnecessary. The film would have been better had they taken a bit more time with the look of the film. Overall, a decent film with some suprising cameos, some really entertaining moments, but looked cheap.~ctilly69 rated 7/10 on 16 June 2023"," Fun and Emotional: When Justice League hit theatres in 2017, I'll admit that Ezra Miller's rendition of The Flash wasn't my favourite, but his version grew on me over the years. The DC films in the last ten years have been hit or miss though. You could never tell if a film was going to be good or not. Well, hearing everything that could happen in DC's latest release, The Flash, I had to see it for myself. I'm happy to report that after seeing it and sitting on my thoughts for a couple of days, I can confidently say that this is one of DC's better films in the last 5-10 years and the emotional core packs a great punch.Having lost his mom in the past, Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) decides to use his super speed to run back in time to prevent her death and prevent his father from being wrongfully accused of her murder. In doing so, he ends up in another reality where he meets another version of himself, another version of Batman, and another version of an alien from Krypton. Also returning is the villain Zod, from the film Man of Steel. This was a fun ride to take and the action is great, but the storyline involving his mom is what worked the most for me and brought me to tears by the end. If for nothing else, the writers cared very much about the mother-son relationship.Everyone seems to be talking about how awful the CGI is as well, but I personally found certain sequences were meant to feel like an animation instead of looking realistic. Maybe that's just me, but I was able to forgive most of the effects because I felt that way. Still, I do agree some more polishing may have been needed. Still, the CGI did not take me out of the movie as some critics have been stating. In fact, without giving anything away, certain elements needed CGI that could only be done so well in the first place, so I gave them a bit of a pass. The furthest thing to think about when talking about this film is the visual effects though, so let's move on.I must say, yes it was cool to see Michael Keaton with the cape and cowl once again, but with all the cameos sprinkled throughout this film, I am starting to think I'll miss this world a bit as they get moving in another direction with DC. Although funny, this film felt most like Man of Steel in terms of care and effort being put into the story and tone. This film set out to be an emotional story before being a fan service fest, which I appreciated. All the cameos throughout the film just felt like the icing on the cake.The Flash is a film that I pretty much had no expectations for so I am surprised how much I enjoyed it. Ezra Miller carries this film with a very solid performance, Andy Muschietti delivered as director, and Christina Hodson and Joby Harold truly wrote a compelling story arc for Barry Allen. Does the film get a little much by the end and overstay its welcome in terms of bombastic visuals? Maybe, but if I'm going to nitpick that, then I have a lot of things to nitpick as well, but none of them really bothered me. I was here for a good time and I got a little more than just that, which put a big old smile on my face. If you're thinking you're interested at all based on what you've seen so far, I think you'll like this one. I recommend it.~kjproulx rated 8/10 on 19 June 2023"," Not perfect, but it is very entertaining: The Flash is a junk food movie, but sometimes junk food hits the spot. I think in this case, it kind of did, and I had fun. There are problems here for sure, and maybe it'll all fall apart in my mind the more I think about it. But I had a pretty good time with this, and while it might not have been as filling or satisfying as a proper piece of cínèmá, I feel like as far as unapologetic crowd-pleasers go, this is one of the better ones.It has fun with a time travel plot, and also dives right into all that multiverse stuff that's all the rage at this point. We may be at a breaking point soon with movies that spiral off into different universes/timelines, in the process bringing back actors to roles they haven't occupied for years or even decades, but I know I still get some enjoyment out of this kind of thing. In a couple of years, who knows - there's a good chance fatigue will set in around this latest trend, but unlike a lot of cinematic trends/sub-genres, this one has at least inspired universally loved movies and even Oscar winners (like Into the Spider-Verse and of course Everything Everywhere All At Once).The Flash is a movie that's desperate for you to like it, and I can see that turning some people off. But others are probably going to like it a lot, and I imagine it'll do well at the box office. As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time. I'm also interested to see how fans of previous DC movies react to this, given how divided the fanbase is (and how fractured all the different DC universes are, what with the extra worlds of Robert Pattinson's Batman and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker).But The Flash? It's fun. It's entertaining. It panders sometimes. It looks a bit like a video game at points (also plays out like one at times). Its humour generally lands, but not always. I'll probably never watch it again, but I had a good time watching it just this once.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 7/10 on 14 June 2023"," Overhyped, but a good film with horrible CGI.: So after being in development for years, multiple re-writes and director changes, the drama behind the film's star and with the current DC shakeup THE FLASH somehow still manages to be an okay comic-book film.You would think with all the change ups between the writers and the directors there would be some inconsistency within the film, but for the most part there wasn't. Now the hype train dubbed this as one of the greatest superhero/comic-book films ever made, and it really does not reach those heights, but it is a good entertaining film with some depth and layers.Putting aside all the Ezra Miller wrongdoings, they are very good in the film. Miller's performance in the theatrical cut of JUSTICE LEAGUE to me came off as a buffoon who made lame jokes about brunch. ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE however, that performance was more akin to what I wanted as a comic-book fan who's read Flash comics. Miller plays two versions of Barry, one older who shows more maturity and experience and one as a young teen, who is a more immature version of himself. There is a nice balance between both performances, but I will admit young Barry's antics and jokes kinda did get annoying after a while.Maribel Verdu's Nora Allen serves as Barry's motive to go back in time to save his mother. She has some good tender moments at the end when Barry does realize he needs to let her death play out. Ron Livingston replaces Billy Crudup and does a good job with the scenes he had.I've been on record saying Ben Affleck is my favorite Batman because I loved his brutality, his rage, and his merciless attitude. To me a Jim Lee drawing come to life. He's only in it in the beginning of the film where an incredibly fun action set piece takes place. If this is the last time I'll see him (which it probably will be) as the character then I'm happy I got to see him just once more.Michael Keaton definitely brought back the nostalgia. In his old age he hasn't lost a step and has a solid role within the film. Anything with him is basically fan-service on overdrive, especially the Elfman Batman score and his memorable lines from the 89 BATMAN film. Since it is the mutliverse keep an eye out for some cameos near the climax. Sasha Calle steps into the role of Supergirl and I didn't mind her presence or performance but she was just kinda there. She plays an important part, but it never marinated enough for it to feel any true weight, but to mainly be there to serve the action at the end. She does have a nice fight with Michael Shannon's Zod.Piggybacking off that, I really did like how director Andy Muschietti honored what came before with what Zack Snyder did. He didn't blatantly ignore it which I appreciated. So even if seeing Affleck, Shannon, and some other familiar Snyder-Verse cast members for just a quick bit, it was nice that there was an acknowledgment of what came before.Now the VFX are very questionable. I know Muschietti said that the VFX was meant to look weird on purpose and I get his reasoning behind it, but it just looked way too wonky. Distractingly wonky that it took me out of the film from time to time.As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Original set photos showed Supergirl and Keaton's Batman showing up at the end, but that has changed. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time.To sum it up, THE FLASH is an overhyped film that just happens to be a good/entertaining spectacle with a narrative that isn't exactly new, but the nuances give it that extra flare that prevents it from being a total nostalgia bait/fan service.7/10.~drawlife rated 7/10 on 16 June 2023"," Mediocre and overrated: When I read about all the stuff that Ezra was accused of I was kind of shocked, but the. Obviously he's a box ticker and not charges happened so this film came out. The fact they stood by him made me think this performance would be mind blowing.It's not, at best he'd be a side kick, he tries the Tom Holland stuff which is already pretty tedious, his voice is nasally sounding and monotonous. He hasn't got a great range of expressions, I just thought he was definitely replaceable, I'd not be desperate to get him back, he had no chemistry with anyone and just felt out his depth. I don't get what he was doing with the performance.Some of the cameos were cool, film is way too long, drags in parts and it's a very weak story for such a long film, the emotional stuff kinda works as the mom is great. But this is one of the worst superhero movies I've seen, along with venom 2 and immortals.Cgi was terrible, games do it better.~chris_rowe-881-168820 rated 4/10 on 18 June 2023"
