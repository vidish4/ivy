The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) - IMDb,6.9,Rachel Zegler|Tom Blyth|Viola Davis|Dexter Sol Ansell|Rosa Gotzler|Clemens Schick|Fionnula Flanagan|Hunter Schafer|Ashley Liao|Athena Strates|Joshua Kantara|Am√©lie Hoeferle|Kaitlyn Akinpelumi|Florian Burgkart|Ayomide Adegun|Aaron Finn Schultz|Max Raphael|Mekyas Mulugeta,Francis Lawrence,Michael Lesslie|Michael Arndt|Suzanne Collins,Coriolanus Snow mentors and develops feelings for the female District 12 tribute during the 10th Hunger Games.," This installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown: My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.~kevin_robbins rated 5/10 on 20 November 2023"," Long, Boring and not needed.: No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.~skylermoore rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023"," Not On Par: In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.~Tweetienator rated 4/10 on 21 November 2023"," Welcome to the 10th Annual Boring Games... I mean Hunger Games: I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.~nscoby93 rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Incredibly faithful to the book: Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.~vitordrios rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Prequel that tries to show some of the history of the fictional world, but remains somewhat unnecessary.: The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 4/10 on 19 November 2023"," A sure misfire!: I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.~gabriel-80 rated 5/10 on 15 November 2023"," This certainly does not catch fire.: It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Disappointment: I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.~ArchilArjevanidze rated 3/10 on 17 November 2023"," Pleasantly Surprised: I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?~dannibairstow rated 8/10 on 26 November 2023"
Napoleon (2023) - IMDb,6.6,Joaquin Phoenix|Vanessa Kirby|Tahar Rahim|Rupert Everett|Mark Bonnar|Paul Rhys|Ben Miles|Riana Duce|Ludivine Sagnier|Edouard Philipponnat|Miles Jupp|Scott Handy|Youssef Kerkour|John Hollingworth|Abubakar Salim|Thom Ashley|Jannis Niew√∂hner|Julian Rhind-Tutt,Ridley Scott,David Scarpa,"An epic that details the checkered rise and fall of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his wife, Josephine."," A few words of warning for those with high expectations...: A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 23 November 2023"," An interesting failure: Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.~petra_ste rated 6/10 on 3 December 2023"," My biggest disappointment this year: Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.~MissSimonetta rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep: Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better.~Vic_max rated 6/10 on 22 November 2023"," Knew it was Bad. Even so, Surprised at HOW bad.: I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.~levybob rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Awful.: What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.~krzysiektom rated 2/10 on 26 November 2023"," Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies: Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Jos√©phine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Jos√©phine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Jos√©phine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you¬¥re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up.~epicking rated 3/10 on 23 November 2023"," BAD, REALLY BAD, TERRIBLY BAD, AND I WILL EXPLAIN: First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.: Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.~dhunjiwadia rated 5/10 on 26 November 2023"," Bring on the director's cut!: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.~zeki-4 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"
The Zone of Interest (2023) - IMDb,8.0,Sandra H√ºller|Christian Friedel|Freya Kreutzkam|Ralph Herforth|Max Beck|Imogen Kogge|Ralf Zillmann|Stephanie Petrowitz|Christopher Manavi|Nele Ahrensmeier|Luis Noah Witte|Zuzanna Kobiela|Johann Karthaus|Daniel Holzberg|Julia Polaczek|Medusa Knopf|Lilli Falk|Marie Rosa Tietjen,Jonathan Glazer,Martin Amis|Jonathan Glazer,"The commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H√∂ss, and his wife Hedwig, strive to build a dream life for their family in a house and garden next to the camp."," A Haunting and Unflinching Portrait of Evil: The Zone of Interest, the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, is a harrowing and disturbing drama that explores the lives of the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H√∂ss, and his wife Hedwig, who live in a house and garden next to the camp. Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the H√∂ss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the H√∂sses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra H√ºller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf H√∂ss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. H√ºller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends.~ergo-58534 rated 10/10 on 12 July 2023"," Life near Auschwitz, told in hushed tones: This incandescent film portrays the idyllic life that the family of Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss enjoyed in a sumptuous house right next to the concentration camp in Auschwitz right in the middle of the Holocaust. There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout.We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination.A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire. But overall, this is an extraordinary and memorable film from start to finish. Recommended to everyone, without exception.~PotassiumMan rated 9/10 on 17 December 2023"," Subtlety at its Finest: An absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that challenges and provokes the audience, while also depicting a morbid yet enticingly original perspective on the most infamous and horrific tragedy of all time. Johnathon Glazer's Zone of Interest is not a film to merely watch, but rather one to be absorbed. A paradoxical film, where the most important and powerful images are the ones we never get to see.The concept of the withholding of art being the overarching meaning behind the work certainly isn't reinventing the wheel, but Glazer's presentation and execution puts a spin on the concept in such a unique and cryptic way, it will have you asking yourself if such an idea can ever be done in cinema again.The ""withholding"" begins with the opening of the film. Before the title is flashed onto screen, the audience is treated to a 3-minute synthetic overture in total darkness. A choice that will have you wondering if the projectionist forgot to take off the camera lid. While from a distance it may come across as a mundane or pretentious decision from an amateur director, Glazer is already subjecting the audience to the ethos of his film. The focus is on what we don't see.As Mica Levi's haunting, Aphex Twin remiscent score comes to a close, we are treated to the first image of the film, the H√∂ss family. And for the next 2 hours, we are treated to only images of the H√∂ss family. Never once do we as an audience get to actually witness the horrors of what lies beyond the concentration camp walls. However, that does not mean we are spared.Throughout the film, we feel the effects of the Holocaust without ever truly seeing it. Whether it be the blood-orange glow of the burnt Jewish bodies from the Auschwitz chimney being cast through the window pane of Hedwig H√∂ss' (Sandra Hu√´ller) upstairs guest room. The dichotomy of the Hoss children's playful laughs paired against the sorrowful howls of the tortured souls of the next door death camp. Or the dust remains of decayed Jewish skeletons dumped into the nearby river, ruining Rudolph H√∂ss' (Christian Friedel) canoe adventure with his children. Suffering is felt at every corner of this film. Glazer masterfully crops out the harsh images of the Holocaust, but keeps them just close enough so their presence is still unavoidable. A feeling of historical tragedy that still rings true today.The film is a slow-burn, to say the least. There's never truly an inciting incident, an overly graphic scene of violence, or even really a definitive plot.Yet that is where the art of this film lies, in its subtlety.By introducing images and story-lines that are never fully realized, finished, or even acknowledged, Glazer keeps the audience on its toes by providing only a short glimpse into this family's life, all paired against the gargantuan looming walls of Auschwitz. We see young romance, joust between siblings, and family values, all without ever really learning anything about the family. We are never directly given names, ages, what their hobbies or interests are. Only minute glances at what middle-upper class German family life in the 40s would be ... next to a death camp of course.Oh yeah, the H√∂ss family's idyllic suburban home with 6 rooms and a garden that rivals that of Francis Hodgson Burnett's, is built directly next to the infamous Auschwitz death camp. A property line that excites the family, Rudolph in particular.Rudolph, or Rudy as his wife likes to call him, is the patriarch of the family. A high-ranking officer for the Third Reich, he is one of the head guards at Auschwitz. He is a cold-blooded methodical man, who focuses on efficiency, and has a true love for his work. His wife on the other hand, Hedwig, is a high-ranking officer in an of herself. She runs the H√∂ss family establishment, caring for 5 rambunctious children, enlisting the help of local girls for household duties, and doing whatever necessary to achieve the dream life she had ever since she was a girl, a big house and family.This description of a traditional working man, a traditional wife and their traditional family doesn't sound like much to chew on, but with the next door screams of the innocent reminding the audience who this family is, the film could not feel more tense. To portray a family of Nazis as just your average boring family, reminiscent of an American family in the 50s, is daring, to say the least. But this is exactly Glazer's intention, to bring a perspective on tragedy we have never seen before. One that, from a distance, doesn't seem harmful. But on a closer inspection, finding that the distance is the harm.Glazer however, doesn't only ever submit the audience to monotonous montages of basic family life, though it is prevalent. He instead uses the effect of monotony to then surprise his audience with choices an ideas that would never be seen in a period piece. Every so often, the film will deliver a cryptic sequence or audio effect that is a complete betrayal of the historical drama formula. The first, and most reoccurring of which, being an inverted color, night vision setting on the camera. Without warning, the film will switch to this bizarre camera setting, breaking away from the established world of the film. This subversion adds to the artistic and innovative vision of Glazer, while also avoiding gimmick.The film also has an incredible use of sound design, straying away from historical drama cliches. Rather than including songs or sounds from the 40s, Glazer utilizes the work of sound designer Johnnie Burns to craft a heavy and electronic approach that adds an incredible depth to the film. The sound bellows throughout the theatre and shakes you to your very core. This choice proves to be another masterful decision by Glazer, as it amplifies an undeniable sense of impending doom and scale that no other design could depict.The Zone of Interest is one of the most intrinsically haunting pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Its performances, originality, and lead by Johnathon Glazer undeniably makes it the best from Cannes, and one of the best films I've seen in the past decade, if not the best. Its subtlety, unique perspective, and daring choices creates a breathtaking atmosphere and movie-going experience. It's as impressive as a film can get, and represents a true understanding and mastering of cinema as an art form.10 out of 10.~townsend_reviews rated 10/10 on 29 May 2023"," The Zone of Interest: Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf H√∂ss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra H√ºller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.~CinemaSerf rated 7/10 on 23 November 2023"," One of the most boring movies I've ever seen: Yes it's very very boring, nothing happens the first 45 minutes. Just mundane everyday things in the life of Nazi Germans. The only tension came when we thought they might have to move. This movie is living proof that tension is what makes a strong story and keeps audiences engaged. I actually fell asleep for the last 2/4 of the movie. I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas? I should research this more, but the buildings were all so much prettier than I've seen in historical photos.~Hopedoesnotdie rated 7/10 on 5 December 2023"," Great concept, lazy execution: Caught this at the LFF. As a student of Judaism, the theme of the Holocaust passionates me, and the premise of the film seemed brilliant, and I was really looking forward to it. I started to have a slight suspicion when we were treated to five minutes of a black screen with ominous music just after the opening credits.To be fair, the film does have some amazing ideas; all four of them would have made a wonderful, thought-provoking twenty minute short. As a feature film, they are not enough. After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore.~bjacob rated 4/10 on 12 October 2023"," Vacuous piece of self-indulgence: Watched this at its premiere in Cannes without any expectations whatsoever. The premise looks interesting: the head of Auschwitz lives a very paradoxically normal life with his family just behind the wall that separates them from the camp. So normal that it's filled with endless scenes of them eating, brushing their teeth, kids playing, parents reading, even sleeping while nothing else happens. Just as exciting as life in the 40's. And... that's it ! Once in a while, you can barely hear an execution or a scream on the other side of the wall while the family hardly notices at all. What is happening then is left to the viewer's imagination. Throw in some experimental, ominous and unfitting electronic music and occasional uninspired video art gimmicks and you've got a movie. There were enough ideas for a 5mn short film but it looks like the director tried his hardest to extend it into a full-length feature by all means. That was definitely not necessary. He even seemed to notice something else HAD to happen so he found something to spike this giant snoozefest a little bit: Will the husband accept to be mutated somewhere else with a higher rank ? His wife doesn't want him to, she's happy with her family life, while he's hesitant and hopes to convince the kommandantur that he can stay where they are. Big suspense. Not. Because nobody cares.This is not a difficult film to watch because of its supposed tension (there is hardly any despite all the efforts - just go spend a weekend in the German or Austrian countryside and you'll feel just the same) but because it's unbelievably boring, uneventful and empty with shockingly stale dialogue (when there is any). Glazer is no Hitchcock, Bergman or Argento. The raving reviews can only come from people who will praise anything related to the horrors of the Holocaust. This film has nothing.~Topher-26 rated 1/10 on 8 October 2023"," Much less subtle than it thinks: This is an exceptionally disappointing film, misleading historically and dramatically empty, with a boring screenplay. It wants to make a point about the proximity of Rudolf Hoss's house to the suffering victims of Nazism, but it gives no proper impression of the geography of the Auschwitz complex. Thus we see the tops of the well built Austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I, but nothing at all of Birkenau, a mile away, where the worst horrors unfolded. It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all. For the rest, the scenes are nicely shot but lacking in cinematic or dramatic interest.~D-C-S-Turner rated 2/10 on 14 October 2023"," Misleading and dull: Presumably those who made this thought they were being subtle but all they have done is produce more holocaust porn. First, they get the geography of the Auschwitiz complex all wrong. Yes Hoss's house was very close to Auschwitz I but the real horrors in 1943 were happening at Birkenau a mile away. In any case showing the top half of the very well built austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I all the time makes it seem like aregular prison. The train sounds in the backrgound are not those of a train slowing down. Hoss is presented at the end as a man with a conscience, throwing up at the prosoect of killing 700,000 hungarians. He had no conscience at all. At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs.Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong.~D-C-S-Turner rated 2/10 on 13 October 2023"," Read the book or wait to stream it at home for free!: Out of 8 people in the theatre this afternoon, 6 of us hung around in the lobby to talk about the film. We all felt the same way .... sooo boring!! After 25 minutes of commercials and we finally get the Feature Presentation sign then we get over 3 minutes of a black screen. We thought it more like 5 but usher said it was 3.Film finally starts with banal chat by the banks of a river with family fishing, swimming and beach type activities.

He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!~tkarlmann rated 10/10 on 27 February 2020"," Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace: In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (M√©lanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.~SnoopyStyle rated 8/10 on 30 May 2014"," Oh! What a Lovely War...: There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion.~Xstal rated 9/10 on 20 November 2022"," Glorious indeed!: Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.~ruelshepperd rated 9/10 on 12 December 2021"," Tarantino's best? I think so: No joke ‚Äì I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.From then on in, we're involved in a film which uses long scenes of dialogue and character interaction as a way to build the utmost suspense. Suspense plays a big part in this film's effectiveness, and nowhere else is it better than in the basement bar sequence around halfway through: this 20-minute segment is one of my favourite scenes in a film, where great direction, scripting, and acting all combine to make a masterful moment. The cast is excellent: Brad Pitt and Eli Roth headline the titular squad of soldiers, on hand to lend some much needed humour (usually of the pitch-black variety) to the film, while Diane Kruger shows how much she's matured as an actress by playing a double agent. Michael Fassbender reminds us why he's a rising star with his turn as British officer Archie Hickox, and even a cameoing Mike Myers doesn't ruin things. Only Tarantino would cast the long-forgotten Rod Taylor as Churchill, but it's a move that pays off.In the end, though, it's the unknown European actors who really make this work. Christoph Waltz deserves his Oscar as the impeccably mannered Nazi officer, an utterly horrifying creation; Melanie Laurent delights by providing the movie's emotional core. And the little turns, from Til Schweiger's psychotically vengeful German soldier to August Diehl's slimy SS officer, are also perfectly judged. Throw in some snippets of outrageous violence to break the tension, add in a bravura climax that, for once, doesn't let the viewer down, and you have a film that's quickly become a new favourite of mine.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 5 August 2016"," I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.: This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.~laurabethc1 rated 10/10 on 7 February 2020"," People seem to be missing the point: This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.~ablewuzi rated 10/10 on 10 July 2012"," Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?: That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.~paulmuehlendahl rated 10/10 on 25 August 2009"," My Favorite Tarantino Film: What's better than dudes killin Nazis?It is no surprise to say that this film is indeed a masterpiece of cinema. Not only in terms of writing, but the acting and execution as well. It uses every element of film in order to create tension and suspense mainly through the use of dialogue and camera work. There are multiple scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat simply because two people are having a conversation. My friend who had just seen the film for the first time calls it ""Tension: The Movie.""When it comes to atmosphere, Tarantino is the king at creating suspense and tension in a scene. I've never seen a war film like this. It's able to balance action, comedy and drama perfectly.This film has one of my favorite opening scenes of all time. Tarantino's writing combined with Christoph Waltz genius acting and they can make any conversation seem like the most interesting thing in the world. This opening scene is both intriguing and extremely tense and grabs the attention of the viewer right away. Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing in this film. He feels like a genuine psychopath. The character of Hans Landa is extraordinary. I also really liked the character of Shoshanna. Being a Jew myself it is awesome seeing all these Nazi's get killed by this vengeful girl. I couldn't help but feel for Shoshanna. She was definitely one of the best characters in the film with a great arc. The way she goes out is brutal. Daniel Bruhl was also great in this movie. Poor guy had PTSD and just wanted some.The characters within the Basterds are great as well. Specifically Brad Pitt and Eli Roth. The Bear Jew was awesome and the scene where we are first introduced to him really hypes him up and it doesn't disappoint. Such a well filmed scene. It really is hard not to laugh or smile when the Bear Jew starts swingin the bat. Michael Fassbender is in this film and I was surprised that he wasn't in it longer. But, his scenes were really good and he does a great job. In fact that scene in the basement bar is one of the best if not the best scene in the film. Literally every scene is so well written and interesting. There are no scenes that drag and everything that is shown or said has a purpose.Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It is one of the most well written films i've ever seen. All the performances are amazing, the script is fantastic, and the direction is perfect. I don't have any flaws for this film. It is one of my favorite films of all time. It is so extremely well thought out. All the characters are interesting. The opening scene is one of the best in film, and the entire third act is just perfect. In fact the whole film is honestly a perfect movie. It is also extremely rewatchable. Which is hard for a movie that is this long. But, it is so entertaining you will genuinely enjoy it with each watch.This is what moviemaking is all about. Exceeding audience expectations and keeping the viewer entertained throughout while delivering a great story. That is art. As Aldo says in the final line of the movie, ""This just might be my masterpiece."" And honestly Tarantino, I think it is. *chefs kiss*~BenjaminPopkin rated 10/10 on 30 March 2022"," World War II In an Alternate Universe: I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task. What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.~bkoganbing rated 8/10 on 8 September 2009"

So, consequently I love the first two Expendables. Great action masterpieces. Third one was bland because a great mistake: PG-13. Then we got this abomination that has nothing to do with the spirit of the Expendables movies. I don't know how to start but I'll try.First, the Fx's are horrible. Why? The movie has the graphics of my PC from 1996. I mean VGA level. How is it possible to approve an action movie that looks so cheap?... Stallone's action movies are always great in action, Fx's and choreographies. What happened here?...Second, the cast looks more tired than my grandmother, she is 92. Dolph Lundgren is excusable because his illness, but what about the others?...Anyway, I can keep going but it is not necessary. If you love the first two Expendables just watch it again. Avoid this cr@p. The franchise is absolutely destroyed.~danielcereto rated 3/10 on 13 October 2023"," 2023's biggest turkey.: An awful film, one that actually makes a mockery of The Cinema, anyone that watches trash like this, isn't going to rush back, for fear of having to sit through junk like this again.An estimated budget of $100 million, if I waste money at work, I'd be sacked, you can only imagine the fallout od this movie for those st the top.Excruciating viewing, I watched it because of an admiration for the first film, but this, I'm embarrassed for them, this is the worst film I've seen so far this year, it made Strays seem like a classic.The only plus I can highlight, Jason Statham did at least try, he adds a few moments of humour, and does at least have some degree of sincerity. Now I know that both Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren have their fans, but their acting here, I'm not sure if wooden or diabolical spring to mind, my heart sinks to think what this turkey has done to both careers.The script was woeful, and some of the dialogue had me cringing in my seat. Worst of all, The CGI, what on Earth were they thinking, it looks abysmal, where did the budget go, I'm assuming it's on the salaries.Atrocious.3/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 3/10 on 27 September 2023"," Who is this for?!: This sequel nearly a decade in the making clearly isn't made for long-suffering fans of this franchise, as most of the iconic cast barely has any screen time. The title should've been ""Jason Statham and some of the Expendables.""And this also isn't made for people who like dumb cheesy action movies, as this movie plays it completely straight most of the time, rarely allowing campiness to show.It also isn't made for people who like slick, cool action movies, as director Scott Waugh continues this series' streak of having directors who can barely string a coherent series of shots together to tell a story. Nearly every shot looks cheap and the progression of events is clunky as hell.Woeful incompetence is how I'd describe most of what's seen in this film. It truly has some of the worst special effects I've ever seen put to screen. And it still cost $100 million.So, I ask again, who is this for? Whose idea was it to make an action sequel that will appeal to absolutely NONE of its potential audiences?If it weren't for the fact that this movie does have a half-decent third act and one impressive fight scene, I'd be saying that this is easily the worst of these movies.But it's a contender for that title, and even so, I can still say this is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen in theatres.~benjaminskylerhill rated 3/10 on 22 September 2023"," Dull action and cgi infested sequel that lost its steam.: 2.5 out of 5 stars.The Expendables 4 is a pretty bad action film that is a franchise that is supposed to have a stardom of actors and brutal action flick that pays homage to the 80s action films. This sequel falls off that list.Plot is thin and forgettable. A predictable twist to the villain.The cast ensemble is thin. Jason Statham is on the spotlight and taking the lead role which is great. While Stallone is sitting majority of the film out. Dolph Lundgren and Randy Coulture being the only original cast was okay. While new faces like 50 Cent, Jacob Scipio, Levy Tran, Iko Uwais, Tony Jaa, and Megan Fox are all decent. Mostly everyone is under utilized on screen while the action focuses on Statham.The film has plenty of action sequences. The direction relies heavily on cgi on the action which nothing is as practical compared to the other films. The bad thing is the cgi is horrible. Most explosions looks like a bad video game effects. The fight scenes are cluttered. The director Scott Waugh did a poor job in handling the action sequences and giving every talent a spotlight in the action.Overall, it is one of the worst Expendables film alongside the third film which the series is running on fumes.~cruise01 rated 5/10 on 23 September 2023"," Bad action movie. Waste of time and money for an empty theater!: I can't believe they pulled a fast and furious fake death plot device, but I should've expected it at this point. This franchise needs to end after this movie for sure. I only saw this because I actually liked the first 3 (because of how fun they were, and this movie barely has any of the fun those movies had and shouldn't have been made, doesn't feel like the other 3 at all). It had almost no redeeming qualities. I guess I'll give it props for maybe a couple good action sequences and stunts (plus Levy Tran was hot) but that's all.Megan Fox is suddenly a high ranked Expendable, why? Where did she come from all of the sudden?? All the cringe dialogue and gross sexual jokes that weren't even funny? Please. A villain that wasn't interesting too, too much shaky cam directing, and a waste of Sylvester Stallone. I guess also if you like Jason Statham you'd like this movie but for real, wasn't enough for me.

Some of the action scenes were good but the shift from a team of Special Ops to a single operative made it feel stale and like every other action movie and didn't allow for any character development of the new team members or villains. The CGI was very bad and made all the big events look cartoony, the camaraderie between the stars was painful to watch and how they ended it all was unbelievably bad. Thankfully, it wasn't too long, but I really hope they don't make another one.~sbweightman rated 2/10 on 22 September 2023"," A Movie That Needed A Better Director: A film that should have been better, but unfortunately had a mediocre director.Not everything in the movie is bad, but overall this could have been a great movie.Well, let's start with the good stuff:Jason Statham works well in an action movie as usual. Stallone is in his element, although it would be better if he was a little more in the film. Iko Uwais is not bad at all as a villain and he is a good addition to the film. Andy Garcia is also a good choice for this movie. The rest of the team is mostly good, with a few exceptions, some should have maybe gotten a little more time in the movie.And now, the bad part:The biggest problem with this movie is the mediocre director. If they had a better director, this film could have been great, it turned out to be just tolerable, and that's because most of today's film production is garbage.There is too much ""shaky camera"" that makes every movie look worse than it really is. Such scenes simply look cheap.The CGI looks pretty bad, which is odd considering this isn't a cheap movie, but a bad director made it look cheap.The film lacks that real cinematic look, I don't know if it's because of the type of camera, so everything looks too artificial, it doesn't have the look that older films had, where everything looked monumental. This looks like a documentary, with ultra-sharp resolution, and yet it looks cheap, as if we're looking through a window.Basically, the director is the worst thing about this movie, everything else is not nearly as bad, not even some really hilarious casting choices.In the end, the film could have been great, it turned out to be just another mediocre film, and it's sad that even as such it is better than most of what ""modern film production"" offers us today.~dk777 rated 6/10 on 17 October 2023"," I walked out halfway through this absolute mess of an action flick...: This movie is so tedious and stupid, I couldn't take anymore and ended up walking out. The action is bad, the acting is bad, the CGI is atrocious, the direction is limp, the story is scattershot and lacking any sense. This has got to be Sylvester Stallone's worst film so far.Even the unrelenting violence wasn't enough to keep me interested. Yes, there is plenty of violence, blood sprays and some gore thrown in all over the film. Does any of it make an impact though? No, not one bit. Could care less that they just decapitated a guy with a lightpost, or that the bad guy keeps stabbing everyone with his pointy sticks. Probably because it's all stuff I have seen before in much better flicks than this.Also, Megan Fox is an abysmal actress. Anytime she is on screen, I was hoping she was the next one to die. I didn't finish the film, nor will I, but I geniunely hope she bites the dust by the end. Not saying anyone else was any better. The only actors here who seemed to care they were in this film were Jason Statham and Iko Uwais. Worst of all is Iko Uwais is an excellent Indonesian actor who probably doesn't know English very well, therefore would have no idea that the lines he's being force fed are some of the worst/corniest lines written for a villian in quite a long time.Overall, an abysmal attempt at revitalizing a franchise that should have been buried after the first one.

A pledge. A commitment.: Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is a great movie with an interesting story on an important subject matter. It has some intense action scenes and many moments of suspense. The music is fantastic, elevating every scene. That's now three movies where I've noticed a great musical score by composer Christopher Benstead, along with Wrath of Man and Operation Fortune.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as usual. The surprise stand out is Dar Salim, who did a great job of getting me invested in his character and wellbeing. I wish Antony Starr (The Boys, Banshee) had a bigger role, but it was cool to see him have scenes with a star of Gyllenhaal's caliber. He's such a great actor and I continue to wait for him to get major movie roles.I'm impressed with the subject matter covered here. It's so sad and needs to be addressed. It's not the first time the American government has broken promises or shirked responsibilities resulting in catastrophic outcomes for the people who put their trust in them. Some people will immediately call you unpatriotic for even bringing this up. But wrong is wrong, regardless of who does it.(1 viewing, opening Thursday 4/20/2023)~FeastMode rated 7/10 on 21 April 2023"," Not The Movie You Think It Will Be--But An Even Better One: Though I am most certainly a ""dove"" when it comes to my opinions on war and the military industrial complex, I also recognize that it is important to hear the stories of the individuals who do choose to serve in the armed forces, as their bravery is beyond question. An actor like Jake Gyllenhaal certainly draws me to projects like this, and here teamed up with director Guy Ritchie ""The Covenant"" is a film that subverts expectations at every turn but ultimately ends up being better for it every time.For a very basic overview (one that will include some spoilers simply by nature of the film's changing arcs), this movie tells the story of Master Sergeant John Kinley (Gyllenhaal) in the later years of the Afghanistan war (roughly 2018). Kinley's company is assigned an interpreter--Ahmed (Dar Salim)--who is an expert at his craft but often takes matters into his own hands (very strong-willed, in other words). After a series of relatively normal (if inane) patrols for Taliban weapons, one such outing goes south quickly and both Kinley & Ahmed are left stranded. With a wounded Kinley on death's doorstep, Ahmed's heroic survival efforts lead to their safety. Kinley survives and is sent back home--but then discovers that the visa promised to Ahmed & family has not been executed. In extreme emotional torment at this treatment of his literal savior, Kinley tries to navigate the military bureaucracy but realizes that he may have to return to Afghanistan to get the job done himself.One of the clear hallmarks of ""The Covenant"" is how it never quite turns out to be the movie you expect. At first, it presents as a pretty standard ""root out the bad guys"" flick. Then, it transitions into an escape/survival mission. When that comes to a close, there are a solid 45-or-so minutes of runtime left, those being devoted to Kinley trying to honor the bond he (and the U. S. military, by extension) made with Ahmed that isn't being honored. In less capable hands this shifting could be disastrous, but Ritchie executes it nearly flawlessly.It helps, of course, to have the extremely talent (yet seemingly still always a bit underrated) Gyllenhaal in the leading role. Not only can he more than pull off the action/stunt sequences convincingly, but his tremendous everyman, character-actor persona carries the back portion of the film. Viewers are utterly dependent on identifying with Kinley's emotional torment at the thought of Ahmed not being properly treated, and Jake has no problem making that happen.Finally, the over-arcing message of the film is subtle enough to not be over-bearing in any way but also present just enough to not seem vapid. Though portraying the horrors (both physical and psychological) of combat, it also muses upon the experience of establishing a military presence in a country, making commitments to those societies, and then ultimately leaving and seeing much progress lost. In this way, ""The Covenant"" is a deep-thinking film without any pompous or deep-thinking speeches to pull it off.To be honest, I had nothing other than Jake G. And positive word-of-mouth drawing me to ""The Covenant"". But I'm glad I saw it, as it was a fascinating glimpse in the Afghanistan war both in micro and macro capacities.~zkonedog rated 9/10 on 10 May 2023"," Literally two great movies for the price of one.: When Guy Ritchie out-Guy Ritchie's a Guy Ritchie film and finally again gives us the great filmmaking that made Guy Ritchie a great filmmaker. I can actually forgive Ritchie now for his Operation Fortune nonsense.The first hour of this film alone was a great war-action film. It could've ended at that hour and I would've been fully satisfied, impressed and entertained. Then we get the bonus last hour of a separate recon and rescue mission mostly undertaken by one soldier, another epic film on its own.Combine both stories, and you get a flawless film from every aspect, and one that is timely and hits home with a reality check on a bond, a pledge and a commitment. From the stellar directing to the near-perfect screenwriting (aside from nicknaming soldiers in the opening scene with ridiculous names, when those same soldiers become insignificant after half an hour into the film), excellent cinematography, spot-on score - especially the last 15 mins, and stellar casting with outstanding performances by everyone especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. The running time and pacing were perfect - I actually wanted more. The two hours were pure adrenaline as the remarkable and highly emotional journey unfolded.

But all of it was so thoroughly investing that it didn't bother me.And although a great deal of that set-up feels too rote, too similar to the many other war films seen in the last 20 years, The Covenant quickly carves out a thoroughly distinct feel for itself as it establishes its central theme of the indebtedness that comes with a spiritual bond people feel to each other.Gyllenhaal is great as always, but the show-stealing star of this film is Dar Salim as Ahmed. He gives this film its emotional teeth and causes its hook of tension to sink into you and not let go till the end.The pulse-pounding musical score and Ritchie's refreshingly restrained direction allow this film to truly have far more staying power than most run-of-the-mill war films.~benjaminskylerhill rated 8/10 on 21 April 2023"," A Cinematic Experience!: Also known as 'Guy Ritchie's The Covenant', the film unfortunately flopped at the box office, which is interesting considering the film received mainly positive reviews from both audiences and critics.As for me, I absolutely loved it! 'The Covenant' is a war film that finally effectively portrays loyalty to the extreme. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Sergeant John Kinley, who goes to Afghanistan on a mission to look for Taliban firearms. This after his unit was ambushed and one of their trucks bombed by the Taliban, resulting in the death of his interpreter.John now has a new interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim), who previously worked for the Talliban. What happens next, is an incredible story of survival against all odds. How do I possibly review this without doing spoilers? Ahmed becomes much more than just John's interpreter, when he goes beyond the call of duty to keep him alive.Weeks later, when John regains consciousness and learns Ahmed is still in Afghanistan, having to move underground with his family, John wants to do everything in his power to return the favour by saving Ahmed. It is an almost impossible task that very well could cost him his life, and Ahmed's.'The Covenant' is a touching, emotional and inspirational journey. It is nail-biting from beginning to end, with superb performances - especially Dar Salim as Ahmed! He was incredible and I hope he received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The film also has an awesome score, and great cinematography. This film is a cinematic experience. It was simply STUNNING!~paulclaassen rated 8/10 on 2 September 2023"," Hits hard and lingers on...: I no idea how strongly Guy Ritchie genuinely feels about the grave wrongs that the US and UK military have done to interpreters in both Afghanistan and Iraq in recent conflicts but, if The Covenent is anything to go by, he's pretty pissed. And rightly so. The promises made to these individuals in an effort to get them to behave against the best interests of both them and their families needed to be honoured. In this story and in many real life cases, they weren't. That is shameful.Jake Gyllenhaal is his usual reliable self, turning in a performance dripping in both commitment and duty. He's a good man and he's gonna do the right thing, no matter how far that necessitates he goes. Dar Salim - a new name to me - is an utter revelation as Ahmed, the bitter but pragmatic interpreter who puts his life on the line countless times to...yes, do the right thing.The impact that war and each other have on these men's lives is at the very heart of this story. Though not based on any real incident to the best of my knowledge, this movie is testament to many real life situations that I have no doubt still keep men awake at night. It's an important movie and almost certainly a career high for all involved.~gillespiesan rated 9/10 on 8 June 2023"," Great war movie. G.R. and cast did an exceptional work!: First, actors - you can't go wrong with Jake Gyllenhaal. But all others did a great job! It is a realistic movie, with excellent action moments. What is a sad thing to know is that this is someone's reality! I will not play idealist and dream of a world of peace, but my goodness, thinking this is someone's day, week, .... year! Uh! The movie is produced at the highest level. From gear to each and every element. Actors probably had training of some sort. You can see it when and how they hold a gun, move in close combat... This is one fantastic movie. The soundtrack brings sadness, and some scenes with a translator... This is a well-made movie, a true army flick, made by real men for men!

This is not an action movie. This is cathartic experience of the releasing of a bond of sacrifice, honor and humanity. Take out all the all guns and violence and you are left with two men who went through hell together and once you go on that journey you don't come out the other side until both of you are resting at home in bed with your families. There is no need to explain anything to us. Guy Ritchie manages to show us a story in such a nuanced why, the the interpreter not only interprets language, he interprets eyebrow movements, the shape of some ones smile, a little look there. In fact a good interpreter is one that can interpret what is not said and what is not done in the correct way. The actor who plays Ahmed was absolutely engrossing, he was able to draw us in and care about who story merely by the way he shows us, not even what he says and does, I really hope he gets recognition for this film, maybe even a Best Supporting Actor Nod. Jake Gylenhall was flawless as always. You felt the hook that was in him, like it was a real physical thing and he heeded to take out, otherwise he would not live in peace and be only half a man by not fulfilling his commitment, a commitment not spoken about it words but in sacrifice. I put this film in the same class of great Afghanistan war movies as 'Lone Survivor' (2013) as one of the best films ever made about the war in a Afghanistan. Long after the credit roll you are still left with their stories stuck in your head.

It's hilarious and moving and the acting is phenomenal. I'm really surprised it doesn't have a higher rating, it feels like it's a wonderful classic. Definitely watch it!~JeopardyLeyton rated 10/10 on 3 September 2019"," a melancholy comedy-drama from Amazon Studios: Vietnam vet Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Steve Carell) tracks down a pair of his old military friends: foul-mouthed and hard-drinking barkeep Sal (Bryan Cranston), and minister Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Doc asks his two friends to accompany him to pick up the remains of his son, a Marine killed in Iraq. The three men set out on an odyssey to have the young man buried and to perhaps put some old ghosts to rest themselves.This was based on the 2003 novel by Darryl Ponicsan, which was a sequel to his 1970 novel The Last Detail, which was memorably filmed in 1973 with Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid. Linklater, who co-wrote the script with Ponicsan, decided to alter this follow-up in several ways, changing the character names and a lot of their back story, but the essential dynamic is the same. I enjoyed this film well enough, but as a big fan of The Last Detail, I spent much of this movie's runtime comparing it, and wondering what might have been had this been filmed 15 years ago and with the original film's cast returning to their roles (Otis Young passed away in 2001, before the sequel novel was published). Seeing at least Nicholson and Quaid return in those roles would have been really something else.All that aside, this is still a largely enjoyable movie, with good performances and some nice, quiet character moments. The film seems to want to say something about veterans, and what they feel and how they deal with the rest of their lives, and how they end up viewing their country that they sacrificed for but who may have ultimately been lying to them. However, the script doesn't put these thoughts together in a clear enough fashion to be making any kind of definitive statement, but it may be the case that there really isn't one. It's odd to think that a movie set in 2003 is a period piece, but it is, and much is made of a visit by the three aging buddies to a cell phone store to check out the new-fangled technology. I'm curious how this movie will be viewed by actual Vietnam-era military veterans.~AlsExGal rated 7/10 on 25 December 2022"," A great ensemble piece with meaning: Last Flag Flying (2017) A great, low-key mixture of comedy and sadness. The more it went on the more I appreciated the situation, which unfolds like a play, and the ensemble acting, which is sharp. Bryan Cranston steals the show as the outgoing practical bartender veteran, but Laurence Fishburne and Steve Carell are really spot on, too, in deliberately restrained ways. The film is trying to get to something here. At first it seems to be about some guys coming to terms with their time in Viet Nam, and how it compromised them then, with repurcussions ever onward. Then a slow critique of war and of the US approach to war, pretending everyone in uniform is always a hero, and fighting for questionable (or worse) causes.  But an important third element grows-the actual meaning these men have for each other. They hadn't seen each other in decades, but their comraderie was almost unbroken because of some deep bond formed in wartime. And when it really comes down to it, even as they reject and hate the government for what they were forced to do, they still understood honor and respect. Including a love of country, somehow. That it's there, despite the flaws. Or something like that. (There are complications, and it would be easy and shameful to oversimplify.) The big point is: see this and give it time to settle in and warm up. The three men are deliberately an odd mix, and there are a couple of scenes that are rather too neatly contrived to make a fast point in the narrative, but overall it makes sense and is moving.~secondtake rated 8/10 on 1 August 2018"," A war film without the war: Richard Linklater on Last Flag Flying: 'We're not meant to kill. We're not cut out for it' I agree. This film hits the right tone, respectful to the men who have served this country, while also pointing out the futility of war. The ensemble cast is brilliant: Steve Carell does such a subtle job with a great deal of poignancy and what can you say about Bryan Cranston's burned out veteran who is constantly looking for a good time, while Laurence Fishburne is marvelous as a pastor. Such a wonderful film... another great film by Linklater.~rsg-25524 rated 10/10 on 6 February 2018"," A great tribute to our veterans!: 'LAST FLAG FLYING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Richard Linklater's new comedy-drama about three Vietnam war veterans who reunite, 30-years after serving together, when one of their sons is killed in the Iraq war. The film is based on the book (of the same name) by Darryl Ponicsan, which is a sequel to his 1970 novel 'The Last Detail' (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film). This movie stars Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne. Linklater also co-wrote the screenplay, with Ponicsan, and the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a really well made character study, that's also a great tribute to our veterans. The story is set in December of 2003, when former Navy corpsman Larry Shepherd (Carrell) is visiting the bar of an old marine he used to serve with, named Sal Nealon (Cranston). Larry reminds Sal who he is (and Sal only knew Larry by his nickname 'Doc'). He also reminds him that he was imprisoned, in a Navy prison, for a bad-conduct discharge, which (it's implied) Sal was somewhat responsible for. After the two get reacquainted, through a heavy night of drinking, they travel to the church of another Vietnam vet they used to serve with, named Richard Mueller (Fishburne). Larry then explains that his son was recently killed, while serving in Iraq, and he asks his two friends to accompany him to burry him. The three of course bond again while on their road trip together. You almost couldn't ask for three better, and more fitting, leads for this film! Carell, Cranston and Fishburne are all extremely likable, and relatable, and they also all have magical chemistry together. The movie is also brilliant in how it combines heart crushing drama, with surprisingly feel good humor. You never quite know how to feel while watching it, but it's always very believable and seemingly true to life (and I did get teary eyed multiple times). The movie doesn't feel like a typical Richard Linklater film, but he definitely still did an outstanding job directing and writing it, and I definitely still recommend it (for all).~Hellmant rated 9/10 on 1 February 2018"," Solid Performances, Great Script, Lots of Emotion.: When looking at the total body of work of writer/director/producer Richard Linklater, it would appear that this is a guy that relishes on throwing the movie going public constant curveballs. From the indie darling ""Slacker,"" (which people like Kevin Smith cite as a film that helped them become a filmmaker to begin with) to the ""Before"" trilogy with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, cult hits like ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""SubUrbia"" and the Oscar darling ""Boyhood,"" his diversity in storytelling is one that makes sure that can challenge both himself and the audience. When I found out that his latest venture was adapting and directing Darryl Poniscan's novel (which Poniscan also helped with the screenplay) ""Last Flag Flying,"" I was definitely intrigued by yet another left turn for Linklater.In this film set near the end of 2003, Steve Carell plays Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd, who shows up at the bar owned by Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) after not seeing each other for almost thirty years since they served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam together. With shared experiences that they are not sure they want to talk about, they seek out their third running buddy from those days in Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne), who is now a reverend in a small church. As they are all catching up with each other, Shepherd drops on them his reason for getting together: his son (a Marine himself) has been killed overseas, and he wants Mueller and Nealon to come with him to not only help bury him but along the way heal themselves and each other.This film was a pleasant surprise for me. The vibe that I got from the one sheet and reading about it was one where I thought would venture into darkness and politics quickly and for the duration of the two hours that it would be on the screen. While there is not much more than a smattering of preachiness here, it is Poniscan's story of these three characters that is relied on to keep things moving, as it should be. These three actors are such powerhouses in their own rights that their work together makes this story even more powerful and even fun. There are some great comedic moments, driven mostly by Cranston's character, that keep the balance of ""Last Flag Flying"" in perfect harmony with its drama and emotion.There is also a ""name to watch"" here in J. Quinton Johnson. Mainly known for being one of the victims of the horrid ""Dirty Dancing"" experiment earlier this year, don't let that fool you. This young man, as the best friend of Shepherd's son who was there with him when he passed, shows amazing emotional range and compassion that shines through even as he shares the frame with some of the biggest actors of the last three decades. His performance is truly impressive, and I look for much bigger things for him in the future.Amazon Studios continues to gain steam with their cinematic choices, and along with Lionsgate, they have another winner with ""Last Flag Flying"". Releasing over Veterans' Day weekend, this is a very respectful and engaging telling of a tale of our service men and women both current and former that runs the gambit of emotion and is truly a great way to spend a couple of hours in any form.~Obi_Bamm_Karaoke rated 8/10 on 9 November 2017"," Another Great Linklater Script: I'll come right out and state the fact that I'm a huge fan of Richard Linklater. The way he writes and directs his performers mesmerizes me. By those standards, I feel that he's still one of the best in the business working today. From Before Sunrise, to Dazed and Confused, to even his recent works in Boyhood and Everybody Wants Some!!, I find myself liking his body of work more and more. So, please take this review with a grain of salt, but I truly feel that his latest film, Last Flag Flying, is easily one of the best movies to come out in 2017 and also one of the most underrated. This film has slipped pretty far under the radar, and that upsets me because this is just about the most sincere and honest piece of filmmaking to come from last year.Based on a true story, Last Flag Flying follows Richard (Steve Carell), a former United States Marine who is informed that his son (who's also in the Marines) has been killed in combat. Seeking the help of his old friends in Sal and Mueller from decades ago, they embark on a quest to bring Richard's son's body home, as he doesn't want him buried with the rest of his crew. This is literally the only major plot that's followed throughout the film, but there's so much going on under the surface for each character that I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It never hurts when you have a director that knows exactly how to work with actors and ends up getting lucky with some of the most talented actors in these roles.Linklater's films have always been about the characters first and foremost. If you don't buy into any of the characters, then it's highly unlikely that you'll end up enjoying the movie. That being said, each one of these characters is distinctly different, but Carell, Cranston, and Fishburne all do their utmost to truly embody these figures. Once again, I found myself invested in each and every scene, being moved along by the terrifically written dialogue from start to finish. The conversations between characters feel so natural, and that all comes back (once again) to writer/director Richard Linklater.His unique/natural writing always leaps off the screen and his directing isn't too shabby either, but I feel the true star of this film is the story itself. It really makes you take a step back and appreciate what you had in the past because the future isn't always sunshine and rainbows. Even through dark times, there's always light to brighten up certain situations. The final act of this film left me in tears, due to the fact that I had no clue who any of these characters were in the beginning, and found myself attached to whatever they were going to say next by the end.In the end, although very slow-moving, the dialogue moves Last Flag Flying along at a very brisk pace. This two-hour picture feels about 90 minutes long in my opinion and if you're into hard-hitting dramas, then I'd have to recommend looking no further than this. An older demographic will definitely get more out of this film than the millennials of today, but that's not to say that everyone can't enjoy this movie. Meticulously directed in terms of character, wonderfully written in terms of dialogue, and impeccably executed in terms of bringing the audience from point A to point B throughout long periods of time, this is a road trip movie that will have you laughing out loud and weeping all at once. I can't recommend Last Flag Flying enough.~kjproulx rated 10/10 on 29 January 2018"," A film of reflection, memories, and bonding of friendship thru struggles and emotions.: Finally watched the latest film from Richard Linklater who mostly does works of friendship and family and with this touching drama ""Last Flag Flying"" it doesn't let you down. A film that's powerful and bold with a statement of courage showing that honor can be done in a different way and manner.Set in 2003 thirty years after a trio of Vietnam War veterans served all reunite and get together on a different mission and that's the burial of one's son former Navy Corp medic Larry ""The Doc""(Steve Carell), as Doc's son was a young Marine killed in the Iraq war.Yet this burial is different Doc decides instead of a National Cemetery burial the casket will go back by train to his New Hampshire hometown. Along the way help and support is given from the outspoken and against the grain Sal(Bryan Cranston) and the straight and loving Rev. Richard(Laurence Fishburne).Along the way this journey produces memories, reflection, and rediscovered love and thru it all these traits continue to shape their lives with bravery and courage. Overall this is a well done film of standing up and being brave with courage and emotion.~blanbrn rated 9/10 on 5 July 2018"," Great acting and writing carries this movie: Greetings from Lithuania.""Last Flag Flying"" (2017) has to say something about war and politics. It does not like either of them. What i did like about this movie was not its message, perhaps, but acting and writing. On its core its a 2 hours road movie with some war veterans who share some dark secret. There are no revelations at the end of they journey, but there is some sort of accomplishment of what they did on the road.Overall, while ""Last Flag Flying"" isn't as good as Richard Linklater's previous movies (far from it), i did enjoy this picture entirely because of veteran actors doing good job and reading fine lines. This is a very anti-war movie without a war and a solid road drama.~851222 rated 8/10 on 7 July 2018"," A hilariously profound film with three great lead performances.: Last Flag Flying is a comedy/drama from the acclaimed director of Boyhood and Dazed and Confused, Richard Linklater. It stars Steve Carell, Laurence Fishburne, and Bryan Cranston as three friends from the Vietnam War who get back together when Carell's son dies in action. Despite the serious subject matter, this movie is absolutely hilarious. Cranston is absolute comedic gold. He hasn't been as funny as he is here since his Malcolm in the Middle days, and even then he may not have been quite as funny as he is here.You would think going in that Carell would be the comedian here, but instead he is the dramatic anchor. Carell gives a surprisingly emotional performance, keeping the comedy to a minimum. Fishburne is between the two, giving both comedy and drama when it's needed. Of the three it is hard to say which gives the best performance, but the edge must go to Cranston. The movie would probably be ten times more boring without him. There are scenes where Cranston single-handedly made the entire audience in my theater howl with laughter. Last Flag Flying doesn't just give comedy however, it also tackles a great amount of issues that a lesser film would not have pulled off. This film explores the purpose of life, a subject that Linklater is very good at tackling. I would list some of the other issues it tackles, but if I did i would probably be here all day. This movie is definitely not perfect. Near the middle it starts to drag, which is not that large of an issue, but for one or two scenes it is noticeable.There is also a very manufactured conflict in the film. It feels like the writers stuck it in just so there was a conflict of some sort, but it easily could have been taken out and the movie would not have changed. Another issue involves tone. There are a couple scenes where I genuinely could not tell if the film was trying to be serious or funny, but this, like all of the other flaws, is not that big of a deal. Overall, I recommend Last Flag Flying because of both its hilarity and its drama. It is one of the funniest movie of the year and very profound, despite its flaws. I give Last Flag Flying a B+.~FallonTimberlake2016 rated 8/10 on 24 October 2017"
The Great Escape (1963) - IMDb,8.2,Steve McQueen|James Garner|Richard Attenborough|Charles Bronson|James Donald|Donald Pleasence|James Coburn|Hannes Messemer|David McCallum|Gordon Jackson|John Leyton|Angus Lennie|Nigel Stock|Robert Graf|Jud Taylor|Hans Reiser|Harry Riebauer|William Russell,John Sturges,Paul Brickhill|James Clavell|W.R. Burnett,Allied prisoners of war plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a German camp during World War II.," ""We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely."": The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 17 September 2006"," If you're going to critique the history, then know the history.: I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.~FABabe rated NA on 31 January 2003"," The Great Movie: The Germans, ""with madness in their method"" have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts to escape and put them in a POW camp which they have devised to be inescapable. Under the supervision of Richard Attenborough, they immediately begin to dig tunnels to break out 250 men.There are anhistorical elements here. There were four tunnels dug, not the three in the movie; the date of the escape was changed; most notably, several American flyers took part in the breakout. While Americans did take part in the planning and construction, they had been moved to a different camp by the time of the event. This was an American film, and director John Sturges had been trying to get this project off the ground for the better part of a decade before he and the Mirisches got United Artists to foot the bill, so James Garner, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson (as a Pole) got major roles. UA also wanted a shorter running time, and some women, which Sturges was able to resist.It's a great, gripping blend of suspense and thrills, with some pawky humor thrown in, and a canny shift in camerawork. The first two-thirds, with its closed-in spaces sustains an element of oppression, culminating with the breakout, at night in the confined space of the tunnel. This is followed by brightly lit and open vistas as the escapees make their ways towards freedom. Because Sturges had directed THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the remake of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I thought for many years this dichotomy was taken from Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW. However, the latter picture was released four months after Sturges'.170 minutes is a very long time for a feature film, and this was undoubtedly released in a road show version with an intermission. The natural place for a break would be right after the Germans discover the primary tunnel. Nowadays, when I watch this, I can take a break whenever I like. Even knowing how it comes out, it's a struggle to stop the movie at any point.~boblipton rated 10/10 on 13 January 2022"," Not just great, simply magnificent more like!: ""Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10~hitchcockthelegend rated 10/10 on 4 March 2008"," Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...: I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.~planktonrules rated 9/10 on 27 December 2011"," A vast, multi-star war epic with great score by Elmer Bernstein...: 'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source, and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner, giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half, allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor, excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended, and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers, mostly pilots, being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant', Von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald), 'We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps, Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X,' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture, and plans to strike back, getting as many men as possible out of the camp, in order to 'harass, confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry... The plan, so precise, proceeds in an orderly fashion, with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity, which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn), the 'Cooler King,' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner), the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger', and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence,' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German ""Ferrets."" Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole,' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps, repeated failed escape attempts, and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious, and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation... It graphically shows what enterprising men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances... It has a great cast, and is beautifully made...~Nazi_Fighter_David rated 9/10 on 18 July 2001"," Behind the Wire: Exactly fifty years ago this month I first saw this on BBC1 with the never to be repeated news that it was ""the first ever screening on British television"".The fact that it's deservedly become a classic obscures the fact that (SPOILER COMING:) director John Sturges was adamant about retaining the ending of John Brickhill's 1956 bestseller, which for several years made it an impossible pitch until he enjoyed a huge hit with 'The Magnificent Seven' and was finally able to interest the money men by reuniting three of The Seven.To keep costs down it was shot in Europe, and the authentic German locations - and the largely British supporting cast - simply made the result even more distinctive.~richardchatten rated 10/10 on 31 December 2021"," We Choose the Cooler: Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein  to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100.~tedg rated NA on 23 February 2001"," Fantastic Movie: They will never make movies like this again...

The vets who don't like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.After seeing it in a very high quality theater on its initial release, I walked out thinking it was easily one of the best movies I had ever seen - and that I never wanted to see it again. But I looked at it today on cable and found that not much had changed about it, or me. I don't want to see it again...but I want you to see it.Even now, the Russian Roulette scene (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I've seen; it makes the end of ""Reservoir Dogs"" seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting. A unique classic...it is not surprising that Cimino didn't have another movie in him after something this wrenching.~yawn-2 rated 10/10 on 6 April 2006"," It's been given a fairly bad reputation over the years - undeservedly so, too. One of the greatest films ever made.: ""One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot.""There's that particularly infamous scene in ""The Deer Hunter"" that seems to remain more disturbing each time we view it, when Michael (Robert De Niro), a Vietnam veteran, tracks down a friend of his named Nicky (Christopher Walken), who never arrived home after the war and is eventually found in Saigon, playing Russian Roulette for money, his mind an utter mess. He is unable to fully remember Michael, and refuses to return home, and what proceeds in the following sequence is a haunting example of gut-wrenching film-making.The Vietnam sequences take place midway through the movie, serving as a connection between the beginning and the end, both of which study the lives of the men and not the war around them. Michael, Nicky and Steven (John Savage) are young Pennsylvanian miners drafted into the war. Steven has just gotten married to the love of his life, but has little time to celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends. They eventually all find themselves taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where their captors force them to play Russian Roulette. The rules of the game? Put a single bullet in a random chamber of a handgun, spin it, snap it, raise it to your head, squeeze the trigger, and repeat these steps until there's only one man left standing.After a series of fortunate events Michael, Nicky and Steven escape and make their way downriver. All three men are eventually rescued, Nicky via helicopter and Michael and Steven later on. Steven's battered, infected legs are amputated and he is left helpless in a wheelchair. Michael returns home as well only to find that Nicky is still back in Vietnam. Nicky's girlfriend back home, Linda (Meryl Street), begins to fall in love with Michael, but Michael soon remembers his promise to Nicky (""If I don't make it back don't leave me over there"") and travels over 2,000 miles back into the middle of his own personal hell to find and rescue his best friend. It's hard for him to understand why Nicky doesn't recognize him when he finally tracks him down. ""It's me, Mike."" ""Mike who?""Causing mass controversy upon its release because of its alleged ""racist"" content regarding the Vietnamese, a crowd of Vietnam veterans gathered around outside the Oscars ceremony and caused riots as well, claiming that the film was ""not accurate"" and somehow insulting to the veterans of the war. However as many film historians, authors and critics have already pointed out, the film is never meant to be a 100% accurate depiction of the events in Vietnam. It is not really a Vietnam War picture at all. Instead, it is a focus on the aftermath of war, and how damaging it can be, both physically and mentally, to its participants. Because of the era that ""The Deer Hunter"" was released in, Vietnam was a recent event, the focus of the nation, and is therefore used as a more convenient -- and relative -- backdrop (much like ""Apocalypse Now""). Unlike ""Platoon"" this is not a movie relating specifically to the Vietnam War, in fact less than a half an hour is devoted to the war scenes. It is a character study, and accusations of racism -- although perhaps justified to some extent -- are hardly convincing as the film itself is not concerned with bashing the participants of the war as it is the war itself.It is the film's necessary setup that is often called long and boring and, ironically, unnecessary, but this is essentially where the nature of each character is examined for the audience. To launch directly into the war sequences would be sloppy, and we would have a harder time caring for the characters. Instead, we are given scenes with weddings, discussions, and hunting trips -- normal events. Then, the end, a somber reflection upon the past, chronicles the aftermath of the damaging events in the lives of Michael, Steven, Nicky and their loved ones. Michael has a hard time adapting back to his normal life. It would be hard for anyone, after experiencing such damaging events and images. De Niro made a few post-Vietnam films during the '70s and '80s, the most famous being ""Taxi Driver,"" in which Travis Bickle was totally unable to find his way in life again after the war and resorted to violence in order to justify his existence and release his anger. ""The Deer Hunter"" is similar in approach but reveals more background; this would be a suitable prequel of sorts if the names had been changed.Over the years ""The Deer Hunter"" has surprisingly gained a fairly bad reputation -- most of which stems back to the controversy surroundings its release and protested accolades. Director Michael Cimino's follow-up (""Heaven's Gate"") was an enormous flop, bankrupting United Artists, and he had a hard time finding work afterwards. His first feature film, ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" which starred Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges, was a buddy road movie that was also a sign of things to come in Cimino' later features, most notably the process of male bonding, which is a huge primal element in this project. Cimino was an extremely talented and visionary director, and it's a shame that the ambition of ""Heaven's Gate"" cost him his career.And furthermore, despite the negativity surrounding ""The Deer Hunter,"" it is still one of the finest works of American cinema, a touching, poignant and ultimately depressing film that asks us if the effects of war extend past the physical and into the realm of human mentality. Yes, I think they do.~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 7 July 2004"," One Shot: I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother's family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He's growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he's in and can't bring himself to come home.Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she's so totally immersed in her role and her role's ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven's Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino's career plummeted and never really got back on track.28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn't really about the Vietnam War. It's about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.And this review is dedicated to those that serve.~bkoganbing rated 9/10 on 12 December 2007"," A War Like All Wars A Film Like No Other: ""The Deer Hunter"" is 32 years old. How extraordinary to sit through it now. Walking over the politics that divided , somehow, all of its admirers then. ""Great film but..."" How silly to think of it now. Michael (a sensational young Robert De Niro) is as extreme a character as Rocco was in ""Rocco And His Brothers"" His goodness, the one that was always there but that he discovers under the most horrendous circumstances, underlined by Stanley Mayers's ""Cavatina"" permeates the entire film. I remember thinking, when I saw the film for the first time, that I couldn't or wouldn't spend ten minutes with Michael and his friends, the ones we meet at the beginning of the film but by the end I thought of them as brothers and I loved them. I actually loved them. That in itself is a sort of film miracle. John Savage will break your heart, it certainly broke mine and Christopher Walken is absolutely riveting. How strange to tho think that Michael Cimino, still a young man, is nowhere to be seen. Is still a punishment for ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Indecent Exposure"" or there is something else we don't know about. The Cimino behind ""The Deer Hunter"" is a true master.~abelardo64 rated 10/10 on 31 January 2010"," Hard to Watch At Times!: 1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However, there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of ""God Bless America."" I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later, I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD (post-trauma syndrome). But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best, but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.You can call this movie a symphony of some sort. I sort this film into three major segments. The first segment is the longest because of its lengthy and effective characterization. We meet three Pennsylvania factory workers: Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (Christopher Walken). They enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam. Steven decides to marry before going off to war and this wedding also serves as the farewell party. This section is eerily reminiscent of the opening act of The Godfather. There is lots of partying and dancing. And we essentially get to know these characters. These men are hard workers who get drunk at the party because they deserve a night for themselves. After the party, the trio of friends along with another friend Stan (John Cazale) go into the mountains to hunt for deer for one last trip. Hence the title of the movie. I found this section to be incredibly effective in character-building. Director Michael Cimino took his time with his part because it was important to understand these men before they go into the horrors of war.The second movement of our symphony is the actual war. Just like that with a loud noise, the film instantly changes its tone. From the foggy mountains of Pennsylvania to the tropical war zone of Vietnam we go. In one of the most terrifying sequences ever made, the three men are taken prisoner and are forced to play Russian roulette while their captors are betting who will win and who will die. Just seeing the men's faces as they are waiting their turn in the rat-infested cages are undeniably scary. One of the film's controversies is that roulette was not actually played in Vietnam. According to Cimino, he read articles saying they did play roulette although any of this has not been confirmed. But it's one hell of a way to add tension to the movie. You can also take this as a symbol for the war overall. Roger Ebert puts it perfectly in his review, ""Anything you can believe about the game, about it's deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply it to the war as a whole."" Essentially, this violence stands for the war itself and what these men face. Now our final act of the symphony is what happens after the horrors of the prison camp. Michael becomes a prominent character here as he returns home and is welcomed as a hero by his townsfolk and his girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). But Michael does not feel like a hero. Steven is in the hospital after losing his legs and Nick is somewhere in Vietnam still. Michael eventually goes back to find Nick who happened to take his roulette experiences to heart by playing this game professionally. This section is incredibly sad and moving as here we see what exactly war can do to strong-willed men. It was horrible to watch this transformation on screen. To see these characters we got to laugh with in the first part to seeing them play with death in the final act is sad to see. We also get to see an act of patriotism (or is it?) when the survivors join in a ragged rendition of ""God Bless America"" in the very end. This movie has a very strong cast, although the only star at the time was Robert De Niro. De Niro instantly became the film's leader and he played Michael very well. He became a bona fide star after his work in The Godfather: Part Two, and he put that stardom to work here. Christopher Walken had some of the strongest scenes in the movie because of his involvement with the deadly game of Russian roulette. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses ever to grace our screens, and this was one of her first big roles. We end this paragraph with a sad note. This would be the last movie John Cazale would play because he was suffering from terminal cancer and he died before the film was released. He was very good as Stan, but you can tell in the movie that he was really sick.Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a incredible movie about the horror of wars and it effective covers themes ranging from PTSD to male bonding and friendship. It was one of the first movies to successfully cover the Vietnam War, although I'd say this film may not be the most accurate regarding the actual war. I do commend its effort on conveying the themes of general war though. This film was nominated for nine Oscars and it won five of them including Best Picture. Walken took home the statue for his amazing and tense performance as Nick. The film may be controversial and it may be hard to watch, but it's one you'll remember forever. My Grade: A-~gab-14712 rated 9/10 on 18 October 2017"," A veteran's impression of ""The Deer Hunter"": I will not repeat much of the comments in the previous positive reviews, but will stick mostly to how the movie affected me. First off, I am an Army veteran of the Vietnam War. Thus there is much in this picture that deeply moves me. I still can not listen to the theme music piece played by John Williams, ""Cavatina"", without choking up and weeping.I identify much with the characters in this movie. I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class ( Norwegian, Scots-Irish, English) background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one's country in the military. Both my brother, two cousins and my future brother-in-law also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael, played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to 'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is, as mentioned in the movie ""Rob Roy"", a gift a man gives to himself. Michael (and the movie) doesn't waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you're sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or anti-Vietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character, honor, loyalty------what you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected (albeit weakly) in me.In closing, I can not help to remember that the politically anti-Vietnam War movie ""Coming home"" starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year, she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn't ""The Deer Hunter"". In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically, Jane Fonda has never apologized for her pro-Viet Cong actions. At the age of 66, I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.~ldadvantageinc rated 10/10 on 22 August 2012"," Goodness. So Heartbreaking, So Sad, So Accurate, So Brilliant.: Outstanding and haunting Best Picture winner of 1978 that still packs a punch nearly 25 years later. Robert DeNiro (Oscar-nominated), Christopher Walken (Oscar-winning for Best Supporting Actor) and John Savage are on their way to fight for their country in Vietnam. The three are in for a rude awakening from their simple lives in a small steel town in Pennsylvania. The terrors of Vietnam will change all. DeNiro, an avid deer hunter, cannot stand to even shoot a gun after he returns. Savage loses his legs and is too ashamed and scared to return home to his new wife and friends. Walken has lost it mentally and stays in Vietnam and develops the taste for Russian roulette. The movie is a trial to sit through in many ways, but it is also an important film that was the first commentary on the topic of Vietnam. Meryl Streep also received her first of a record 12 Oscar nominations as Walken's love interest. John Cazale was deathly ill during the making of the movie and died shortly after the film was completed of terminal cancer. Michael Cimino's amazing Oscar-nominated screenplay and out-of-this-world Oscar-winning direction are right on key. ""The Deer Hunter"" is important film-making that has a strong message about life, death and love. It is a movie that should be experienced by everyone at least once. 5 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 15 March 2002"," The Deer Hunter: 10/10: Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just  the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle, but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter, which got him  to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor, he always picks  good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you  can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.  Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage)  sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding  party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the  midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and  eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences  from the war.  It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his  direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film  together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that  has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know  these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if  they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by  these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel  enough for these three basic people to get through the war.  The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete  stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension  on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make  sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known  these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to  die, making them all the more nervous.  The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal  Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed  the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped  make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the  three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for  the better.  De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately  takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he  won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting  character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting,  it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know  how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this  tour-de-force.  My rating: 10/10  Rated R for strong language and violence.~movieguy1021 rated 10/10 on 18 January 2004"," Devastating at the time, uneven and problematic now: I hadn't seen this movie since it came out 43 years ago, at which point it seemed overwhelming--not perfect, just overwhelming in its scope and intensity. Of course, I was only 17 then, most of the actors were very new to audiences, and much of the content seemed groundbreaking as well as shocking. Seeing it all this time later, inevitably the credibility of the leads as ""ordinary steeltown folk"" would be a bit overshadowed by their familiarity from subsequent decades of stardom. Plus we've had lots of films about the Vietnam War since, and of course the violence is no longer very shocking.But ""The Deer Hunter"" has other problems now--problems it always had, I guess, but which weren't so apparent at the time. The screenplay has scope, yes, but the storytelling just kind of lurches from one incident to another with little connective thread, transitional material or real character development, and the dialogue often sounds improvised, as in kinda-feeble. (Cimino is on the record as saying he told Streep she could improvise dialogue, because in the script her character was basically a complete blank.) There are huge setpieces yet almost no transitions between them,The whole ""Russian Roulette"" thing is problematic not just because it's a gross distortion historically, but because even as a fictive leap of the imagination, it fails-first it's just part of the movie's one-note portrayal of the Viet Cong as monsters, then it's a ludicrous underground civilian pastime that one character even more ludicrously makes his ""living"" at. (Really? That would go on for months? Years? How long can anyone's luck hold out?) The hunting sequences meant to lend some mythic dimension here are just heavy-handed and absurdly action-packed; did no one tell Cimino that 99% of such hunting is patient waiting? The scenes meant to be ""everyday life""--notably that long, busy wedding party--are so overstuffed with forced joie de vivre and actorish ""business,"" they now feel more mannered than ""natural."" (And yes, that definitely applies to the always-controversial ""God Bless America,"" which the movie no longer has enough emotional potency to pass off as cathartic rather than a dramatic limb that shouldn't have been gone out on. I'm not a big fan of John Williams' often syrupy score, either--this film needs something edgier.) It's a bit sad that this is John Cazale's last movie, because his typical problem-causing-weakling character is almost completely extraneous here--he only gets in the way, to a degree where one wonders why any of other figures tolerate him.It's an alternately pretentious and broad movie that nonetheless is visually very well-crafted and has some powerful scenes. It's a pity this director didn't have a slower rise to the top, because winning Best Picture etc. Clearly made him oblivious to his shortcomings (mostly in the realm of storytelling), which became catastrophically clear when he was given free rein with ""Heaven's Gate."" If that movie seems to have been considerably underrated, ""The Deer Hunter"" now looks greatly overrated. They're both impressively scaled, problematic, great-looking, mixed-bag films by a talented director who needed to be kept on a much shorter leash to maximize his strengths and minimize his self-indulgences, and who proved his own worst enemy in recovering from such a drastic reversal of fortunes.""The Deer Hunter"" remains an interesting film, very effective in individual elements if awfully disjointed as a whole. But it certainly would look a lot better now if it hadn't been greeted as a ""masterpiece"" in the first place. It can no longer live up to a reputation it may never have deserved, but which made sense in the cultural moment of its initial release. What impresses now is film's messy ambitiousness, not so much what it actually achieves. In that latter department, you'd have to say that the best movie Cimino ever made remains his first (and smallest), ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.""~ofumalow rated 6/10 on 25 April 2021"," It's about character development: A comment re the other comments: A lot of the comments criticize the first half hour as being too long. In my opinion, these comments miss the point of the movie.Of course many of the scenes in the first hour don't advance the narrative. They're not supposed to; they're for character development.The whole point of the movie is to show us how the various characters were affected by the war. It wouldn't have worked nearly as powerfully as it does had the first hour been trimmed down. We have to sense the careless and frat-boy-like immaturity of these young men. That's why the scenes all revolve around frivolity and seemingly senseless boyish behavior; it creates such a stark contrast to the devastated characters of the three who went to war (and the relatively unaffected personalities of those who stayed behind, like Stanley).The strong points of the film are the outstanding performances of nearly every actor in the movie. Yes, there are technical deficiencies in the sound, but it hardly matters. This is nitpicking compared to the overall construction of the film.~mikeand1-1 rated 10/10 on 21 May 2005"

We have Tarantino-inspired bloody action, silent and very charismatic protagonist, beautiful imaginery from actual locations in Lapland, really good soundtrack and some innovative fighting and survival scenes, and of course Finnish Sisu.Jorma Tommila as the leading man does a phenomenal job. He has only one line in the whole movie (an instant classic), but he is acting very well just by using his face and body.""He is not immortal, he just refuses to die.""Congratulations for the writer/director Jalmari Helander, the movie looks really good, flows forward easily and is overall very cool and original, despite the overused tropes of evil nazis and action. With just 6 million budget this looks much bigger.Some nitpicks: the nazis speak English, even when talking with each other, which is kind of weird. But it makes sense for scenes with some Finns.I really hope this gets much views all over the world.Don't take the movie or events too seriously, just enjoy the ride :)~rioksane-02950 rated NA on 30 January 2023"," They want to steal mi gold! But I'm an inglorious (and indestructible) Sisu from Finland!: There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet! Especially when watching in a chock-full festival theater with a thousand of outrageous horror fanatics shouting at a screen. Must-see!~Coventry rated 8/10 on 18 April 2023"," Pretty good: Heard this movie was an awesome old school action movie so checked it out, and it is good. Even if it is very over the top.On the plus side the movie gives the audience what its been starved off. Brutal, adult action with minimal CGI. And with plenty of lines like ""we're lucky he didn't kill more of us"" it'll put a smile on your face if you miss 80's/90's style action.On the negative side all the bad guys are terrible shots, and the hero is almost indestructible. Which maybe takes a bit of suspence out of the movie. Especially at the end. Much like modern superhero movies then? At least it got it half right.~martinrobertson300482 rated 7/10 on 30 May 2023"," Sisu. A Man of Few Words Seeks a Life of Peace After The Hell of War.: Finland. Such a gorgeous landscape even when war torn. It's 1944 and a rogue commander now wanders the Laplands looking for gold, oh, that precious and sweet yellow metal. The Second World War is rumbling to a noisy end, and still a reminder that it's there off in the not so far distance and occasionally it's even closer in the air overhead.This elder and his really cool-looking dog (I want one!) search this ravaged world, just the two of them and a horse as well. Panning for riches.This is a silent film for the first half hour or so, but where conversation may lack, the beauty of everything else on screen fills in those gaps rather nicely. (You'll think as you watch, I want to visit Finland. I want to live in Finland.)But this is the mid-1940's and there are Nazis being pushed out of the country at the moment and they are losing this war and their death-grip on this land and its' people.This movie is told in six announced chapters. It's a gloriously short hour and a half. Tarantino's influence is heavy but more so from his Westerns than from Inglorious Basterds as one might think.The kills are awesome. The fights are realistic and not like the choreographed dance fighting we see in most modern productions these days.Though there is little dialogue as stated, it is told here in English and there are no subtitles.The action sequences are breathtaking and hearten back to Raiders of the Lost Ark.I'm serious!This is a good story and it is timeless.A man and his dog want to live comfortably, in peace, and be left alone.This is one of the Best Films of 2023.This is one of the Best Films of the 2020s.~RightOnDaddio rated 9/10 on 28 April 2023"," Over The Top Cult Hit: I saw Sisu, starring Jorma Tommila-Man and a Junior, Big Game; Aksel Hennie-The Cloverfield Paradox, The Martian; Jack Doolan-The Boys_tv, Cemetery Junction and Mimosa Willamo-Aurora, Headfirst.Most people that I have talked to have not even heard of this movie. Luckily, I saw a trailer for it about a month ago. The word Siso is a Finnish word that roughly translates into: Courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. Jorma plays the man that has plenty of Sisu. He is a former soldier that is now a prospector, looking for-and finding-gold in northern Finland in 1944. WW2 is ending and the Nazis are retreating. Aksel is an SS officer leading his men in a retreat using a scorched earth policy of burning villages and capturing girls as souvenirs-he has about 6 so far. Jack is Aksel's next in command and Mimosa is one of the captured girls. Jorma crosses paths with Aksel and things get out of control fast. Aksel wants Jorma's gold as a retirement fund from Germany-since the war is now ending-and Jorma doesn't want to give it up. The rest is over the top action with plenty of body parts flying through the air. There is even a scene where a a Nazi soldier asks if maybe Jorma is immortal-they keep trying unsuccessfully to kill him-and Mimosa tells him, No he just refuses to die! I can see this movie becoming a cult favorite.It's rated R for bloody violence, gore and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes.I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu_Ray.~stevendbeard rated 8/10 on 28 April 2023"," Yes, this is sisu: Sisu is a complicated concept. In a way it is pure stoic perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, but it is important to note that it is not just determination. It is also cleverness, that manifests itself when you most need it. Sisu is finding the solution to a problem, no matter what. This movie is definitely about that. Aatami, our ""hero"", finds the way.Being old enough Finn to have known many people of this generation, this isn't even that much of an embellishment.The movie is quite simplistic. The Finnish characters don't even talk until very late into the movie (which is actually another insight into Finnish culture). You have a goldminer with gold and a company of Nazis hunting him. You can't really go wrong with this storywise. You just have to make the characters and the action interesting enough. Do they? Yes. This might me kind of mild in the age of superhero movies and the more traditional action movies copying the superhero movies, but it works. In some ways kind of refreshing to keep it all more grounded.While this might be more meaningful to me as a Finn, I would assume that if you enjoy mid-budget action, this will be right up your alley (although, at 6 million euros, the budget was much lower than what would be considered midlevel in bigger markets).~h79423 rated 8/10 on 27 January 2023"," A load of unbelievable rubbish!: First off, let me say that the cinematography in this movie is sick. The effects were amazing. It's bloody, it's unapologetically violent. But unfortunately that's all there is to it.If you want to enjoy this movie, switch off your brains because it will insult your intelligence. The problem with such movies is that, even though it's a fictional story, they paint a picture of realness but fail to develop actual real scenarios.The reason why movies like James Bond, Equalizer, Borne, Mission Impossible and even John Wick, to an extent, work, is because the directors created scenes which where very much believable. This movie was unbelievable from the very beginning.All the three soldiers had to do was point and shoot which they didn't do. I don't know why they chose to fight instead. Then you had the landmine scene which was laughable. How does a horse get blow up and the rider, not a scratch? Then you have several soldiers firing randomly in one direction and they completely missed you and you didn't step on any landmine? Then you had the sniper who misses every single shot and even when using the heavy gun, he seem to get the dead guy being carried by the man, but when the dead guy is dropped, he can't get the guy himself? And you mean to tell me that the guys walking behind the trucks, couldn't see him rolling on the floor? They didn't see him kill the soldiers, enter the truck and hand over guns to the women? If there's gasoline, you check the gas tanks, no? And when they finally caught him, they hung him? Someone who could hold his breath under water for hours?! You decide not to shoot him?! And theeeeeeeennnn when you thought it couldn't get worse, he hits a MOVING plane with an axe, held onto it for it for a lift off and still managed to release the axe, pierce an armored plane with it whilst in mid air, enters the plane in time before the villain could get to him. And when the villain finally got to him and beat him to a pulp, he forgot he has a gun he can use to kill him, but rather, chose to use a rope?! Absolutely Ridiculous. And the last insult was when the plane crashes headfirst, minutes later man gets out holding his axe, unhurt, unscratched, eyes still white as snow, he rides to the bank with his gold and demands for cash.NONSENSE!~therealjaysmoke rated 5/10 on 21 May 2023"," 6.7/10.

And it's shallow, everything here is shallow and naive.But it was entertaining. Ok, suspension of disbelief is fully required in order to enjoy it. And you will enjoy it if you like this genre.

In conclusion, it's always nice watching bad guys get slaughtered!~athanasiosze rated 7/10 on 26 July 2023"," Determination in the face of overwhelming odds: A lone prospector, Sisu, returning from the wilderness with bags full of gold encounters a detachment of Nazi soldiers who decide to take the gold for themselves. Sisu is no mere person however, but the human embodiment of mythic Finnish determination in the face of overwhelming odds. ""Koshi"" is the name that Russian soldiers gave to him, which means ""immortal."" In other words, Sisu is a one-man death squad. The Germans are told to let the man be and that they are lucky to be alive, but they laugh and ignore the warnings. What follows are battles on land, in mine fields, above the clouds, and under water, between devastating force and a sole, determined, and mysteriously powerful individual who stubbornly refuses to give up.Indiscriminate killings and other violence dominate this irreverent, bloody, and enticing film. While I wish the dialogue and other aspects of the film were better, I loved the thrilling action and the explosive and cathartic retelling of this Finnish legend. Director Jalmari Helander of Rare Exports and Big Game fame, was present along with some of the main actors for this Toronto International Film Festival, midnight madness, and world premiere screening. After a three-hour plane delay in New York I arrived at the last minute to the packed Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto and the refreshing roar and hilarious jeers of the midnight madness crowd. It was so much fun.~Blue-Grotto rated 7/10 on 2 October 2022"," Don't get me wrong, I love my meat, but without the potatoes, it's not really a full meal.: Sure, it was ridonculous and fun, but this could've easily been so much better had the filmmaker spent less time with the repetitive logic-defying suspension of disbelief with the outrageous confrontations and deadly fight scenes, and focused more on a singular theme and tone for the dramatics, with expanding on the narrative - instead of plugging in pointless chapters. You can take only so much nonsense before you start thinking if this is a war parody film. A little more dialogue and character building would've also gone a long way. Even at a mere 91 min runtime and the decent pacing, there was barely a story here to make a short film, let alone 91 mins. At least the cinematography, S/VFX and gore were top-notch though. Nevertheless, an entertaining popcorn actioneer.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 7/10 on 17 May 2023"

He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.~keving4241 rated 10/10 on 11 October 2018"," ""Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. Our world has taken a turn for the surreal"".: I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time.~classicsoncall rated 10/10 on 27 August 2011"," A war film you simply can't miss.: Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 23 February 2020"," War is hell, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" peeks into the gates of Hades: I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What ""Saving Private Ryan"" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.~ToldYaSo rated 9/10 on 16 August 1999"," Everything you've heard is true: I've long been a fan of war films but for some reason it took me eight years to finally get around to watch this, the often undisputed classic war film of all time. Why? Not sure really ‚Äì I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible ‚Äì widescreen DVD, 52"" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.At the heart, the film recalls dozens of other war films from THE DIRTY DOZEN to THE LONGEST DAY. A squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission, facing almost certain depth. Where the movie excels, however, is in the extra depth and layers that Spielberg adds. The characterisation is strong, the dialogue harsh and heartfelt. Technically, the film is perfect. The colours are faded and washed out and the hand-held camera-work is ten times better than that seen in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Sound effects are excellent, the best I've heard, especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the film's climax. All these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic I've seen. The opening twenty minutes on Omaha Beach, which show the infamous D-Day landings, are everything you've heard: exhilarating, utterly depressing, disturbing, exciting, and gruesome. This is certainly the goriest war film out there and it's all portrayed in a matter-of-fact way; blink and you really will miss it. People explode, lose limbs, and bleed copiously from wounds; only strong stomachs need apply.The acting is uniformly great, as you'd expect from the calibre of cast on view. Tom Hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero, with unforgettable mannerisms ‚Äì the shaking hand still haunts me. Tom Sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant, and his larger-than-life persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here. Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg put in solid performances but it's Jeremy Davies who the film focuses on throughout ‚Äì a rookie, green-faced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare. The viewer understandably sees the film through Davies' eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be. Additionally, the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles ‚Äì especially Barry Pepper as the sniper and Vin Diesel at his best. Lots of familiar faces pad out other roles, some in cameos: Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, the list goes on.Despite the near-three hour running time, the film never slows up or stops for a minute. Every second is crucial and beautifully crafted. Things culminate in a set-piece climax, a fierce ambush in a bombed-out French town. Our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of Nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns. It's sprawling, explosive, upsetting and, by the last frame of the film, incredibly moving. So, in retrospect, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is everything everybody says it is. Spielberg's best film by far and one of the best war films of all time.~Leofwine_draca rated 9/10 on 10 December 2016"," Actually it's pretty GOOD history: I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you.~dedjim rated NA on 10 June 2001"," A strongly acted, powerful film that is unashamedly brutal!: This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times. But it deserves to be in the top 250, really it is that good! Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 15 March 2009"," I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made: Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 10/10 on 27 February 2006"," The most realistic harrowing battle scenes ever filmed...: Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail¬Ö For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach¬Ö No one was prepared for how horrific it really was¬Ö No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosions¬ÖYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go through¬Ö Within that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt.

Braveheart (1995) - IMDb,8.3,Mel Gibson|Sophie Marceau|Patrick McGoohan|Angus Macfadyen|James Robinson|Sean Lawlor|Sandy Nelson|James Cosmo|Sean McGinley|Alan Tall|Andrew Weir|Gerda Stevenson|Ralph Riach|Mhairi Calvey|Brian Cox|Peter Hanly|Stephen Billington|Barry McGovern,Mel Gibson,Randall Wallace,Scottish warrior William Wallace leads his countrymen in a rebellion to free his homeland from the tyranny of King Edward I of England.," ""Every man dies, not every man really lives."": The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 24 February 2020"," It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time: Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.On this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.Without trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.In addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.This movie is a masterpiece.~heisenberg12 rated 10/10 on 4 August 2019"," A Very Fast 3 hrs: What to say about Braveheart?This movie holds up against the challenge of aging, its exciting, adventurous, funny and passionate.The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible.Is it violent? Sure but what war isn't. I think Mel makes violence as much a part of the story in all his (relevant) films. The characters struggle through great violence and the impacts that is has on them, by not shying away from it we are allowed to get a small appreciation of it and them.The movie isn't OTT but delivers great action that serves the story and entertains the viewer.Its considered a classic film and so it is.~damianphelps rated 10/10 on 21 January 2021"," Your Heart is Free, Have the Courage to Follow It...: A simple message but even today, over seven hundred years later, there are far too many captive to their cultures, governments and institutions. They take a large slice, sometimes all of the freedoms William Wallace and so many others fought for. Keep up the fight because, like the tide, those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema, you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope, although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed, power and control.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 6 September 2020"," You should have courage to make this movie. ‚≠ê: Most of the times Hollywood movies is sided. I don't know what you believe but sadly this movie based on the truth. Only some of the minor subjects are added to make the movie more interesting. The additions were pretty minor most of the times, the main subjects is based on the truth.Doesn't matter which nation you are, I think you could love this movie so much. It's actually not only about wars and battles. It has so effective Romance subject. For me the actual subject. Also the movie shows how Freedom is important.Mel Gibson did something special. I don't know is there another movie like this? I'll explain the success I like in this movie. I don't have another example that any movie with great lead actor with achieving so many things. It has James Horner's brilliant scores, (that I don't know how didn't get the Academy Award) has amazing Cinematography, has amazing Costumes and Makeup, also has magnificent Set Decoration.I don't know how Mel Gibson managed to do all these when he's acting superbly. I know making a movie is not a personal job, It's more of a team job but I'm saying Gibson directed the movie so good while acting superbly.

OUR FREEDOM!~brentcollyer rated 10/10 on 12 March 2021"," One of the best modern movies of time: I'm talking just in the 90's. The 90's were a great time for the movies, we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""Braveheart"" is one of them. ""Braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time, I will watch this movie any day.Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history, anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love, he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""What will you do without freedom?!"", this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles, friends, traitors, and bloodshed, all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father ""They look at him and fight by his side."" He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track, it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie, a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 21 April 2002"," Brutal, But Epic Masterpiece: This is an emotional, involving and ultimately draining film. By the time you are done, you are spent. What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau, Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's ""army"" are fun to watch, too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence, this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fast-forward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the three-hour film, an ""epic"" adventure, if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film, for me, was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to, although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story. Whatever the accuracy, it's a great film and belongs in anyone's collection of epic-adventure masterpieces.The Blu-Ray transfer, by the way, is spectacular.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 25 March 2006"," Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love: I recently revisited Braveheart (1995) on Max. The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom.Directed by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull).Every aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film.In conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love. I would confidently rate it a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 10/10 on 29 October 2023"," Rebel Yell: My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible nobility, in particular the treachery of the future Scottish hero - King, Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since.~Lejink rated 8/10 on 9 November 2023"

So much money spent for this rather silly zombie flick and Zack Snyder got a nice paycheck for preparing and executing a script of a 10 year old. I don't even know where to start with this dumb script and scenes, let alone the enormous runtime of more than 2h, which completely killed this film.I thought I will see something cool once the starting titles went in; I found that small part a great start for a nice, interesting and intense Zack Snyder film. But little did I know...The dialogue is so bad that it is not even funny, the motivation of the protagonist(s) and the character development are non existent.

I could tell early on it was going to be bad, but it kept getting worse.Filled with eye-rolling moments, shockingly dumb parts, and things that make no sense. Like a lot. A lot a lot. Including parts that could have changed the entire course of the movie if the characters weren't so dumb in this poorly written script. They even do the anime trope of providing a ridiculous and unnecessary countdown to a deadline that they don't seem to follow at allHow could i forget... almost every single attempt at comedy fell completely flat. Not a chuckle, not even a smirk. Somewhere between crickets and rolling my eyes. And there was one comedic character that was one of the least comedic comedic characters i've ever seen.There were some cool action scenes but not too many. I liked the stylized gore (reminded me of spartacus). The movie was way too long due to the useless subplots. But even if it was shorter, there was nothing special here. Everything felt a little off. And i cared zero for any of the characters or their well-beings. (1 viewing, 5/31/2021)SPOILERSi decided to list some of the most memorable dumb parts:-when tanaka's guy betrayed the girl, they abandoned her when they could have easily saved her. And even worse, she stares into the eyes of her friend before she is killed and decides not to warn them that he might betray them all. Their lives are all in danger, but nah, let's just enjoy the moment-speaking of staring into each other's eyes, when bautista and his daughter get to the chopper and instead of immediately leaving they decide to have a moment which likely got him killed-right after that moment, zombie leader runs towards them as the pilot tries to leave as slowly as possible. But once the zombie is on board, she goes to fast-right before that moment, bautista brings his daughter to the chopper which is gone. ""she left us."" hmmmmmm i wonder if they are gonna do the fake-out where she comes back just when we thought all is lost.-multiple cringe-worthy self-sacrifice cliches-one guy shot a zombie in the eye and chin, underneath was a glowing blue eye and a metal chin. Yes, just like a terminator. I even paused it and went frame by frame to confirm. Makes no sense. Unless that's a hint about what ghost from power said earlier about a loop of the same mission. If so.... BOOOOOO-not so much a moment, but the entire subplot of saving the refugee mom was so pointless. Even worse, they didn't show us a scene of her reuniting with her kids, or even that she survives at all! In fact, the daughter character could have been completely removed without taking anything away from the movie other than runtime.-we need to get a zombie to activate the booby traps.... or we can just use one of these numerous dead bodies to do the same thing without the dangers of capturing a live zombie. Smh-the secret purpose of the mission is to get a zombie head. That could have been accomplished in 5 minutes without the elaborate money and safe-cracking-the zombie tiger did nothing for me. And that's coming from someone who loves tigers. It reminded me of a crappy version of the bear from the movie annihilation, which was legitimately terrifying.-the president decides to do the nuke a day early? Are you KIDDING ME?-they have an hour and 20 minutes to leave. Cracking the safe needs 30 minutes, which he seems to do in time. But now they have 20 minutes-in this 20 minutes they need to take this entire room full of cash to the roof. How is that going to happen?-they act like they successfully got the money, but it was one guy holding two backpacks, which were lost when the zombies ripped them open. They made it seem like that's the moment the money was lost. But it was an entire room full of money. And they showed that room later on, still filled with money.-there are probably 20 more things but i can't remember them.~FeastMode rated 2/10 on 1 June 2021"," A failed comedy: This film is directed and written by Zack Snyder?! It's garbage, from start to end. The only good bits in it are comedic and the rest is laughable, but not in a good way. It is a two hour and a half heist movie where everybody is an idiot. With zombies. They are idiots, too. The daughter, as usual, kills more people than the villains by being humane and in distress and, as unbelievable as it sounds, more of an idiot than everybody else.Then there is the acting. Dave Bautista moves like a grandpa. Theo Rossi, who did pretty well in Luke Cage, has a ridiculous role that makes no sense. Garret Dillahunt was good in the Terminator series, but he acts like a jester in this film. Tig Notaro is not really funny after being the highlight of Star Trek Discovery. Hiroyuki Sanada... oh, Hiroyuki Sanada... he was never a good actor, let's face it, but the depths to which he fails as an actor are truly amazing.And there is the story. A heist movie?! But with zombies that make no sense, with failed opportunities for sequels, with cardboard characters, with not one, but two straight white males that have to be brutally punished for their transgressions against women, with scenes like ""I didn't do it for the money! I did it for youuuuu!"". Jesus, it's worst than I am telling you it is, I just can't find the words to express the piece of excrement that this movie is.So if you are really really really drunk, this might be funny. I don't know. I've never been that drunk, but it could happen.~siderite rated 2/10 on 25 May 2021"," Messy, uninspired waste of time: Unlike the movie, I'll keep it short: I know this is a zombie movie and didnt expect anything but a fun, gory popcorn flick. But oh boy, was I setting myself up for disappointment. The movie is so full of lazy tropes, bad dialogue and plot holes that its basically unwatchable.If someone had just taken the time to correct some of the obvious errors and cut that bloated film down to 90 minutes it could have been great entertainment. But whoever was is charge here didnt care and what we got instead is an uninspired mess that just keeps dragging on.The sad part is that the movie had some cool ideas and a lot of people clearly put a lot of love into it. The actors are doing the best they can, special and pracitcal effects are cool and so are props and costumes. But that alone cant change the fact that script and editing are horrible. To add insult to injury the ending was completly unrewarding and left me feeling tired and annoyed.So even if you're just looking for entertainment: Dont watch this movie! Its an insulting waste of time.~t-feier rated 4/10 on 23 May 2021"," Dumb fun without the fun: Army of the dead begins as though it's going to be a fun B movie. 2 exchanges in different vehicles leads to disaster which leads to terror which leads to a fun title sequence in which we see a garish Las Vegas overrun by Zombies. This title sequence packs in a lot of story; in fact, in packs in about 90% of the movie's story.After that a bunch of people decide to go into Zombie-infested Vegas to get some loose cash, which is what the rest of the movie is. In spite of the absence of story, there's still a long chunk of time between the credits and the action which is filled with the strikingly dull enlisting of cannon fodder.You might have a few questions as the movie begins. Are the protagonists being mislead by the billionaire who puts this in place? Is the soldier they're forced to take along untrustworthy? Will someone sacrifice themselves for others even though they probably could have saved themselves as well? Will someone risk everyone's lives on a side mission? Will things suddenly become way more urgent? Will the characters be too undeveloped for you to care about them or their mission? Will this all result because no one in the movie even considered the possibility that things weren't what they seem? Will you be unsurprised at the ""surprise"" ending?If you don't know the answer to any of these questions then you've never seen a movie before and might like this one. Otherwise...There's little attempt to bring these characters to life except in several tediously emotional conversations between two characters you don't care about.Yes, there are some good moments here and there. The aforementioned opening credits. Zombie animals. A quiet scene with an unquiet finale. Occasional moments of good action or suspense. But it all gets suffocated by the length, the slack moments, the predictability, the stupidity, and the high ""who cares"" quotient.Zack Snyder is a hit or miss director, but normally his failures are from pretention and hubris. This time he didn't fail because he was too ambitious, but because he seemingly had no ambitions at all.~cherold rated 4/10 on 27 May 2021"," Seemed like it could be a mix of Zombieland, The Expendables, and Oceans 11, but it does not measure up to any of those! :-(: Some cool action and limited humor do not make up for crappy characters, crappy dialog, and a crappy story! :-(~stevebondi rated 4/10 on 22 May 2021"," Why was the Daughter character created in the first place?!: The Girl who plays the daughter of Dave does nothing,She probably deserved to die first,& what's with her connection with the random lady called Geetha?!She let her team in danger for some random lady and at the end she didn't even rescue her,What a piece of garbage this movie was for saving the girl who was hated by most of the audience...~deepkumar-spider rated 1/10 on 24 May 2021"," Bloated like a week old corpse, and stinks almost as much.: Of the five previous Zack Snyder films that I have seen, I have only enjoyed two, but one of those was his excellent 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, so I assumed that the man knows what he is doing when it comes to zombies. Army of the Dead has taught me to assume nothing. This is one of the dumbest zombie films I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). It's full of stupid characters making bad decisions, horrible plot developments, and ridiculous action, and worse still, every scene is either shot with an extremely short depth of field, or some kind of blur effect, which proves irritating in the extreme. Come to think of it, some of the CGI is pretty damn ropey as well (zombie tiger!).Dave Bautista is the star of this bloated two-and-a-half-hour undead crapfest, playing hard-nut Scott Ward, who gives up flipping burgers to assemble a team of tough mercenaries with the aim of liberating the zombie-infested city of Las Vegas of the cash still laying in its vaults. With a nuclear strike scheduled to hit the city in little over a day, the last thing they need are problems, such as Ward's daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) joining the mission to try and save a friend, or the traitor in their midst who is willing to sacrifice the others to line his own pockets.A heist movie crossed with the zombie genre should make for a great piece of escapism (I've long had an idea for a similarly themed film myself), but Snyder's screenplay is terrible, packed with unnecessary emotional drama (Ward's estranged relationship with his daughter is such a clich√©), moronic developments and plot threads that go nowhere (Kate's rescue mission). All of the mercenaries enter the zombie zone with bare arms, which is asking for trouble; the vault in which the money is kept is protected by booby traps that come straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; and why dream of running a sandwich truck if you're going to have $15m in the bank?Worst of all, Snyder's zombies are a special breed, guaranteed to irk most zombie purists: there are slow zombies called shamblers, which is fine, but Snyder also has Vegas inhabited by more intelligent zombies with amazing physical prowess, running at speed, dodging bullets like Neo from The Matrix, and performing incredible leaps, landing in a three-point superhero pose like Thor. Not only are they fast, but they are incredibly strong and seem to communicate in guttural growls and screeches. The leader is able to ride a horse (a zombie horse!), and has even somehow fashioned himself a bulletproof metal helmet. I struggled with Big Daddy from Land of the Dead, so all of this was a few steps too far.2.5/10, generously rounded up to three for the gore, of which there is plenty (the splattery opening credits is the best part of the whole film - it's downhill after that).N. B. Am I imagining it, or did Snyder 'take inspiration' from John Landis: in the opening scene of Army of the Dead, a soldier trips and falls; as his pal goes to lend a hand, he is attacked by a leaping zombie. It's almost identical in execution to the attack on the moors in An American Werewolf in London (my suspicions are compounded by the use of Bad Moon Rising on the soundtrack).~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 23 May 2021"
Gone with the Wind (1939) - IMDb,8.2,Clark Gable|Vivien Leigh|Thomas Mitchell|Barbara O'Neil|Evelyn Keyes|Ann Rutherford|George Reeves|Fred Crane|Hattie McDaniel|Oscar Polk|Butterfly McQueen|Victor Jory|Everett Brown|Howard Hickman|Alicia Rhett|Leslie Howard|Olivia de Havilland|Rand Brooks,Victor Fleming|George Cukor(uncredited)|Sam Wood(uncredited),Margaret Mitchell|Sidney Howard|Oliver H.P. Garrett(uncredited),A sheltered and manipulative Southern belle and a roguish profiteer face off in a turbulent romance as the society around them crumbles with the end of slavery and is rebuilt during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods.," Georgia on my mind: This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.~jotix100 rated 10/10 on 22 February 2005"," Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious: Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently.If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection.I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie.It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 21 October 2006"," About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood: I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.~planktonrules rated 10/10 on 5 August 2006"," The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review: At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background...Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell...~Turanic rated 10/10 on 12 June 2020"," Margaret Mitchell won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel on May 3rd, 1937: The year 1939 was a busy year for the Hollywood industry. Large-scale, majestic epics were front and center that year. You should look up the list of films released in 1939. It was a very, busy year, with huge titles from the golden age. Lots and lots of entertainment for a pre-WW2 audience. The Wizard of Oz (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and this little film, are just some of the titles on that list. Everyone was competing for perfection in the film industry. The first two hurtles, being sound and color film, had been implemented into the technical side of the filmmaking process, to this point in film history. Technicolor had been utilized for, about, five years to this point and it was perfectly utilized in this film too. Technicolor always was a good film stock, rich with colors, that pop on the screen. Head cinematographer, Ernest Haller's camera, captures images, not seen before on film and blazes colors across the screen, in Gone With the Wind (1939).I'm sure everyone knows the basic premise of the film. It boils down to a story about the life of woman, a daughter of a rich cotton plantation owner in 1860s, Georgia, who's life interweaves with the real life events of the American Civil War and the recovery and reconstruction years. It is a fictitious story utilizing events from the real world. Of course, most of us remember the picture on the movie posters of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), locked in that emotional, romantic embrace, plus it's on the cover of every DVD and Blu-Ray out there these days, but the film is really about Scarlett and all the other characters come into her circle. And, the film needs to be about Scarlett in order to be successful, because it is her spoiled, selfish, smug demeanor that energizes the whole film. Everyone who comes into her circle feels her wrath, even Rhett. Rhett isn't really a very likeable character either and watching these two unlikeable characters square off, through various parts of this film, is something to see. These are the reasons, that make this film so good. A plot involving two unlikeable characters, who eventually, reach a certain amount of maturity, that they earn some respect from the audience, doesn't deter from the overall quality of the film, because it is such a unique character study, while chaos is happening all around them.The film does contain many sub-plots, involving politically, socially, culturally and racially charged tones, which would be expected, considering the time this period piece takes place. Which, brings up another interesting point to this film. Even though this film is approaching 85 years old now in the 21st century, it is still considered a period piece. The interesting part is the filmmakers had a more recent memory of the events used in the film, being only 75 years before, as opposed to our view, which is roughly 150 years later. In fact, there probably were a couple of Civil War veterans still alive in 1939. Another amazing thing about this film is, they started shooting this thing in January, 1939 and released it just before Christmas that same year. That is impressive, considering the massive runtime of this film. It is the runtime of this film that really hurts it from being a perfect film.The images the filmmakers (I would list names, but you should see the Crew List on this film), are able to show us on the screen, is incredible. The color you will have stuck in your head, for a week after viewing this film, will be the color of orange, red fire, that is seen throughout the movie and obviously, mostly comes from the burning of Atlanta. A technical achievement, that hadn't been seen in the movies yet. The special effects, art direction, costuming and lighting is fantastic. You still don't notice, even today, that most of this movie was just filmed, out in the Los Angeles countryside and on sound stages. So much is going on in this film, you don't notice it. The performances by the cast is perfect. This is an epic journey about redemption and maturing. A maturity that helps the characters and a nation begin to grow. This film would roll through the Oscars in 1940, including winning the Best Picture Oscar.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.~PCC0921 rated 9/10 on 30 March 2022"," A Tempestuous Hurricane of a Tornado...: When a film is consistently recognised through the wisdom of the crowd, over so many years, as being great and epic and, for the duration of that film to run close to four hours - it really does suggest something a bit special. That something a bit special is a timeless story set during some of the darkest times in American history but it isn't the setting that makes this special, it's the story, the story of a cruel, selfish and manipulative opportunist performing her craft to perfection, it's the story portrayed through one of the greatest cinematic performances the world of movies has ever seen. While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh. Setting the bar so high it remains unparalleled, even to this day.~Xstal rated 9/10 on 29 September 2020"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema: Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-√†-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential.

It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.But for some idealistic spirits, ""Gone With the Wind"" resonates as one of the most heart-breaking pages of American History, when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty, Freedom and Justice, and when History, written by the victorious side, ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. ""Gone With the Wind"" chronicles what the South used to be, a world where coexisted two cultures, the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simple-minded Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) who knew nothing about ""birthin' babies"" and the wisdom and authority of Mammy, Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning role: two figures, two extremes, so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them, despite the obvious stereotypes.For literate minds, History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling, inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life, where the passing of time can be felt, when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic, sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), married to the gentle and extremely good-hearted cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable anti-heroine: selfish, greedy, jealous, but so brave, courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity, a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic ""As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again"".The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters: she doesn't care for etiquette, for traditions, her spirit is free, her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past, Scarlett thinks of the future, as she says: ""after all, tomorrow is another day"". Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler, Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston', is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era, they think of money, greed, prosperity, and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for, transcending the old-fashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War, the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.For many passionate hearts, this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen, a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strong-minded egos, two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley, the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude, probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War, too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth, a lost but so endearing cause, a fire that burnt inside, and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky, during Atlanta's big fire. Love has never been as passionate as a love-and-hate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause, mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett, lost in her love for Ashley, will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does, Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable come-uppance ever: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life, and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This ""I don't give a damn"" voted #1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge, and he sure deserved it... and many wannabe-Scarlett would admit that too.But while ""Gone With the Wind"" deals with lost causes, it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best- seller, it's one of the greatest films of all time, the greatest casting ever, the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's super-production that would become a landmark in film-making, with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors, forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree, during a beautiful sunset. Along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Gone With the Wind"" is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .~ElMaruecan82 rated 10/10 on 19 March 2012"," Even after years of being made.. it is good!: I wish people made more movies like this nowadays..Yes! The movie is LONG, but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her, to agreeing with her, to.. all sort of emotions!! It is well worth anyone's time.These characters feel SO real! It's like a perfect summarized soap opera. Anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book.

Casablanca (1942) - IMDb,8.5,Humphrey Bogart|Ingrid Bergman|Paul Henreid|Claude Rains|Conrad Veidt|Sydney Greenstreet|Peter Lorre|S.Z. Sakall|Madeleine Lebeau|Dooley Wilson|Joy Page|John Qualen|Leonid Kinskey|Curt Bois|Abdullah Abbas|Enrique Acosta|Ed Agresti|Arnet Amos,Michael Curtiz,Julius J. Epstein|Philip G. Epstein|Howard Koch,A cynical expatriate American cafe owner struggles to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the Nazis in French Morocco.," We'll always have ""Casablanca"" ...: A few movies managed to achieve such a legendary status. Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By' ¬Ö ta-da ta-da ta-daaa ¬Ö and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.One word : ""Casablanca"", and a gallery of characters revives, Sam, the piano player, these unforgettable second-billed actors who graced the silver screen in these black and white days, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, an international cast and so many immortal scenes, Rick Blaine's bourbon-driven melancholy while remembering the good old days with Ilsa, the patriotic fervor expressed during the singing of La Marseillaise and probably the most emotional farewell scene ever, followed by ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as the ending of a beautiful movie. Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture : ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own. But still, everything would all have been secondary if it wasn't for THE element that made ""Casablanca"" such a legendary film : it's a beautiful romance.60 years later, the movie still divides, should have Ilsa gone with Rick or Laszlo? The consensus is that she did the right choice, but there's no doubt that the truer love was Rick. The film perfectly captured the dilemma of a real triangular love as Ilsa's husband, Viktor Lazslo is fundamentally a good man, a heroic resistant fighter who escaped from a concentration camp, and the only man who inspired Rick Blaine a bit of admiration. As an ex-freedom fighter, Rick sure understands the value of courage and visibly, something from the past has metamorphosed his idealistic nature into the cynical and detached mask of a lone wolf figure. Who else than Humphrey Bogart could have played this role with such intensity? Intense but still profoundly romantic as the wound in Rick's heart opens when Lazslo comes back with Ilsa, Rick's former love, back then in Paris.The international atmosphere of the Rick's Caf√© nightclub gives it a unique and absolutely endearing flavor spiced up that pivotal night, when Ilsa asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By', we understand that this song has a poignant significance, as the last one she and Rick heard as lovers, before the War came and ruined everything. Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America. Rick exiled himself in Casablanca, as if something was unconsciously keeping him within the War, and when he delivers the legendary : ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" is he really lamenting? When Ilsa re-enters his life, his office, Rick's bitterness made him say the wrong words, but then he painfully realizes he still loves her, and that Lazlso took her from him.Lazslo and Ilsa need two 'letters of transit' to go to Lisbon, and by an ironic coincidence, Rick got those two tickets from a suave criminal named Ugarte who got them by murdering two German couriers. With the death of Ugarte, the two tickets for freedom were in Rick's hand and a great moral dilemma in his heart : contributing to the War effort and lose the love or his life, or following his motto : ""I stick my neck out for nobody"". Rick's true nature can't fool anyone, but the romance gains in complexity when Ilsa revealing to Rick why she left him, reconciles with him and realizes she loves him more than ever and can't leave him again. The romance is in a dead-end, and compromised by the antagonistic presence of the Major Heinrich Strasser who can't allow Lazzlo to escape. Strasser counts on the collaboration of Vichy's government, incarnated by Captain Renault, another character we still don't know where his heart belongs to, as he said : ""This is my least vulnerable spot"" Ultimately, and I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring, as said Roger Ebert in his brilliant commentary, all the characters aren't bad people. Even the ambiguity of Captain Renault is a nice writing touch that allows to keep uncertain the role he's going to play, although the roulette episode proved his good heart. Even Greenstreet as the head of the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival accepts to buy him out and keep all the employees, even Yvonne, the French girl who dated a Nazi officer couldn't hide her tears when the Marseillaise was sung. Finally, the heroic nature of Rick Blaine prevailed as he decided to take care of everything, fooling Ilsa, Lazzslo, and Renault, but ultimately getting them in the plane. Renault also redeemed himself by the ""Round up the usual suspects"" to clear Rick of shooting Major Strasser before he could order to cancel the flight.Rick, #4 hero in the American Film Institute, explains his decision to Ilsa : ""I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". He's twice wrong. First, Rick is excellent at being noble. Secondly, now that WW2 is over but not ""Casablanca""'s legendary status, whether you love old, classic, black and white films or not, you should ask yourself if the problems of three little problems aren't finally the essence of the most beautiful acts that humanity could inspire.~ElMaruecan82 rated 10/10 on 14 July 2011"," The Fundamental Things Apply...: ""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world.~slokes rated 10/10 on 16 January 2005"," A story that will never get tired, incredible film.: American in Casablanca, Rick Blaine holds the fate of his former lover Ilsa Lund and her husband, who's trying to flee The Nazis.I've just watched this film for the very first time, and I plan to watch it again on Christmas morning, before the events of the day start.What an enchanting, magical experience this couple of hours of viewing was, true screen greats bringing to life a magical story.Casablanca is not what I was expecting, it's a war film with a twist, a story seen through the eyes of people fortunate to escape Europe, it's a love story, with a difference.The characters are captivating, they all feel very real, a mix of hope and fear etched over their faces, a harsh reality to all of them, none of them are syrupy sweet or sentimental, you feel a true sense of desperation.Ingrid Bergman's finest hour, a gracious beauty, her presence is quite enchanting, Bogart delivers a superb performance, the presence of the pair is quite something, the whole cast are terrific.Amazing to think that this was made in the middle of The Second World War, indeed I believe several of The German characters, were German Jews who had fled The Nazis.Watching this was quite an experience, 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 22 December 2022"," HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE: There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch.""  Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.~Jaymay rated 10/10 on 23 August 2003"," .....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, As Time Goes By."": It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century. Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment. So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 8 March 2006"," Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman: Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++~smatysia rated 10/10 on 30 November 2004"," Now I finally know why this one is one of the best: Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.~Dockelektro rated 10/10 on 17 March 2003"," A perfect film.: Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people.~planktonrules rated 10/10 on 30 December 2008"," Wartime Themes: Love and sacrifice during WWII underlie the story about a caf√© owner named Rick (Humphrey Bogart), and his link to two intellectual refugees from Nazi occupied France. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and, like other European refugees, gravitate to Rick's upscale caf√©, near the city's airport, with its revolving searchlight.Rick is a middle-aged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism, especially for people in need, like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's caf√©, an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons, from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's caf√© that renders this film so appealing, with a variety of interesting accents, clothes, and uniforms. And, of course, there's Sam, the piano player, who plays all the favorites, including ""As Time Goes By"".All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script, with its colorful characters, like the debonair Captain Renault (Claude Rains); and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), the articulate and portly ""leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca"". And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's (Corinna Mura), whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.The film's dialogue, though substantial, is clever and lively, like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar: ""How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that; some day they may be scarce"".High-contrast B&W lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning; it evokes a feeling of far-off adventure.""Casablanca"" differs from traditional noir films, mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism, an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.~Lechuguilla rated NA on 28 November 2007"," Rick the Kasbah...: There's a bar is Casablanca called Rick's Caf√©, it attracts the kind of crowd that's gone astray, people looking for escape, in a world knocked out of shape, Victor Laszlo, Ilsa Lund, have found their way.

For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.""Dunkirk"" focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute. Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on ""Survivor"". He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then ""helps"" wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; ""There's no hiding from this thing son,"" he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of ""The Dam Busters"", but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of ""Atonement"".An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene. This is a film that demands more than one viewing.~tomsview rated 9/10 on 7 May 2018"," A tough, tough film to watch...and an amazing film was well.: Before you decide to watch ""Dunkirk"" I have a bit of a warning.

There's actually very little blood, but there are some drowning scenes which are intense and awful. Now I am not saying don't watch it...just be prepared.The story is a retelling of the escape of the British* from the beaches of Dunkirk. The German army was coming and the combined British and French forces were trapped with little apparent chance to escape. And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.By the way, early in the film you hear someone speaking to the pilot (Tom Hardy) over the radio. The voice is that of Michael Caine....an odd and brief cameo.The story is gripping, well told and brilliant. I have only one complaint, and I am surprised it made it to the film considering how amazing a director Christopher Nolan is. At one point, the scene switches between some men in a boat being attacked and a private yacht rescuing downed pilots. The scenes kept switching back and forth....but one was clearly at night and the other clearly was in daylight. This really didn't make any sense. Still, otherwise an amazing spectacle...a truly amazing war film.~planktonrules rated 9/10 on 30 April 2021"," A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters"": Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10~nimdude rated 10/10 on 22 July 2017"," Just Never Grabbed Me: I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no ""Tora Tora Tora"" or ""The Longest Day"" which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.~Hitchcoc rated 6/10 on 25 February 2018"," Straightforward And Gritty, But To Me It Missed The Mark Just A Bit: Director Christopher Nolan offers the viewer a pretty straightforward re-telling of the evacuation of British soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk in May of 1940, as the Germans encircled the town. The story is told from a strictly British perspective. Although we see some German planes involved in battles with RAF fighters as far as I can recall there isn't a single glimpse of a German soldier anywhere. Nolan then tells the story from three perspectives within that British perspective: on the land, on the sea and in the air. The land focuses on the solders awaiting rescue, the sea focuses mostly on the small private boats that made such a huge contribution to the effort (focusing on one boat in particular) and the air focuses on the battle by a small number of RAF pilots to protect their compatriots beneath against German planes. That structure was a bit confusing at first (especially as it was captioned on screen) but the story makes sense and that odd narrative structure is only a brief distraction.There's not really a main character involved in this. The point seems to have been to portray the breadth of the Dunkirk evacuation at the expense of character depth. There's also no one moment that seems truly central, which means that the movie strikes you in the end of not really having built up to anything (aside from the actual evacuation, which admittedly is the most important thing.) But in some respects that made this movie seem at times less of a drama and more of a docu-drama if that makes any sense. The story-telling was a little bit lacking. I did appreciate that while the heroism of the British soldiers was front and centre, there was no shying away from a few more negative portrayals - shell-shocked soldiers, soldiers who just didn't want to fight anymore, soldiers who wouldn't even help their French allies. In that sense, this had a somewhat gritty feel, as befits a war movie.It's not a bad movie. To me, it just missed the mark a little bit in terms of what I was expecting. (6/10)~sddavis63 rated 6/10 on 2 November 2019"," Put Down the Kool-Aid: Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). ""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous.Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre.The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes.As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone.This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10.~Better_Sith_Than_Sorry rated 5/10 on 21 July 2017"," Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated: ""Dunkirk"" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Dunkirk""~claudio_carvalho rated 3/10 on 7 December 2017"," A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.: Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.~criticadelcinema rated 7/10 on 19 July 2017"," Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle: Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.~somf rated 10/10 on 17 July 2017"," An exquisite film.: Awards will follow.How often can any of us say that a film lives with us for days, I've not been able to add that tag to anything I've seen in years. Within the first few moments of this film I knew this was going to be such a film. Most of us will know the incredible Dunkirk story, the fear many would have had I think would have been that the story was sensationalised, or lacking the real essence. All you can say is Christopher Nolan has once again shown his genius, this film is a masterpiece. You have no choice but to feel raw emotion as you watch, feelings of despair, hope, anger, fear, terror, you will feel exhausted having watched this film.The acting is impeccable, every single member of the cast performs to an incredible standard (maybe Harry Styles's character will irritate one or two,) Mark Rylance is utterly sensational, as is Kenneth Branagh, the scene where his character looks up and sees the fishing boats arrive is one of the most moving in the filmThe camera-work is astonishing, as is the music, which for me was one of the most powerful elements of the film, it built tension to enormous degrees.There is a realism in this film which I find quite incredible, at times it's so difficult to watch, it brought elements to life I hadn't even thought of. I can see this being used in history lessons of the future.The only real question is how many awards will this win. See this film, it's utterly incredible.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 July 2017"

For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.""Dunkirk"" focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute. Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on ""Survivor"". He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then ""helps"" wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; ""There's no hiding from this thing son,"" he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of ""The Dam Busters"", but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of ""Atonement"".An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene.

Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10.~Better_Sith_Than_Sorry rated 5/10 on 21 July 2017"," Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated: ""Dunkirk"" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Dunkirk""~claudio_carvalho rated 3/10 on 7 December 2017"," A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.: Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.~criticadelcinema rated 7/10 on 19 July 2017"," Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle: Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.~somf rated 10/10 on 17 July 2017"," An exquisite film.: Awards will follow.How often can any of us say that a film lives with us for days, I've not been able to add that tag to anything I've seen in years. Within the first few moments of this film I knew this was going to be such a film. Most of us will know the incredible Dunkirk story, the fear many would have had I think would have been that the story was sensationalised, or lacking the real essence. All you can say is Christopher Nolan has once again shown his genius, this film is a masterpiece. You have no choice but to feel raw emotion as you watch, feelings of despair, hope, anger, fear, terror, you will feel exhausted having watched this film.The acting is impeccable, every single member of the cast performs to an incredible standard (maybe Harry Styles's character will irritate one or two,) Mark Rylance is utterly sensational, as is Kenneth Branagh, the scene where his character looks up and sees the fishing boats arrive is one of the most moving in the filmThe camera-work is astonishing, as is the music, which for me was one of the most powerful elements of the film, it built tension to enormous degrees.There is a realism in this film which I find quite incredible, at times it's so difficult to watch, it brought elements to life I hadn't even thought of. I can see this being used in history lessons of the future.The only real question is how many awards will this win. See this film, it's utterly incredible.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 July 2017"

As an infantry battalion assembles to wage war deep in enemy territory, two soldiers are assigned to race against time and deliver a message that will stop 1,600 men from walking straight into a deadly trap."," ""He travels the fastest who travels alone"": There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, 'Spectre' is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman's score for 'Road to Perdition' is a favourite.'1917' was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019's year's best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for '1917' is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).First and foremost, '1917' is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins' cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. '1917' benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.Overall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10.~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 13 April 2021"," One Shot Cinematography?: Watching 1917, the audience might discern its apparent single-shot presentation, a testament to director Sam Mendes' remarkable craftsmanship. Is it filmed in one shot? A minimum of 34 discreet edits were subtly introduced to create the illusion of a continuous shot. This prompts speculation about the extent of the set, given the limited number of cuts, particularly within a wartime backdrop.Transitioning to the narrative and cast evaluation, the film embarks on a riveting journey. The ensemble, including delivers a commendable performance. The artistic nuances employed to bolster the script, characters, pivotal moments, and conflicts resonate as an exquisite touch.The film doesn't merely captivate with its story but also portrays a natural splendor, subtly showcasing its essence. I couldn't recall watching any movie with only 2 female characters including a baby girl.My experience was satisfying although it doesn't rely heavily on suspense or thrills. It is a delightful watch!~pawanpunjabithewriter rated 8/10 on 21 August 2023"," Reasonably accurate in showing the hell that is war.: I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched ""1917"" because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned.~planktonrules rated 9/10 on 10 April 2020"," Another Day In One Long Take: The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me.~boblipton rated 8/10 on 10 January 2020"," An achievement: It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019.~aivilovee rated 9/10 on 12 December 2019"," We're living in such wonderful times...: 1917 is a poem.Is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI.This movie made me leave the movies with tears in my eyes as if I have had a time travel experience to the World War I, and then waking up and realizing how wonderful are the times we are living in.1917 is a must see movie for everyone.~diegosays rated 10/10 on 7 January 2020"," A technical masterpiece: Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes.~eelen-seth rated 8/10 on 6 December 2019"," While its undeniable that it is a Visual Masterpiece...: It still wasn't fully satisfying for me.Obviously the story is pretty much one line: deliver this message. This is ok, not every movie needs to be packed with story. But then it shouldn't waste too much time either, it should be faster paced, there should always be something to look at that's actually interesting. The stapled corpses get boring at some point.The biggest problem I had with this movie, were the unnecessary coincidences.1) The germans take every step to not leave food or anything behind, yet there is exactly 1 cow and 1 milk bucket left. Which leads to2) In the town the protagonist jump exactly into this 1 house wherw there's also a baby that needs this milk.3) The rat. It just runs into the trap exactly when our protagonists are there. Of course.4) The plane. You guessed it: It lands exactly at our heroes feet. And they decide to help the german guy (why?) which leads to Blakes death.Other than that, the movie really was spectacular and a feast for this eyes. But it is a movie with just a few too many problems to really shine for me.~aarongnr rated 7/10 on 16 January 2020"," 1917 recruits you to experience a war journey done in an impressive ""one-shot"" style that I can't say i've seen before: Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U. S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself.~RforFilm rated 8/10 on 17 January 2020"," Epic in All Proportions...: You're on a mission to deliver key instructions, that will halt significant, headcount reductions, but to get to where you need, you'll have to weave, bereave, believe, avoiding terminal pitfalls, lethal obstructions.Leaving you under no illusion of the hell suffered by those during The Great War, telling an amazing tale of bravery, determination, conviction and courage, through spectacular cinematography, editing, set design and dialogue, all layered through huge performances by the cast, none more so than that from George MacKay, who carries you, as well as a great burden, through the torment and the trenches of man's inhumanity to man.~Xstal rated 10/10 on 30 October 2022"

It stars Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Marton Csokas, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Alexander Siddig, David Thewlis, Ghassan Massoud and Edward Norton. Cinematography is by John Mathieson and music scored by Harry Gregson-Williams.Director's Cut, two words that has these days come to mean a marketing ploy to get the home movie fan to part with more cash. Except maybe when they call it something else, such as Unrated Edition or Extended Edition, the Director's Cut has rarely been more than the original theatrical version with some added bits sewed back in. Case in point Ridley Scott's own Gladiator. But Scott is a big advocate of the home formats available to us, and what he says in his introduction on these releases are always telling. Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut is one of the rare cases that deserves the label, it is the cut Scott wanted and with 45 minutes extra in the film, it's now a fully formed epic and without doubt a better film than the one the theatrical cut suggested.Nutshell plotting finds the story set during the Crusades of the 12th century. Balian (Bloom) is a French village blacksmith who after finally meeting his father Godfrey (Neeson), sets him on a course to aid the city of Jerusalem in its defence against the Muslim leader Saladin (Massoud). Saladin is battling to reclaim the city from the Christians. It's a fictionalised account of Balian de Ibelin the man, but with the Crusades featuring so rarely in movies it's good to see one with attention to detail in relation to the events and time period.Now this version exists there is no reason to visit the theatrical cut, for although this has one or two missteps in the narrative, big holes have been plugged and characters importantly expanded. Benefiting the most are Eva Green as Sibylla, and Bloom himself as Balian. The former now gets substance on why she transforms from a measured princess to a borderline head-case, and the latter gets a back story which helps us understand why he does what he does. Both actors performances are seen in better light as their characters become more defined. Neeson and Norton, too, also get more screen time, and that can never be a bad thing.In this day and age the topicality of the film as regards Muslims and Christians is obviously hard to ignore, but Scott and Monahan are not in the market for political posturing. Scott had long wanted to do a film about The Crusades, to make it an historical epic adventure reflecting the period, and he has achieved that without head banging messages. In fact the culmination of the films major battle comes by way of tolerance, compassion and mutual respect, not by over the top histrionics or side picking. It's a crucial point to note that the makers have not demonized the Arab leaders, both Saladin and Nasir (Siddig) are portrayed as intelligent and cultured men of standing. Their drive and determination coming off as respectful as Balian's defence of Jerusalem is. They also provide the film with two of its best acting performances. Impressive considering the film is full of very good acting turns.It will come as no surprise to fans of Scott's work to find that Kingdom of Heaven is tremendous on production value. Filled out with astonishing visuals and no overuse of CGI, it's arguably Scott's best production: it's certainly his most ambitious. Filmed in Spain and Morocco, the makers easily whisk us back centuries to the France and Jerusalem of the time, the ability to plant us firmly in the time frame is not to be understated. Mathieson (Gladiator) is a big part of that, his colour lensing for France (metallic cold blues) and Jerusalem (dusky yellow and brown hues) is a visual treat and integral to the feel of the story. While Gregson-Williams' score rarely gets a mention, but it's very at one with Scott's vision, a delightful mix of ethnic strains, mystical flair and medieval emphasis. Scott also ups the ante for visceral battles, the horrors of war never more vivid as they are here. Supremely constructed, the siege of Jersualem is one of the finest in cinema, the first sight of fireballs igniting the night sky bringing the hairs on the back of the neck standing to attention. It's just one of many great moments that form part of Scott's breath taking epic.Badly treated on cinema release by the studio, who even marketed that cut badly, Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut is these days worthy of a revisit and deeper inspection. For rich rewards await the genre faithful. 9.5/10~hitchcockthelegend rated 10/10 on 18 May 2011"," Definitely deserves to be seen on a big screen but the Director's Cut is top notch.: I first saw this in a theatre in 2005 and inspite of owning a dvd (theatrical version) i never revisited it but revisited the 194 mins Director's Cut few days back.The film has amazing visuals, the landscapes n the battle scenes are stunning.While these kinda movies are enjoyed on the big screen, the Director's Cut makes more sense and has many scenes included, battle scenes are depicted with more violence than in the theatrical cut and the subplot involving Sybilla's son Baldwin V, is added but its very poignant.Also more scenes with Hospitaller offering guidance to Balian are present in the Director's Cut. But a scene where Hospitaller guides Balian after Balian survives an attack by Guy's men looked a bit supernatural.I am generous with a 9 cos the movie is very entertaining.Wud have easily rated it a 10 if the makers wud have given more footage to the character of Saladin, a true chivalrous knight.It is equally true that his generosity, his piety, devoid of fanaticism, that flower of liberality and courtesy which had been the model of our old chroniclers, won him no less popularity in Frankish Syria than in the lands of Islam - Ren√© Grousset (writer).Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).~Fella_shibby rated 9/10 on 5 June 2021"," Listen to the other reviews when they say get the Director's Cut of this movie: I watched the Director's Cut of this movie, which is why I rate it so high. Truly one of the best medieval movies of all time, just do yourself a favor and watch it. Sure, the movie is very long, but trust me, the movie is very well worth your time. Don't waste your time on the theatrical version, it's missing essential minutes that are include in the DC. So yeah, basically, if there was a movie to get the DC for instead of the regular cut, it's this one.~hugosoup rated 7/10 on 4 April 2019"," Watch the 3+ Hour Director's Cut, not the Studio's 2+ Hour Butchered Cut: There are two versions of this movie that are strikingly different in their impact and emotional meaning. The theatrical release is a 2-plus hour-long studio edit. The director's cut is 3-plus hour-long edit that was released later. I watched both versions back-to-back, and without question, the director's cut is the superior. It's not just a matter of additional footage putting more meat on the bone--more heart is added to the film as well.The movie is a violent and gritty portrayal of the Crusades era in medieval times, but wrestles artfully with complex issues of faith, morality, justice and diversity and what it means to live a godly life. Apparently, the studio decided such thematic depth was a drawback and that audiences are mostly superficial morons, so they insisted on an edit that presented it as an action movie, leaving in just enough character development to feebly sew the action scenes together. In the process, not only character motivation was lost, but important plot developments in the story.After watching the shorter edit first--which seemed disjointed and filled with holes in the way of crappy edits--I had to go look up the movie's synopsis online to understand what the hell I had watched. In the director's cut, it was much clearer. But the biggest difference is the thought-provoking character development and dialogue scenes throughout that bring an intelligence to the primitive times being depicted.At the end of the studio edit, I felt uninspired and filled with a sense that the movie had many missed opportunities.At the end of the director's cut, I felt I had seen a real movie with real ideas. And I was left thinking about it.Ridley Scott has had some bad luck with studio interference in his edits, most memorably with the two versions of ""Blade Runner."" You would think they'd trust his instincts after all this time.~Walter_Probinsky rated 8/10 on 27 April 2019"," Great: A exceedingly good film, it was true, dramatic, and amazing. the cast was perfect in their roles, espically Edward Norton. This movie had an amazing plot, characters, and historical accuracy. On the bonus the action was awesome too, Kingdom of Heaven is a must see.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 4 February 2020"," Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven is visually stunning and a superb film: Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott's epic historical film that many found bad with the theatrical cut myself have never seen it but I went straight to the Director's Cut which is the definitive version and I agree. The whole production is massive and impressive, cinematography and the direction of Ridley Scott makes every scene visually stunning, making every scene stand out with expensive and incredible sets. It didn't take long for me to get immersed into the 12th Century and Balian's adventure to Jerusalem as it felt that I was there with them. Now this movie isn't for anyone as it's over three hours long but I found it amazing from start to finish and my interest with that period of time, the medieval times helped a lot. For me it's a masterpiece in its genre, the Director's Cut that is.The ensemble cast is massive and the cast who plays the respective characters all do an excellent job, bringing the characters to justice and their best to portray the real people behind the characters. What I loved is that every character isn't black and white, there's lots of grey characters that you can't really place in any category of evil or good. Orlando Bloom does a great job in leading the movie as we see it mostly from his eyes, the big names around him makes it the fantastic ensemble they are.The costume and prop department are one of the best things about the movie as without it, it wouldn't really feel immersive or realistic but what we got was a impressive amount of swords, flags, costumes and armor and when they wear the costumes and swords they become the characters.~Holt344 rated 10/10 on 8 February 2020"," Best example of ""See the Director's Cut"": Many of the reviews above I agree with, but I also saw the theatrical version and was very disappointed (6 out of 10). When the Director's Cut came out it was 45 minutes longer, so you fear the worst, MORE of the same. In this case, the story line is filled out and the motivations and characters are fleshed out. Eva Green went from, ""why is she in this movie"" with virtually no screen time and less dialog to a major character who moves the plot, as you would hope given her billing. The opening scenes in France are greatly expanded and meaningful. The action scenes are better, but not substantially. The Director's cut should have been the official version of the movie, the theatrical cut is a poor excuse.~Pete-235 rated 9/10 on 2 August 2012"," Triumph of the working class: ""Why was the Crusader braver then the pirate? Because he fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took Spain from us, though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic Church, we swept them back to Africa.""Clearly, director Ridley Scott does not agree with the above somewhat simplified philosophy expressed by Shaw through his character Don Juan. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", wars and battles are fuelled by an assortment of motivations including land, money, political consideration, natural desire for violence, lust for fame, love of the common people, among others. Even more importantly, this ""idea"" thing does not prevent leaders from practicing tolerance, reaching compromises and even recognizing equality with alien faiths, as the movie tries to show us. Recognizing that this movie is a mix of historical fact and dramatized fiction, let me focus on one rather unusual aspect of the hero Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith inheriting knighthood and an estate from a father appearing out of the blues. As Balian takes over the barren desert estate after the untimely death of the recently-discovered father, he does something that the father apparently has failed to do in all these years ¬ñ dig into the earth to find a reliable source of water and proceed to make the estate productive. Later, the resilient defence of Jerusalem owes just as much to Balian's knowledge of practical laws of mechanics as to his military skills. In the end, he turns away from the inherited knighthood and goes back to be a blacksmith, taking with him a queen. Triumph of the working class, as my summary line suggests.Depiction of the arch adversary Saladin follows very much the line taken in the novels of Sir Walter Scott (another Scott here!), particularly ""The Talisman"", as someone mysterious (to the extent of being almost omnipresent - in the novel) but wise and benevolent, a breed of political leader that is sadly in short supply today. The hero Balian, as mentioned, has little interest in divinity and every interest in the welfare of the people. These two leaders, put in today's context, could qualify ""Kingdom of Heaven"" for a fairy tale.It's difficult to refrain from comparing the attack of Jerusalem with the attack of Minas Tirith, and this very comparison can be construed as an unreserved compliment on Kingdom of Heaven. Another comparison that can be made is the depiction of a mighty army, done so unimaginatively in two similar movies last year. In Kingdom of Heaven, we see first a solitary figure on horseback at a distant mountain gap. ""Saladin's army of 200 thousand is here"" says Balian. ""There's only one person"", comes the reply from a follower. ""No, they're all here"" Balian quietly responses, at which point the angle of the camera starts to rise, first revealing the patch behind the mountain gap, filled with soldiers. Then, as the horizon of our vision continues to extend, layers of mountains and vales continue to appear, together with Saladin's mighty army deployed in an apparently haphazard, but ultimately strategic fashion. This must be seen to appreciate. Of the cast, I must first mention Edward Norton. As the leper king of Jerusalem, he appears all the time behind a mask which covers his entire face, showing only his eyes with disfigured corners. But it's the voice that is so mesmerizing. Ever since Fight Club, Norton's voice has such a timbre that soft as he sounds, there are lurking behind tantalizing hints of subtlety, intrigue, compassion, power, and twenty other different and conflicting emotions all at once.Bloom grows into his role, starting rather expressionless (which may not be totally unreasonable considering that the character has just lost a wife and a child) but gradually gaining in confidence. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, playing father and mentor respectively, do not exactly have the most challenging parts in their careers. Eva Green retains the girlish defiance in The Dreamer, but adds to it the maturity and allure required for the role of Sibylla (as portrayed by the script, but not necessarily as recorded in history). And there is good old Brendan Gleeson, in the customary role of big bully fighter which he has perfected in Gangs of New York and Troy. Kingdom of Heaven is one cut above Troy and Alexander last year.~harry_tk_yung rated NA on 6 May 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Kingdom of Heaven: Kingdom of Heaven in 2005 will be what Gladiator was in 2000. Ridley Scott has delivered a worthy follow up to his Oscar winner, which is also based on medieval times, with a central heroic character, and supporting casts of characters based on history.The sets are as spectacular, instead of just Rome and the Collesuem, we have the Middle East and Jerusalem. The costumes are beautiful, from intricately remade Knights armour, to the desert garb of the Muslim warriors. The soundtrack is a mixture of sounds with middle eastern influences, but somehow pales in comparison with Gladiator and lacks a central theme.Much is said about how the film portrays religion, given the sensitive subject of the Crusades, but I feel that Ridley has achieved a wonderful balance between how Christianity and Islam are portrayed. Both are given fair airtime on their ideologies, and the film tries to preach (pardon the pun) about tolerance, yet highlights the dangers of fanatical followers of both religions, of misguidance from men in search of worldly power.Which Christianity took a beating - where senseless battles are waged in the name of Christ, where insensitivity breed contempt. Preists are cast in negative light and given lines like ""convert to Islam, repent later"" when all around seems lost. It is emphasized in the show that what matters is in your head and in your heart - that noble actions speak louder than mere empty and repetitive ""praise the Lord"" chants, as if that will protect you during Judgement Day.Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith who became a fugitive, but inherited land and army from his father, Godfrey, played by Liam Neeson. The film can be broadly categorized into 3 acts - the first in which Balian searches for his identity and new life in Jerusalem, the second in which the focus is on religion and politics of the time, and the last, the spectacular siege and war.Bloom puts up a commendable performance, so to his detractors out there, you're in for a big surprise. Edward Norton had the difficult task of acting through a mask as leper King Baldwin, and I applaud Ridley's decision of casting real Muslim actors to learn from them.Fans of Eva Green might be disappointed that the relationship between Balian and Queen Sibylla was played down to focus on the battles, but I feel it's a fair trade off.Firstly, some of you might not like the quick-cut-MTV style editing in Gladiator's fight scenes, especially the close ups. This is repeated here though, in a blood splattering manner. The pan-out and general landscape sweeps are mindblowing, and will leave you wanting more. Think about the battles that you see Lord of The Rings Two Towers and Return of the King - the siege on Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith - Kingdom of Heaven delivers the equivalent, probably even better (without the fantasy elements). This is one medieval war movie whose battles will stick in your mind for some time.The audience were the only disappointing experience for me - they were laughing at a dialogue near the end, where a ""knight"" asked who Balian was, and he answered ""I'm the blacksmith"", in which the ""knight"" answered ""I'm the King"". Laughter was abound in the theatre. I was like, HELL-O people! See that lion motif on his armour? That's Richard the Lionheart! D'uh! The Crusades didn't end there, it waged on...What is Jerusalem worth? Nothing, everything. Watch this, and in my opinion, it has Oscar written all over it. Now to hit the library and research more on the subject!~DICK STEEL rated 10/10 on 4 May 2005"," Some history...: Kingdom of Heaven is an entertaining and spectacular film, to say the least. However, being an enthusiast of the history of the crusader states, I would like to mention some historical facts and accuracies that generated the film.For a start, all the main characters of the film are historical figures, from Balian to the unfortunate Baldwin IV (oftenly referred as ""Baldwin the Leper""). However, the only connection of Balian and Sybilla was that he indeed helped her defend Jerusalem and negotiated its subsequent surrender to Saladin. However, he was not only a political opponent of her husband (Guy de Lusignan), but also of HERS.You see, Sibylla actually loved Guy enough as to fight to make him a king, even if the barons of the kingdom were against him. She actually tricked them: She agree to divorced him before her coronation, with the only term to choose herself her new husband. When the barons accepted, she just chose to remarry Guy and established him in the throne of Jerusalem. Balian was married with her stepmother, mother of her half sister Isabella (completely ignored in the film). He conspired with Maria to have another noble, Conrad of Montferrat, marry Isabella, giving Conrad a stronger claim to the kingdom.Sibylla actually succeeded her son from a previous marriage (Baldwin V), not her brother, as the film suggests. He was a child-king that succeeded his leper uncle but lived only for one year. Indeed Guy was captured in the Battle of Hattin. When Saladin was besieging the Holy City (and Sybilla personally led the defense) and she was permitted to escape to Tripoli with her daughters. However she died of an epidemic 3 years later in Tyre, the only city in the kingdom that did not fall. Her daughters also died of the same epidemic, and Guy (by now released) lost the kingdom of Jerusalem and was compensated with the Lordship of Cyprus by Richard the Lionheart.Balian died 3 years later. He NEVER retired from the politics of the kingdom as the film suggests.~pmitsi rated NA on 15 May 2005"

The cinematography, performances, battle sequences sound design are all top notch. I do feel as if the movie became a little too scattered before the big battle halfway through the movie, and could have done a better job developing characters. It's a minor complaint but you will feel the runtime of the movie during certain points.One scene that will stay with me for a long time was the sequence in the crater. I was a complete and utter mess during that whole sequence. Seeing Paul gain his humanity back for the fallen soldier absolutely broke me.All Quite on the Western front may not saying anything new about war, but it's a relevant-sobering reminder of the futility of war. One that will stay with you long after the credits roll.~bbevis-47954 rated 8/10 on 28 October 2022"," Powerful and bloody.: This is not strictly-speaking an adaption of Erich Maria Remarque's classic. A few minor incidents from the novel are included, but Remarque's biggest contribution to this film is the title. Given the ending of the film (as opposed to the book) the title is somewhat misleading, but it's such a classic that the film-makers' decision is quite understandable.This is a brutal and uncompromising study of the realities of war. The fact the the war depicted took place more than a hundred years ago doesn't make it any less relevant. It could be shown in Ukraine today, and soldiers on both sides would understand.Nor is the film's anti-war message terribly new. It is, however, a message that needs to be repeated over and over again, until (maybe) enough people take it seriously.The battle scenes are appallingly visceral - possibly the best of their type since the opening of Saving Private Ryan.The history of any war is written by the winners, but that doesn't stop them being a tragedy for the poor grunts on the losing side as well.~Lomax343 rated 9/10 on 20 October 2022"," Rough brutal material: This movie did something I didn't expect from a World War movie...it makes you feel empathetic for the Germans. To an extent.I'm no war buff so I'll leave the realism to the experts but what this movie does is show you the first World War from the view point of people who've never experienced or even conceived of war and bloodshed on this scale. It starts off with new recruits full of patriotism for their country expecting to be sent on a grand adventure only to have those expectations quickly shattered. Turns out war isn't fun, and not even initially due to the actual fighting. Just training and constantly being screamed at and controlled while marching your days away is brutal. Remember, while vehicles existed, they weren't common use at this period of time...these soldiers had to walk, walk, and walk some more to get to where the war effort was taking place. And even if they had vehicles most of those places didn't have roads yet to drive them on. Then there's the constant lack of food and water, rough sleeping conditions, being exposed to the elements. Just GETTING to the war is brutal. That's a good 3rd of the movie right there.Then close to the half way point, after a few minor skirmishes, we see the war front and the trenches and get to see what that's like. Well...it's terrible! You pop up out of a trench and boom...you're shot. And that's just life in between charges. There was no strategy to the charges either, they relied on waves of bodies to gain even 100 meters, hoping to out pace the bullets constantly coming your way. Millions of young men died in this fashion, their bodies littering the field.The most brutal part of the film is the weapons of war never before seen. Tanks, flame throwers, planes dropping bombs. Men screaming in pure terror while the bullet proof tanks drive over them, while flames fill their trenches, or planes blow them up while they flee.And the odd thing is since we're seeing it from the eyes of the young German soldiers, who are truly clueless as to why they're really even fighting, you do empathize and feel sorry for them. You find yourself even rooting for them. This movie humanizes them but importantly shows the politicians who are truly to blame for the atrocities. The powerful men behind the scenes, bloated from being overfed on rich foods, hundreds of miles away from the pain and suffering they cause.I have no idea how accurate this movie is but it's a pretty straight forward piece showing just how awful, terrifying, and destructive this period of time was. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to any fans of this genre.~terrencepatrix rated 8/10 on 1 November 2022"," 'Every Day a Year, Every Night a Century'...: In the excellent 1930s original, war is seldom better summarised than by: 'It's dirty and painful to die for your country, when it comes to dying for your country it's better not to die at all. There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good does it do?'.It's a statement that applies just as well today, and complimented by this outstanding piece of film making too, which leaves us under no illusions of man's inhumanity to man. The performances are truly incredible, the technical achievement recreating scenes of war outstanding, and the messages as clear as any about the futility of armed combat and the inability of the human race to learn its lessons - even to this day. Not really a film to enjoy, but certainly a film to reflect on how far we haven't come since 1918, especially in a world that often seems so intent on pulling itself apart.~Xstal rated 9/10 on 30 October 2022"," Great adaptation and remake: Germany, May 1917. 17-year-old Paul Baumer enthusiastically enlists in the German army and heads off to war. His head is filled with patriotism, honour, visions of heroism and the confidence that Germany will win the war. He soon learns that his impressions of war are far from the reality.Erich Maria Remarque's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was first published in 1929. It was quite revolutionary, depicting the horrific reality of war rather than the glamourous, sanitised version. In a sense it was the first anti-war novel. It was so unflinching in its portrayal of WW1 that the Nazi party regarded it as treasonous and had the book banned and stripped Remarque of his German citizenship, causing him to flee to Switzerland and ultimately the US.In 1930 Hollywood made the book into a movie. It was superb, capturing well the horrors that Remarque depicted in his book. It deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture (and Best Director) in 1930.In 1979 it was adapted again, this time as a made-for-TV movie. Despite being directed by Delbert Mann and boasting a star-studded cast (Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasance) this version was far from being in the same league as the 1930 version and didn't do the book justice. It is quite tame and the performances are quite subdued.This, the 2022 version, once again captures the essence of the book and is quite unflinching in its portrayal of war. Graphic scenes and realistic plot show the wastefulness and horror of war.Not as good as the 1930 version though: the characters aren't as fully developed, limiting engagement, and the plot feels a bit padded. A few drawn out scenes could easily have been shorter without losing any detail. Some style-over-substance elements too as the director went overboard with the special effects he had at his disposal (the French counter-attack with tanks and flamethrowers is a good example). The droning sound didn't help either (clearly the director has watched Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"").~grantss rated 8/10 on 29 October 2022"," Bleak meaningful meaninglessness.: I'm truly conflicted: ""All Quiet on The Western Front"" is a surprisingly stark & cold film upon first watch, capturing the futility of war, loss of youth & corruption of innocence with an unsettling lack of emotion throughout.It's something I couldn't help but notice as I tuned in; usually in historical war films (like Sam Mendes' ""1917"" for instance, following events through the eyes of the opposing British side), we're accustomed to typically witnessing soldier's actions depicted as valiant & honourable, with a palpable sense of pride & patriotism embedded throughout - in pieces which are made to catalogue their innumerable brave achievements conducted by every-day folk (who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in the trenches), in spite of insurmountable odds comprehensively stacked against them... But here, there's no dignity in anything that transpires; obstacles aren't admirably overcome, the ensemble don't conduct themselves in a way which is befitting of their station, worthy of respect & none of the characters win any semblance of what could honestly be described as ""glory""... They're just young, impressionable fools - drunk on propaganda - who have mindlessly partaken in the unwarranted military occupation of foreign land, where they are obviously not welcome by the inhabitants. Due to this, there's a void of relatability & moreover, all the team of participants can dream of - once they arrive at the front - or endeavour to guarantee for themselves is survival, not greatness.However, despite this inability to sympathise being an irksome grievance of mine, in the production's defense, I suppose that's actually intentional & rather the whole point (?), since it's meant to tell the story through the perspective of the vanquished, not the conquerors, reflecting how naive recruits (who'd been fatally misled, in conscripting themselves & their families in the first place) were gradually numbed to their feelings by the constant mental & physical anguish inflicted upon them in a continuous onslaught of pointless offensives (instigated by their generals), once reality had firmly bitten & they'd been collectively disabused of this fantasy - but unfortunately, that noticeable detachment from any of the characters featured results in a somewhat muted response (as a viewer) when they're incessantly chewed up & spat out by the gratuitous violence - that's shot in a hauntingly raw, ominous way - they're repeatedly (& needlessly) thrust in to by the callous, cowardly officers, who arrogantly orchestrate the entire miserable situation that needn't last a single day longer.Again, I suppose that only reaffirms the statement the creators are trying to make, wilfully juxtaposing intense sequences of suffering & pain with little sentimentality & ambivalence; the film chronicles how Germany treated (or more accurately, mistreated) its own people, offering up generations of its future citizens on the battlefield as sacrificial lambs, massacred at the altar of a poisonous, nationalistic ideology which had taken root within the governing population; boys - barely men, even some who weren't yet - were essentially reduced to nothing but disposable, unimportant objects, thoughtlessly discarded & simply replaced in a sadistic game & quest for absolute power (no matter the personal cost or price paid in blood) - an incalculable loss which (even by the time the armistice came in to effect) still wasn't enough to satiate the tyrannical desires of the few, controlling the many... And the movie does therefore (to its credit) accurately reflect that exact point in its portrayal of the poor cannon fodder by representing them as exactly that, & additionally lenses the apathy of the superiors (who give the indefensible orders) through a perspective of rightful, scornful contempt.Hence, I can understand the creative intentions (depicting the utter, irredeemable meaninglessness; the wanton, senseless destruction) & the grim inhumanity of it all... Yet after seeing such horrors & heinous cruelties, I guess I felt like I wanted a purpose to everything I'd sat through by the time the credits started rolling - & thought I'd been cheated by the fact that there wasn't one. On the other hand, like I acknowledge earlier, I assume that's not accidental - & rather the understandably cynical, bitter & despondent conclusion the narrative decidedly wants the audience to come to by the time it reaches its unsatisfactory denouement; there is no discernible reason that could ever hope to justify the carnage we observe - the savagery that unfolds is simply slaughter for the sheer sake of it & the trauma experienced by all those affected was utterly preventable, had the invaders put aside their vanity & pride & sought to preserve peace which could've so effortlessly been maintained.Plus, it does also show one massive miscalculation on the side of the victors; forcing the Germans in to reluctant submission & backing them in to signing an agreement with terms they couldn't accept would ultimately entrench resentful animosity that would act as a spark to light the fire of the 2nd World War, only a few decades later etc. Foreshadowing what was to come before anyone could predict the oncoming calamity. Due to this, irrespective of what I think (or more aptly, how little it evoked within me), I must concede that it remains a success, regardless - because the project undoubtedly achieved its goal in a commendably brutal & unflinching manner - & I can't plausibly surmise any alternative which would've resulted in something better.~W011y4m5 rated 9/10 on 28 October 2022"," The third version that I've seen...but I still prefer the original 1930 version.: ""Im Westen nichts Neueus"" is a recent German version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". Apparently, the German film industry thought so much of the movie that it's been submitted as German's nomination for the Best Foreign Language Film for the Oscars. Although the story is based on a book by a German ex-soldier, the previous two versions of the story were made in the States...the Oscar-winning 1930 version and a 1979 made for TV version. Of the three, the 1930 version is my favorite.The filmmakers insist that the film is not a remake but a film that is a new look at Erich Maria Remarque's novel...quite different from the previous movies. And, after seeing it, it is indeed quite different. While the leading character is the same, the story and tone are different. In this 2022 version, the story is VERY episodic and you never really feel attached or connected to the characters. Instead, it's pure terror, gore and violence...which IS quite realistic for WWI. The other versions, in contrast, focus more on the character and personality changes in the lead...with a lesser emphasis on his friends as they fight the war. They also seem to be set earlier in the war (based on the uniform helmets), whereas almost all of the 2022 film takes place the last week or so of the war. If you want a war film full of terror, realism and gore, the 2022 version is for you. The others, in my opinion, are better because they do a better job showing the destruction of the souls and personalities of the men. All are well worth seeing.As I already said, the film is gory and realistic and so I advise you to think about it before watching. Don't show it to young kids and if you've been to war, perhaps you might want to see something else.~planktonrules rated 8/10 on 20 January 2023"," Bloodbath: I just finished watching Scorsese's ""The Irishman."" I was amazed at how much blood spurting from brains and bodies from that film. This one never ends. I don't pretend to think that war is not like this. World War 1 is about as horrible as anything ever seen on this planet. The type of hand to hand combat, fighting in the trenches, mustard gas, on and on is beyond belief. In this film random combat prevails. We don't get a deep understanding of the characters. In the 1930's film, we knew Paul. We knew of his commitment and ""patriotism"" followed by his anger and disdain. The ones who are most in love with battle are those who have never tasted it. That message comes through loud and clear. The battle scenes are so graphic, but almost to a fault. The anonymity of the players makes them more a part of the setting. Of course, like most wars, the whole thing is about turf and very little turf is gained. The politicians are in charge but never see a bullet. Paul is significant as a survivor (until the end). The final battle, egged on by a zealot, is there because the Armistice still has a few hours to come to fruition. I don't recall anything like that before. Anyway, this is an impressive film, but it lacks a deeper psychological element.~Hitchcoc rated 7/10 on 6 June 2023"," Never felt war so intense before: I'm really a Film Nerd and I've watched many famous and less famous war movies, too.

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.Rating: 7.5/10 (Impressive)~ahmadz839 rated 7/10 on 2 November 2022"
