Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023) - IMDb,6.4,Thandiwe Newton|Zachary Levi|Bella Ramsey|Imelda Staunton|Lynn Ferguson|David Bradley|Jane Horrocks|Romesh Ranganathan|Daniel Mays|Josie Sedgwick-Davies|Peter Serafinowicz|Nick Mohammed|Miranda Richardson|Angela Christofilou|Rebekah Hinds,Sam Fell,Karey Kirkpatrick|John O'Farrell|Rachel Tunnard,"Having pulled off an escape from Tweedy's farm, Ginger has found a peaceful island sanctuary for the whole flock. But back on the mainland the whole of chicken-kind faces a new threat, and Ginger and her team decide to break in."," Man, I wanted to LOVE this one: Aardman Animations, personally, is a hit or miss for me as in the past, they have created some great works like Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and so forth. But at the same time, they have made some pretty mediocre or pretty bad works too. ""Chicken Run"" is one of my favorite stop-motion movies as I really like the characters, the animation, and the narrative. With this sequel coming out after many years, it was entertaining but it was a bit underwhelming.Throughout, the stop-motion animation, character models, and colors are amazing as Aardman continues to provide great clay animation. Aardman always provides some great animation and the models, colors, sound designs, and the movements are all excellent. We get to see the same characters from the previous movie and it was fun to see them communicate, move around and observe their actions throughout. The voice performances from the cast members were solid as they provided some good voice works, although a few voice performances weren't great. The soundtrack is pretty good and there are some decent humor moments that I chuckled at.With the narrative continuing from the previous movie, the narrative explores some new concepts and territories within the setting and characters and there are some aspects that were interesting but some not so much. Certain new concepts that were explored I felt weren't strong enough and at times, it really feels like a rehash of the first movie. On the characters, there are new characters that are introduced but unfortunately, none of the new characters weren't really interesting since they felt a bit dull and kind of annoying at times. Because this is a new cast, I personally felt while the original characters are still fun, the chemistry and energy of what made them fun from the first movie felt a bit lacking. The soundtrack is okay and there are some solid dialogue moments while being a bit clunky.Despite my gripes, I still was interested to see where the movie goes and for what it is, it's a decent sequel. Overall, it is entertaining and it's nice to see the characters again, but I wish it could have been better.~chenp-54708 rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Not worth the wait.: There are some prequels or sequels that no one asked for, but end up being happy that they happened anyway.This sadly isn't one one of them.I was already upset by the fact that many of the core voice actors were being replaced. Mel Gibson I could understand for obvious reasons, but the excuse for Julie Sawalha's exclusion was not acceptable. I do believe the real reason was because Sawalha is no longer famous, while Thandi (or Thandiwe) Newton, her replacement, is a big name in the industry. This is a growing trend in modern animation where famous actors are favoured to voice cartoon characters rather than actual voice actors.At one point Ginger fearfully says ""that voice!"" before the reveal of the return of Mrs Tweedy. It would have been extremely awkward if Miranda Richardson was no longer voicing the villain.The story itself is a little too similar to the first Chicken Run and the animation looks too shiny and CGIed, despite most of it being clay-animation. The stakes were not really as high, and the characters were not as fleshed out as they were in the first film.My favourite character is still Fowler, as he was still hilarious. And unlike the new voices for the other main characters, David Bradley does a great job here.The humour in the first film was intelligent and witty. But despite most of the film still being proudly British (even including a chicken character with a Scouse accent), the magic and the passion found in the first film has dampened down quite a lot here.Kids will no doubt enjoy it. But after 23 years, I wasn't all that impressed.~Avwillfan89 rated 6/10 on 18 December 2023"," A decent sequel: For me, this sequel was a decent continuation of the original. It was based on the same concept as the original with some minor additions.The story was simple and light hearted just like the original, the screenplay was decent, the direction was decent, the animation was unique like the original and the voice actors did a good job. The thrill elements were embedded nicely in the story which makes this normal story little bit enjoyable.But to be honest, I think this sequel was unnecessary as it was underwhelming if we compare it to the original. Overall, this movie was a decent entertainer.~akshatmahajan rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Same Mistakes as Early Man: Looks like the creators didn't learn anything from the failure of Early Man (2018). A successful family animation needs to engage folks of any and all ages - the first Chicken Run did to a good extent. This one didn't. Ditto Early Man.Audiences want to see relatable settings, characters with soul, plots that are realistically challenging (not pointlessly ridiculous). So we end up with a colourful bland bright happy island commune ... overdone, unrelatable and boring. Then we get a silly super high tech robots and gadgets filled chicken farm/factory - huh? And football matches in prehistoric Early Man? Huh?From the short documentary on 'the making of' its immediately clear the creators and team spent a massive 99% effort on the puppeting, the sets, the lighting, the movements, the look of things - which is fine, except, where's the effort on the story, the characters, the soul of the whole thing??The director even laughed at how fun it was to give Ms Tweedy a glam look - but hello mister - did you ask yourself what the viewers want out of a once iconic scary evil character like her? A glam up look? Really?It does seem all the people involved in this - many very competent in their area of specialty - was more focused on putting out their best on producing their area of specialty than making an animated movie that truly relates to the audience.For instance so much technical deal and effort was made of Tweedy walking down glass steps - if the story and plotting was better it wouldn't have mattered if she was walking down milk carton cutouts with average lighting and a less smooth gait.Do please spend more thought and effort on plotting and characters and audience impact, and less on the visual razzle dazzle.~charles-limcw rated 5/10 on 20 December 2023"," No charm, feels corporate?: Say what you want about the man but Mel Gibson is sorely missed, that was one of many mistakes this movie made. Flat, boring, pretty, but not fun. The original stands as a childhood favorite that I've watched with my kid many times but nugget of whatever, will be forgotten in a week. Yet another in a long list of agenda filled Netflix blunders. When will they learn? (Side note about Netflix as a production company: finally canceling my subscription after ANOTHER price hike, removing Christmas movies around the holidays, while other services put them behind pay walls is just a greedy, disgusting practice imo, streaming is out of control and people are finding alternatives)~abestrat rated 4/10 on 15 December 2023"," Mission Impossible chicken style.: This sequel to 'Chicken Run' arrives after 23 years, but don't worry, being animated the returning cast haven't aged a bit! Although the story picks up where the original left off, this is an entirely new adventure and you don't really have to see the first film to follow the story, although it is highly recommended. The opening to 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget' recaps the events of the first film in a nutshell.The chickens are living happily on an island away from humans, and Ginger and Rocky starts a family. Their daughter is Molly. No sooner has she become a teenager than she becomes curious about the world and what lies on the other side of the lake. When trucks arrive and start clearing the forest, the chickens devise a plan to shelter themselves from human vision, but Molly wants to explore...and so she does.She befriends a chicken named Frizzle, and together the head to Fun-Land Farms where they believe chickens to live happy lives, according to an advert they saw. Off course the farms are not what it seems, and they soon get into trouble.It's up to Ginger, Rocky and some of their friends to save them. Last time they broke out of a chicken farm; this time they're breaking in. A familiar antagonist from the first film returns, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.I enjoyed the stop-motion animation, the characters, their adventures, and the humour. This is a delightful film young and old can enjoy. The film also illustrates how the younger generation are not always appreciative of what their parents went through to ensure their survival, and I don't think youngsters watching this will fully understand. These are lessons a mature audience will relate to.As much as I enjoyed 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget', I enjoyed 'Chicken Run' more, because it was simpler and funnier.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," Human chickens or chicken humans?: I was keen to see this movie, as I loved the original Chicken Run.It's a long time since the first movie, so naturally the voice actors have changed. This was OK, except I thought Thandiwe Newton sounded a bit too "" posh"" to play Ginger. I got used to it (love Thandiwe!), but I did miss Julia Sawalha and I think the original had a better cast.The main problem for me was the way the chickens are now portrayed. In the first movie, they were hens living at a poultry farm, having to lay a certain number of eggs each day, or risk getting topped by the farmer's wife. So they were basically chickens living like chickens. What made it amusing, of course, was the hens' human qualities, and the fact that whole thing ran like the satirisation of a prisoner-of-war escape movie.However in the sequel, all pretence at ""chicken life"" has gone; the chickens live exactly like humans, and are in effect just humans who look like chickens. Egg laying is a rare event; it's all farming and building and lounging in deck chairs sipping drinks. The spivvy rats with their dodgy goods are now lovable. And to make matters worse, Rocky and Ginger have a ghastly brat of a kid called Molly.As the plot of this movie is also pretty weak, I found it hard to get involved. God forgive me, I was dying for Molly to get turned into a chicken nugget.Didn't work for me. I find it hard to care about chickens who have turned into humans.~KittyG26 rated 2/10 on 16 December 2023"," Nowhere near as good as the original but still really good: Diminishing returns are in full effect with Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, a harmless film that's filled with good messages about parenting even if they've all been done before. It's only sporadically funny but it gets away with it thanks to its stop motion claymation which is increasingly rare to see and just a gift to have.Recasting Mel Gibson makes sense and replacing Julia Sawalha really doesn't. That being said Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi do a good job of making the swap as seamless as possible. Bella Ramsey's Molly is a welcome addition with the ideal amount of childlike wonder and yearning for more in life.Sam Fell's direction gets so much mileage out of the claymation. This form of animation requires so much care and patience which makes everything better. The only slight issue is how clean everything is. Generally it's just really vibrant and clearly very polished which feels like it comes at the cost of losing the original's style.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," Insincere and forced: The stop motion is always on point. Impressive, when you think about how much time goes into it.If you work really hard, you can probably scrape together some respect for the production, but that might be the only feeling you can evoke. The voice acting isn't great, and not just because the original actors are missing. There's a strange disconnect between the animation and the acting, it feels insincere and forced.The story is nothing new, and it should have been. It should have broke new ground just as the original did. It really feels like they put no effort into creating an original plot and just clung to the coat tales of the first film. Seems like a bad choice.I want to write something positive about it but I don't really know what that could be. I guess Bella Ramsey was good casting. I'm only giving it 5 stars because I appreciate the time it takes to make stop motion.~neomastanford rated 5/10 on 15 December 2023"," Yikes this is bad: I don't know what to say, I've been looking forward to this for ages and after watching it, Wow!The voice acting is awful, they've changed some of the original actors and they're not even close, it's jarring, whoever voices Ginger is awful, talk about phoning in a performance and Rocky sounds like a completely different character.The animation looks like made for TV stuff, really cheap and devoid of the originals charm, the story is okay and will no doubt keep kids occupied but for adults, there's nothing here where as the first one had loads of adult humour.This is far from the worst thing I've seen but Wow is it a massive step down from the original, really disappointing. Still good to see Mrs Tweedy return though so that's at least one plus.~phantasmda rated 3/10 on 15 December 2023"

I honestly took a step back when I first saw this. I am ALWAYS extremely critical of movies lately, especially since recently Illumination, Disney, and even a recent Dreamworks movie have fallen flat, but wow!This is truly a family film that is appealing to ALL audiences. Kids have laughs at gags, adults have entertainment from parenting and general themes, and they even poke fun at grandparents, who still are made out to be cool and fun-loving by the end.From both a filmmaker and huge movie fan's perspective, it is extremely refreshing to see a kids movie have good values, no explicit themes, and still be very entertaining! The story and plot was well worked out and everything made sense. The music was fantastic (a solid original score, no spammed pop music like most kids movies). The animation was adorable and very enjoyable to watch. It was also super refreshing to see new/underground talents showcased! A lot of less known names but a fantastic job done (especially the voice actors)!I'm really impressed and wish to express from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making such a great family film, creating a safe space for families to enjoy a movie without oversexualized themed, over the top toilet humor, extreme violence, etc. 9/10!!!~joe_jr rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," A production that makes the most of its potential and successfully achieves a story of family unity and dignity.: ""Migration"" is an excellent animated film whose script tells a story with familiar and educational touches, setting an example of dignity towards immigrants, all from the perspective of the ducks. The animation is tremendous, resulting in beautiful visuals, as well as amazing character design. The voice work of the actors is perfect, giving charisma to their characters and highlighting their personalities. The editing work is highly successful and intensifies the drama and comedy when they are required on screen. A production that makes the most of its potential and successfully achieves a story of family unity and dignity.~jp_91 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," Lots of family fun, sit back and enjoy: This has to be one of the better kids animations of the year or even a few years. It isn't pretentious and doesn't bang on the drum of morality. Rather its pure fun and hijinks.It starts off with the dad trying to scare the kids out of ever wanting to leave the pond, but in a very fun and funny opening. All is good for over protective dad until some exotic ducks land for a stop on their migratory flight south and fill the kids and mum with ideas about migrating to Jamaca. Dad tries to stop but is convinced to overcome his fears and take a chance.And that is the only moral part of the story, take a chance in life and face your fears and prejudices.From there on it's one rollercoaster of aride with lots of fun bits.Also, unlike a lot of animations, you aren't playing the game of oh that is such and such voice. The only really recognisable voice is Danny Divitto, who is perfectly cast as grumpy uncle Dan. The kids are relative unknowns but are perfect in timing and emotion.The animation is colourful but doesn't overwhelm the film either like some animation do.It also isn't overly long which is great and kids will love it and parents get lots of laughs.Yes it's not ground breaking but that's not the point.A perfect family fare, perfect for Christmas/ holidays.~reeceagland rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Migration"": A Heartwarming Animated Adventure Packed with Laughter and Life Lessons: I couldn't resist the chance to watch ""Migration"" ahead of its Boxing Day release date. From start to finish, my love for ""Migration"" only grew stronger. The film is an absolute delight - it's not just super cute and funny, but it's also packed with heartwarming moments that tug at your emotions. The characters bring such warmth and charm that you can't help but be drawn into their world.Beyond the humor and cuteness, ""Migration"" delivers a great message to stop waiting for life to happen to you. The animation is nothing short of fantastic, bringing the story to life with vibrant visuals and captivating sequences. ""Migration"" is a perfect blend of laughter, heart, and visual brilliance that makes it a must-watch for animation enthusiasts of all ages.~cutie7 rated 7/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not Half Bad: Overall, not a half bad illumination movie.The movie's environments were beautiful. Easily my favorite part of the movie. I loved the watercolor-esque trees. Also, the designs of some of the humans, especially the main antagonist, are pretty nice and creative. The jokes weren't nearly as ""cringey"", and landed for the most part. (hah, get it, cause the movies about ducks... migrating). The humor in this movie feels more family-focused, rather than purely for the kids.As for the negatives, the story is fairly linear, and not too interesting. The overall theme is very obvious, so it isn't too deep. All in all, a typical illumination movie.Overall, a decent Illumination movie. Just plain family fun. If you want to be fairly entertained, and laugh with your kiddos, this is a good movie.~OddityReviewsStuff rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre: I recently watched the movie Migration (2023) in theaters with my daughter. The storyline follows a northeastern family of ducks 🦆 who encounter a flock of migrating birds that invite them to fly south for the winter. Despite their usual winter stay, the family convinces the dad to fly to Jamaica 🇯🇲 this year, and an adventure ensues.This movie is co-directed by Benjamin Renner (Ernest & Celestine) and Guylo Homsy (Eddie's Life Coach) and features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Danny DeVito (Twins), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians), Keegan-Michael Key (Wonka), and Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games).The animation in this picture is outstanding, while the rest of the film is fairly average. The storyline is straightforward, with a few worthwhile subplots. I particularly enjoyed the husband and wife working together through various circumstances for the betterment of the family. The voices are well selected, and Awkwafina and DeVito comedic content keep the film well-paced. The conclusion is as expected, though its sequel potential remains uncertain.In conclusion, Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 December 2023"," Great for adults and kids - clean and entertaining family film: The animation is colorful, action starts relatively early and is well spaced-out. The jokes were appropriate. My kids are aged 10 and 14, they both enjoyed it. There were kids of all ages in the theatre and I could hear laughs all the time. Perfect for the holidays and also has a great soundtrack.The storyline is obvious in the title, but the journey was full of surprises enough to keep you on the edge. There were useful lessons to be learned and a morale to the story.The last film I had seen at the cinema was Super Mario and ""Migration"" has delivered the same clean family entertainment that we have been missing.Highly recommended.~m_al_saeed rated 10/10 on 16 December 2023"," Suprisingly decent: I went with low expectations about this film because the trailers looked like the movie wasn't good, but after watching it i can say it's really worth the ticket.Visually there's nothing to complain about here the ducks and all kinds of birds that appear here look nice and are really expresive.Soundwise nothing outstanding, decent, you can hear every character clearly because all was mixed well. The ambient for all scenarios is done pretty well too (Swamps, cities, forrest)Storywise This is what i liked the most because it's not that dumb for an illumination movie, it has drama and funny moments throughout the entire run, but nothing too deep, just enough to be entertaining.I would say if you go alone or with your family you'll have a good time.~mackarron rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Migrate To This One With Your Flock! Capital Fun That Just Needed A Bit More: LIKES:Good Pace-The movie doesn't get lost in sitting around and stewing on the adventure, but rather gets the world established and ready to leap into the adventure within about 15 minutes-Once they take off, the movie keeps to a good pace that is fun, well-timed, and never getting too stuck in one place that it becomes too boring or off-putting of the story-And yet, the movie doesn't do the Fast and Furious approach of putting the petal to the metal and flooring through it to cram jokes.-Instead it does a nice job of giving that adventure nature and still respecting the character development and plot to help make this a movie that is far above the Nick Jr. And Disney Jr. Elements.Fantastic Animation-It might not be the highest grade in terms of realism, but Animation still shows how other studios than Disney can make cartoons come to life.-Ducks fly and soar in the style that mimics the natural movements of the ducks and other birds, in their steps, dives, and swoops. It's great attention to detail and part of the magic that animators make.-then comes the human elements in their forms, and what a surprise to see such great adaptations in the small fowl forms is humorous , charming, and just cute at times and brings the energy that this movie thrives on.-Wrap this all together and the smoothness of the animation is going to easily keep your eyes on the festivities of this dynasty in their migration to whatever they are searching for in their journey.-And the design with that goofy look on their faces that Illumination does adds more than takes away, sort of a subtle level that adds funny with little effort.Great Humor-A staple to these movies for me is to laugh and hope that I get more than just kid humor and cute sound effects and one liners.-Migration had my back and did not disappoint with the material presented and more so how appropriate it sticks to the rating they gave it.-Yes, there are plenty of the tropes for kids, silly smashing, lots of random lines, and annoying sounds that are going to be repeated.-Yet, the movie feels a bit like Bluey, actually geared towards adults with plenty of their perspective to help color this film in a shade that was far more enjoyable-Bed time stories gone wrong to help make a point, sarcasm that just sticks and matches the emotion so well that the combination of visual and sound are unbeatable for me.-And there are even a few jokes hidden within that for you to enjoy and find, that little extra sauce that makes this movie fun for all.-It's also balanced and well implemented, never getting to lost to overshadow everything else this movie achieves, again a part of the fun, not the whole fun that still gives an engaging story.The Opening Short:-It's of course geared to the Despicable Me audience, but the small tale and short is very fun and a little side story that curbs you to the Gruniverse.-I enjoyed the simple tale that bridges the gap, adds that silly level of humor found in that movie franchises, and was a nice bridge to warm us up.-One character is a surprise to see, but with them comes a funny Looney Tunes like motion that was very enjoyable, if not a tad long.Family Friendly, But Adult-This movie again can mirror the craze of Bluey in my eyes.-It's family friendly, easily watchable by all ages, but yet not so juvenile that older adults are going to be looking at their phones or fingernails to entertain themselves.-That humor I mentioned is one element, but the fact there are such great storytelling elements and character development really help make this movie easily more entertaining and relevant to the masses.-To have that balance helps really give the movie rewatchability to see what else you can find with the wit and cleverness of the animators' imaginations.Good Character Usage-And again, a good movie is loaded with engaging characters, and even more so using those characters to justify their inclusion is big for a reviewer like me.-Migration again succeeds in this task, granting you characters that are colorful in look and design, but also in personality and story.-The main flock is of course the stars, but surprisingly there is a lot of secondary characters that get some fantastic screen time, with a purpose and engagement that just doesn't tag them along for the ride.-The antagonist might not say much, but it doesn't matter, because even he has enough merit into his inclusion, and enough menace to fit in without being too much.-It's impressive to see them do this where others struggle, but applause for what hey crammed into about a 90 minute run time.Voice Acting-The crown jewel for me is the voices that brought so many characters to life and delivered that comedic punch with the haymaker that had me laughing.-The writing might be good, but I loved the execution as well, with just about everyone delivering solid performance.-DeVito needs more lines, but what he pulls off is perfect for the curmudgeon duck, with just that touch of dry sarcasm and lack of energy that is balanced so well.-Banks was that calming factor, her raspy and controlling voice a nice contrast to help calm the theatrics of the comical birds in this movie, and add that touch of different humor to the mi to help keep things diverse.-However, it is Nanjiani that was the best. His voice was made for an animated dock, so aggressive, high pitched, raspy, and that element of awkward composure that makes the humor so fun. And yet, still has the air of caring that leads to a great character that I enjoyed watching across the board.DISLIKES:More Needed-The adventure was great, but again, there seemed to be more needed to finish this migration to the South.-This film did the trick on many levels, but at the end of the movie, the adventure seemed to end a little faster and quicker than I expected.-Surely more things could have been done, or maybe not skip quite as much and lead to three minute montage to get home, especially given one last fun thing that could have been that last touch.-Throw in some of the other characters getting a little more development given the trauma they faced and well... I kind of would have liked to see that execution.-Minor to some, and moderate to others, a little more engaging design, even at the cost of the short, could have helped take this a bit further.Gwen Gets A Tad annoying-She might be the most adorable character, but it doesn't mean that she was my favorite.-Gwen's whininess at times is cute, but often is annoying to me, the high squeals, the excessive jokes of embarrassment, and the impatience just grating my nerves.-Her humor is definitely more like a kid focus approach and at times it works, but it was much lost on me and she gets a tad overwhelming for someone like me who just doesn't enjoy bratty kids.More Character Development-It started so well and I think that the movie kept most of this up, but... again there was still some elements that needed tinkering.-Some more challenges and merit to take the ducks to a new level and help them not have such an abrupt change.-In this type of movie, it's not quite as important to the key demographic, but with just that touch more story building could have taken this to the level of some of my favorite movies.The VERDICT:I really enjoyed my time with Migration, and found this animated feature to be quite engaging for me and many of the members in my showing. The animation is solid, cartoony and goofy, which works to capitalize on the writing and humor loaded into this journey. With that balance of adult and kid, the movie caters to all ages and should assist with making a movie that should keep the attention for the 90 minutes. A sensational voice cast and lots of time with the characters, only further brings out the fun and I really just had a fun time soaring through the skies through this quirky little family. Sure, more development could have helped add that added spice, and there could have been a few more engaging challenges and less Gwen. Yet, the movie still shines as an entertaining piece and I encourage this one in theaters for a fun outing, or at the least a watch at home.My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0.~rgkarim rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," Cute but trite: Been there, seen it.

I read the negative postings on every film I see, and it's amazing to me how much energy people put into picking apart what's intended to be a holiday entertainment. Especially these days with the advance in computer generated effects. There used to be a time when clay-mation was the rage, and how realistic was that? How about considering the message - I for one would be darned upset if there was no more magic left in the world. It's evident every time my little two year old granddaughter runs in the room and tells her gaga (that would be me), to 'sit' so we could play or watch a movie like this together. This one got around to showing 'Santy', and you have to marvel when a mere child sits enthralled by the spectacle of color and motion the way it's presented here. For a while during my adult life, there was probably a time when I didn't hear that bell, but as I get older the sound is coming back, even as my hearing diminishes. I guess you'd call it the magic of kids and Christmas together, and you can count me in when the conductor calls 'All Aboard'.~classicsoncall rated 7/10 on 19 December 2010"," Enchantment, thrills, spectacle...looks great on DVD...: On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, ""The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,"" we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely ""get it"".Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job.~Doylenf rated 9/10 on 22 November 2004"," Will Become A Christmas Classic: I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.I had reservations about the use of CGI animation since I felt it really only worked for stories about cute animals but having seen the film, the CGI was the best way to capture the spirit of the film. It really wouldn't have worked as well in live action, the sense of other-worldly magic would have been lost. And as it was, the artwork was beautiful, especially the snowy mountainous scenery that the train passes through.This film took me back to my childhood and that tingly-feeling every child gets on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa's visit. The story was sweet and innocent without being nauseating, and I think every one of us can empathise with the boy who wants to believe in Santa but is growing away from the innocence of early childhood and faith in magic. Much like Raymond Briggs' 'The Snowman', I predict 'The Polar Express' will go down as a Christmas classic. It certainly makes a pleasant change that this year's Christmas film was actually about Christmas and I hope they make the re-release of this film an annual Christmas event.~cosmic_quest rated 9/10 on 20 December 2004"," It is a very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable: Directed by veteran Robert Zemeckis, It is a production that unveils, throughout its 100 minutes, the story of an American boy in the late 1950s. By witnessing the polar express stop at his door, the young man will have the most fantastic experience of his life. Life, something that will mark him forever and allow his belief in Christmas, not as firm as one would expect for a child, to become even more solid. Initially reticent, the young man agrees to leave on the train that takes him on a tour full of incredible adventures. Each piece of territory crossed is a different learning experience, marked by its still incipient trajectory. He fights with Scrooge, the famous evil Christmas spirit, immortalized by the literature of Charles Dickens, passes by the famous Polar Aurora, a place with the optical phenomenon due to the brightness observed in the night skies of the polar regions, due to the impact of particles of solar wind with the high atmosphere of the earth, channeled by the magnetic field of our planet, that is, an impressive visual spectacle that leaves no one indifferent.In the face of conflicts, as it is worth mentioning, the boy no longer believes in Santa Claus, the narrative becomes an allegory for the need to believe and invest in the ""so"" Christmas spirit. We check with some resistance, because the foot in reality does not allow us to surrender too much to the utopias proposed by the American cinematographic discourse. However, one of the ""tasks"" of art is precisely to allow us to clarify reality through fictional proposals, thus, the ticket to enter the world of Zemecks film is ""bought"" by all those who indulge in the charms of art. Narrative that unfolds before our eyes, a set of scenes built using visually incredible resources.Zemeckis's filmography is known for playing with the ludic, and here it is no different. The script to be well digested by the viewer needs to be seen as a story about magic and aborted beliefs. Alan Silvestri's music helps to punctuate this feeling that life in the eyes of a child is more beautiful, even if that child no longer believes in legendary figures, as is the case with the central character. In ""The Polar Express"" we have a short, simple and objective plot. The director's intention was never to create a work of art in the plot with this film, but to prove that you can rescue barbaric feelings and emotions with the Christmas theme. Now imagine Tom Hanks facing five different roles in the same film. Imagine? Something very crazy to think about, mainly because the ""motion capture"" technique (technique used to make the character Gollum from the series ""The Lord of the Rings, for example) was used, which captured all of Hanks' movements and transferred them to the computer, mixing reality and animation, fantasy and flesh and blood beings. The actor plays a boy who does not believe in the Christmas spirit, his father, a locomotive driver, a stroller and Santa Claus himself. It is a versatility never seen in the world of movie theaters.This technique was used in a magnificent way for the sake of narrative. To get an idea of what was done, all the actors in the film acted in front of an empty screen, with motion capture sensors attached throughout their bodies. The data from these sensors were passed on to computers and served as a template for the creation of the character in the film itself. As these sensors were responsible for capturing movements and facial expressions, the actors did not necessarily have to have the same body as the character. This allowed Hanks to play five different characters. And look, it was not easy to shape all of his expressions, so much so that the work lasted almost a year. The interesting thing was to see Steven Tyler, vocalist of the band Aerosmith, as Elf singing a song at the end of the film. Very funny! They managed to capture the essence of their appearance (big mouth and ears)!The film makes use of a very new advent for its time, and at least the main character is very excited. Already adults and peripheral child characters are astonishing to look at. This is thanks to the concept of Uncanny Valley, which preaches that figures that imitate human beings when they approach what man is become strange. The dialogues and interactions are quite artificial, but not as much as the attempts to make musical numbers. The waiters who serve the wagons are so tough that they look like imitations of androids. This issue is somewhat appeased by the parties involving animals running, flying and interacting with the typical things in the scenarios. Wolves and eagles represent more than just animals typical of North American fauna, and result in representatives of the work's sense of adventure. The criticisms received at the time of the launch, stoning the flesh-and-bone characters, their lackluster movement, their rubberized look and their glazed eyes, forgot the most important component of any short story: simplicity and narrative poetry.And although the visual is the only really negative point of this technique, like ignoring the perfection of Zemeckis's camera, it went through, following in the smallest details the movement of a lost golden ticket and the travellings that lead us nimbly in and out of the train, especially during the free fall on the tracks and crossing the thin ice? The option for elegant frames also stands out, and the counter-plongée, which accompanies the little boy's belief through the frozen floor, not only dignifies the moment but anticipates the arrival of Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the photograph by Don Burgess and Robert Presley is breathtaking - as shown in the image below -, and the intense gold of the train ticket or the lighting of the bonfire on the face of a Beggar, the angel presents in the vast majority of people. Christmas stories, is enough to make a beautiful Christmas story shine.At the end of the projection, we were left with the feeling that Zemeckis achieved his goal, of combining technology and magic in the same product. He, who is admittedly one of the directors who most seek to develop and perfect techniques and technologies, ends up creating a plastically flawless film, transposing to the screen with admirable perfection the engravings from Allsburg's book. Zemeckis also creates practically unimaginable plans and sequences, in a brutal effort to want to innovate. Zemeckis also loves to make references to other films. This time, he made the children's classic ""The Fantastic Chocolate Factory"", starring Gene Wilder. The ticket that gives access to the train is golden, just like in the classic movie. In addition to similarities like the big chocolate factory, the gift factory or even the driver with the funny Willy Wonka.Assuming a metalinguistic tone on purpose - the Conductor, one of the characters voiced by Tom Hanks, refers sensibly to abandoned toys - and accidentally - Ebenzer Scrooge's puppet would serve as a mold some years later for the personification of the classic character by Jim Carey, O Polar Express culminates in the detail plan of a hand bell, which is much more than the complete proof of the fantastic journey, it is the true Christmas spirit within each one of us. The inner child who screams and cries out for the sincere remembrance of his attachment to the beautiful illusion of the good old man, of the communion of gifts and brotherly love, whose sound materializes in the tinkling of the bell at the ear of the, now adult, little boy.On the other hand, it is noticeable that the biggest problem of The Polar Express is not so much its innovative and uncomfortable aspect - something crucial for a Christmas plot - and its plot, common and obvious. The protagonist is a boy who is starting to stop believing in Santa Claus. He is growing up, and with that, forgetting the magic of childhood. The events in The Polar Express take place in a very traditional and unoriginal way. There are not many news or discoveries: everything goes very smoothly, without scares or surprises. The few moments of suspense and tension soon dissipate, and normality then dictates the course of action again. The impression is that he devoted a lot of time to the appearance of the film and very little to the development of the script.The film itself looks more like a roller coaster. You will have fun watching the ups and downs of the trip, with exciting moments and action sequences where the beauty of the most magical time of the year is paramount, while others are strange and out of place, like the setting of children singing songs. At least when the final season arrives, the home of Santa Claus, the magical character is rescued with a sequence of events that show the intimacy of the elven officials, including the architecture of miniature houses since they are small. There comes a moment in the film that is surreal to imagine that a boy can walk on top of a moving train, but it does not bother you because you are already involved in the fantasy atmosphere provided by the characters.The care with the visuals of sets and costumes of the inhabitants of the magical place breaks the skepticism of the central character of The Polar Express too much, and this is certainly a film that has a lot of audacity, being a pioneer in many points that would become quite common in children's productions. And adults later on. The movement capture technique, new at the time, brings to the film the combination of ""real images"" and animation, in one of the most surprising Christmas cinematic experiences in the history of cinema. In addition, The Polar Express is a very, very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable. Still, it is a beautiful production about friendship and how we should, without being too deluded, cultivate our dreams, with a view to making our existence more bearable.~fernandoschiavi rated 7/10 on 20 May 2021"," What's with all the hate for this movie?: This is one of the better Christmas movies I've ever watched. It's fantastic. I watched this again after ages and right after 'A boy called Christmas' which I didn't like at all. You could say that I watched this to cleanse my eyes because that movie is quite bad.It's an amazing fantasy Christmas movie with spectacular animation. Tom Hanks' animated character looks just like him. I didn't find the other characters as jarring as people claim them to be. The film's animation is so good that it's easy to overlook the ""creepy"" looking characters.The film has extremely breathtaking visuals, gripping scenes, a jolly atmosphere. It also has songs which is really fantastic and something that happens to be missing from Christmas films including'A boy called Christmas'. The moral that this movie has is also quite beautiful. So overall a really great movie to watch during Christmas. All this hate is just not justified.~eldreddsouza rated 8/10 on 12 December 2021"," My childhood: When I was a kid I watched this like, a million times. My native language wasn't english, so despite being a child not understanding anything, I loved the movie. It's full of christmas and spirit. I would want a train like that go by my home~xuanbacht rated 10/10 on 22 January 2019"," It Just Keeps Getting Better: ""Wow!"" I found myself saying this over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. It continually amazes me how far computer animation has come in the last decade. Each time I think I've seen the most beautiful or amazing artwork, something better - like this - comes along. I couldn't believe how good this looked on my flat-screen TV. I can't imagine how good it must appear on an expensive plasma television.The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene. The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling. Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem.The only drawback I found were the kids in the story. Most of them were not anyone you could really warm up to, except for the girl and she was so overtly politically correct it was sickening and an insult to anyone's intelligence. A black girl was NOT in the book but the typically-Liberal filmmakers not only change that character but make her the only one in the film with absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's so sweet she makes Mother Teresa sound like The Grinch. None of the kids in the film, however, were brats or annoying. The only funny kid was the nerd, of course. PC baloney aside, this was fabulous entertainment. Tom Hanks did a great job voicing over five characters and I've just simply never a better-looking film than this.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 29 November 2005"," Just get real folks: Come on, guys. This film was made at a time when these visuals were still groundbreaking. Don't complain now that they were not as far along then as they are today. Thanks to pioneering work like The Polar Express, filmmakers can now create even more beautiful things. A lack of historical perspective is a major shortcoming for the contemporary viewer... And yes, it is always a joy to watch Tom Hanks, whichever movie he's in. Now and back then.~tin-whistle rated 7/10 on 5 January 2022"," wonderful holiday film: So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful ""The Grinch"". Having grown up with the book ""The Polar Express"" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for ""Polar Express"" to be a complete wreck. But instead It soared. Completely. What makes the film such a success is not so much even the story itself, but an execution which somehow manages to inject every frame of the film with a feeling of childlike wonder and exuberance. In addition, there are so many clever touches and details added throughout that a feeling of mystery and excitement just fills the viewer. Among these are the waiters dancing and singing while serving hot chocolate to the kids on the train (a very funny scene, as well), the factory where the presents are prepared, and a ghost-like hobo who is never really explained, but is incredibly crucial to the feel of the film. At one point, three of the children wander lost through the empty streets of Santa's North Pole town. As they wander, various old Christmas recordings are heard playing on phonographs throughout the town. The music provides a pleasant and nostalgic ambiance to the scene. It's touches like this that absolutely make the film.I'll never understand why films seem to be required to be at least 90 minutes long. I would pay money to see a 40-minute film, as long as it were good. And even if it sucked, I would have at least wasted less time. What I'm getting at is I have no idea why a 32-page picture book needed to be a 99-minute movie. What this means is that the original story is VASTLY expanded upon. However, what is added in actually fits quite well with the essence and spirit of the book. Some of it is just sheer entertainment; the train track is like a roller coaster, characters ski on top of the cars, danger lurks around every step of the journey to the North Pole (but admittedly fun danger). Other aspects further illuminate and expand upon the book's basic theme of the virtue of belief in the implausible. So I have no idea why this was made into a full-length, but in the end, I'm glad it was. It didn't even feel too long (and I think everything is too long).Much criticism has fallen on the look of the characters in the movie. I can agree to a point. While there is incredible visual detail in the faces, they usually seem void of expression. In general, a lot of the motion seems rather wooden, as well. The scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous. Overall, the minor problems in animation (which really boil down to a matter of taste anyway) are certainly not enough to diminish what is an overwhelmingly successful movie. Score: 8/10~madpenguin41 rated 8/10 on 18 December 2004"," Classic Christmas Film!: Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me.~Sylviastel rated 10/10 on 18 January 2007"

There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning. A semi-autobiographical fantasy from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki."," The Fifth Stage Of Grieving: It's the Second World War, and Mahito's mother has died in a fire bombing. Now his father has announced they are moving to the country where he has set up a factory for fighter planes, and Natsuko is going to be his new mother and she's expecting a child. And, oh yeah, it gradually becomes clear she's Mahito's mother's sister. The maternal estate is large and beautifully landscaped, and there's a strange tower that has been allowed to fall to pieces, along with a family legend about a great-uncle who built the tower where a meteorite struck, and who later vanished.Mahito is upset about all this, and so he injures himself so he won't have to go to school. But he keeps having strange dreams about the grey heron and the tower, and his stepmother driving it off with a bow and arrow..... which he later spots in her room.And all the elderly female servants look like the characters from SPIRITED AWAY. This is all right, because Hayao Miyazaki has come out of retirement again to offer us a parable about how you can have a family, if you're willing to be accepting. Once again, it's filled with giant, evil parakeets, toy balloon animals that float to the moon, and a sense that there are rules in operation here, even if you don't understand them. In the meantime, enjoy the weirdness, and, as always, the magnificent background art.~boblipton rated 8/10 on 3 December 2023"," It's confused, but it got the spirit: Seeing The Boy and The Heron, Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie feels almost like a monumental event in and of itself. It was announced almost as a surprise with the words ""Hayao Miyazaki's last movie"". With this amount of hype, including the amazing reviews it's got from critics, my hype was built up to the max. The end result? Not what I expected, and that's ok!Let's get to the positives, the animation is STUNNING. The way Hayao Miyazaki manages to build these worlds and characters is just an amazing feat, they all come alive with the colours and the movement. Another positive is the tone of the movie, I really hate Disney for trying to market this as a kid's movie, when it's not. It's got some unnerving and scary moments and themes that are not suited for kids, which is good. Hayao Miyazaki is at his best when he manages to blend the adult with the fantastical.The actors are always amazing, I saw the Japanese dub so I don't know how the western VAs are doing but wow; they all do a fantastic job!Now to the negatives... a huge thing about Studio Ghibli movies in general, especially the ones from Hayao Miyazaki, is that they're always by rule driven by the characters, it's their journey that's in the front. World building and narrative always takes a second place in his movies to be able to not distract from the characters journeys, big examples of this are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle where the world building is built by very simple and effective means and rules. But here in the Boy and The Heron the world building is so convoluted and confusing it almost feels like he wanted it to take center stage in this movie and it's such a shame because it feels at like it's at odds with it's own main character who supposedly undergoes a deep deep emotional journey but it all finishes off in a very abrupt and unfitting send-off in the end which really confused me and just didn't feel like a good payoff.Also the way this movie introduces characters left and right with no rhyme or reason is super confusing. Once again, Hayao Miyazaki did this very minimally in his past movies where the characters get room to be explored and to leave an impact in the story but here once again it's at odds with its own world building- it all feels very haphazard and messy. The Heron is a fun character but I don't feel like he or Mahito do or learn anything from these adventures.Now, it may sound like I hated this movie, but I didn't. It's just that I care so much about Hayao Miyazaki movies and Studio Ghibli movies that I can't help to compare them to the movies we've seen before. And despite it not being Hayao Miyazaki's best it's still pretty good, it's very much worth a watch.~danielatala8 rated 7/10 on 25 November 2023"," Complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered: Bombs rain down on the city and in the fire, chaos, and rubble a boy, Mahito, searches for his mom. He hears her voice calling him, but he can't find her. Even when Mahito, his dad, and a new woman move to the countryside, he still hears his mom's voice calling to him from the fire. In dreams and with the encouragement of a mysterious heron, Mahito enters an abandoned and magical tower where he hopes to get clues to his mom's whereabouts. It may be an elaborate trap.This complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered film continues Miyazaki's amazing and awe-inspiring legacy. He is one of my favorite directors. In nature, wisdom about living, magic, charismatic guides (female as well as male), folklore, cute puffball critters, war/chaos, wackiness including flesh-eating parakeets, portals to other worlds, loss, and love, Miyazaki continues to run with favorite and endearing themes. The film is full of insight into what it means to be human. I was so happy to be part of the first audience to see the film outside of Japan.There is depth in the story, characters, music, voices (much better in Japanese), and especially the artwork. I'm mesmerized just by the drawings and movement of the clouds. Oh and there are fantastic and intricately drawn ocean waves, moonlight reflected on water, vivid colors, resplendent contrasts of light and dark, elaborate tree branches, night skies with resplendent stars and meteors, grasses realistically swaying in the wind, alluring shadows, and so much more. The Boy and the Heron is worth watching for the artwork alone.~Blue-Grotto rated 10/10 on 17 September 2023"," What a difference a second viewing makes!: I got the sense watching The Boy and the Heron a second time would help me like it more, but I didn't expect a second viewing to help this much. I would've ranked it maybe #8 or #9 in a Miyazaki ranking after watching it the first time, but now, I think I might honestly rank it as high as #2. The only film of his I definitely like more is Princess Mononoke (that one's a classic - little can touch it).The first time, I was overwhelmed and somewhat confused, but never bored. It's so beautiful to look at that following what was going on felt secondary. The second time around, it's still beautiful, I like the music even more, and also, I have to say, seeing it for a second time with subtitles instead of the dub helped (though the English dub was of pretty good quality, it does have to be said).I looked into how people were interpreting the film following watching it for the first time, I'll admit. I wasn't clever enough to crack the subtext, but the reading that the granduncle is a stand-in for Miyazaki, and the fantastical world represents Miyazaki's work... it's so apparent now. Having that in mind just changed the entire final half-hour for me, and though part of me feels a little slow for not ""getting"" it, I also respect the film not spelling it out, but having it there clear as day once you know that's (almost certainly) the main subtextual element.But even on an emotional level, things just clicked more this time around. Understanding how certain elements of the fantasy world lined up with reality from the start made things more moving and improved the pacing; it was less like a random stream of events, which is kind of how it felt the first time around. I appreciated the protagonist's arc more, I liked the side characters more, and I think I even found more humor (as well as more sadness) in the film the second time around.The Boy and the Heron was still really good after one watch, for the visual and musical elements alone. But the second time around, it was something else. I still think the pacing is a tiny bit slow in places, but I feel that way about every Miyazaki movie. And the ending... I do wish there'd been just something else that happened in that kind of abrupt final scene. But other than those nitpicks, this is an almost-perfect animated film.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 9/10 on 9 December 2023"," Is it bad that I just didn't get it?: I have been recently getting into Studio Ghibli films and I've been impressed. I was highly looking forward to this movie strictly because it was the first time I got the opportunity to see a Miyazaki film on the big screen. And the English dub is studded with talent.I must say... I feel let down. I almost fell asleep halfway through, and the ending didn't make sense. There was so much happening and things weren't explained. I understand that there was probably deep symbolism attached to certain writing choices, but what's the point if the viewer has no idea what they're trying to say?There were some good scenes and some good humor, but overall I feel a little empty.~poseyfan rated 6/10 on 8 December 2023"," Final curtain: I've probably started a review of a Hayao Miyazaki film stating it's his final film before, but ""The Boy and the Heron"", for more reasons than one, certainly feels like the final cut. Now aged eighty-two with an ever-increasing gap between films, it would sadly appear unlikely another feature will be made. ""The Boy and the Heron"" would show that Miyazaki now also knows the gig is up, feeling like a culmination of a life's work, looking backwards rather than forwards.Mahito's (Soma Santoki) mother is killed in a Tokyo fire, and so later goes to live in the countryside with his father and stepmother (also his aunt). His father the owner of an aeronautics factory, he has a large plot to explore, finding a mysterious old building. But he also finds himself stalked by a grey heron (Masaki Suda) who appears to mean him harm.But with his stepmother Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura) going missing, he confronts the heron and the pair go looking for her, finding themselves at the mysterious building of unknown origin. This takes them into worlds within worlds, as they are helped and hindered along the way by various people and creatures.There's a lot going on here, and, it's fair to say, too much. There are some good moments, but this is a film that gets a little lost within itself as it tries to squeeze in too much into its two hours. While there are similarities in all of his films, each has its own unique charm. ""The Boy and the Heron"", however, feels more like a greatest hits parade, with many moments reminiscent of what has come before. You can probably go through the whole film and equate moments to earlier works every step of the way.Whether intentional or not, this can show both a filmmaker struggling for original ideas, but also a messy and convoluted storyline that can become difficult to follow and disengaging. Miyazaki films can almost be made by their moments for reflection, but here you barely feel able to breath as we race into another world of new characters. The result is a film that has some of the confusion and struggles of some of Ghibli's - not just Miyazaki's - lesser works, such as ""The Cat Returns"" (2002) and ""Tales from Earthsea"" (2006).A problem for Miyazaki is that you are judging his films by such high standards, in a career that has never really declined, just become sparse. This is good, but it is by no means great; probably most reminiscent of ""How's Moving Castle"" (2005) in that it tries to open too many doors. Miyazaki is at his best when he keeps things simple, but feels like he's trying to push the magic and wonder here, rather than let it out naturally.Comedy is perhaps the strength of the film, with more outright laughs than I can remember from Miyazaki before. To start, the elderly maids of the country house, while familiar in design, have the mannerisms of excited children, hungry for treats from the big city. Though Suda as the heron is the standout, starting as a squawking threat, but becoming the buddy sidekick and a constant source of humour, as one of Miyazaki's most comical characters.As ever, Joe Hisaishi delivers a memorable soundtrack, with a sparse and simple piano a reminder that Ghibli is at its best when uncomplicated. And simplicity is the word for the somewhat abrupt ending. In a film that has so much going on, the coda is almost notable in its inactivity, and feels like a fitting way to end. A career that has brought so much, should say a quick goodbye and leave us with good memories.Politic1983.home.blog.~politic1983 rated 6/10 on 19 October 2023"," Beautiful Ghibli animation, wonderous magical worlds, moral lessons, a lot of confusion: This is one of the good ones. However it reflects as much the passion and skill of Hayao Miyazaki as his old age confusion. His latest ""last movie"" starts one way and ends (abruptly) another. It has elements from his own life, his previous work and some new ideas, but the gist of the film is reconciling with loss and moving forward, recognizing there isn't much one can do. A very old man mentality in a movie about a child entering a magical world filled with wonder and dream logic.The animation was so beautiful, the story a bit disjointed, but quite captivating. It was the ending that kind of disappointed. This film has been a long time in the making (in 2019 it was 15% complete, allegedly, with Miyazaki directing a minute of the film a month) and it shows.The Japanese title is ""How do you live?"", the same as the Genzaburo Yoshino's instructional coming-of-age novel that Miyazaki's mother gifted him. In the film, the boy finds the book with a message from his dead mother, instructing him to read it, but it never goes anywhere. There are a lot of other hints and symbols that are quite opaque to non-Japanese, so I felt that I've missed chunks of what the movie was supposed to convey.Perhaps the most interesting quality of the film is how easily it can be interpreted multiple ways, the ambiguity both confusing and thought provoking. As we experience dream and child logic we get a glimpse of the transmuted reality underneath. The grief, the loss, the benevolent yet oppressive culture, the futility and pain of war, the missing and missed parenting and so on.Bottom line: is it a masterpiece or a slice of Miyazaki, jumbled beyond recognition? Both. I felt it might be a fitting farewell film, but also that I missed so many meanings from it. I liked it.~siderite rated 8/10 on 18 December 2023"," Visual pleasing, Imaginative world, Very complex story.: If you have never watched a Hayao Miyazaki film, I wouldn't recommend starting with The Boy and the Heron.For an introduction I'd recommend to start with Spirited Away (2001) and Princess Mononoke (1997).If you become amused and the films resonate with you. Then you will enjoy The Boy and Heron. It isn't the strongest of Hayao Miyazaki and Ghibli films but a very good addition to their filmography.The film begins with a slow pace of mostly visually defining the world, characters and their dilemmas. As the movie progresses you see touches of another realm. Before you know it, it becomes a full-blown feverish dream of Hayao Miyazaki imagination and story telling. It eventually comes all together back on its feet at the end.Was it fun and visually pleasing? Yes.Was I confused at times And had a lot of unanswered question? Also yes.~sterlingrobson rated 8/10 on 10 September 2023"," Hayao Miyazaki delivers: Not his best, but a very solid fairy tale from the master with lots of his trademark elements like stoic characters, spirit worlds, flying scenes and characters running through narrow passages.It is stylistically comparable to Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle, although a bit less epic in scope. Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of ""tacked on"". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character.~alex_with_a_P rated 7/10 on 2 November 2023"," Lovely animation...and a very confusing and disjoint story.: I am a big fan of the films of Hayao Miyazaki...so much so that I went out and got a tattoo of his Totoro characters. And, I've seen and enjoyed all his films. So, when I say I didn't particularly like ""The Boy and the Heron""...well, that says a lot.The story is confusing and the ending seems, well, to kind of contradictory. I'll TRY to give a brief overview. The story is set in Japan during the later portion of WWII, though the war seems to play very little part in the story. It begins with a fire in which Mahito's mother is killed. A few years pass and Mahito and his father have moved out to the country because the father's fiancee lives there...plus, it is the war and being in a city was NOT a good thing. Mahito is shocked when a heron begins talking to him...and a weird human-like face emerges from the bill. Eventually, he and the heron enter a weird parallel world caused, apparently, by a strange meteorite and his great-great uncle. What happens next is confusing, so I'll just stop here.So many confusing story elements. Why did Mahito smash a rock against his skull early in the story? Why did the great-great uncle say he wanted Mahito's help...but then Mahito wakes up in chains! And, later, the great-great uncle says how much he likes Mahito...but what about the chains? There were more strange and inexplicable occurrances.While some might say that Miyazaki had made other confusing and difficult films, if you know about Japanese folklore and religion, films like ""Spirited Away"" make MUCH more sense. But this one is just confusing...and probably will be to Japanese audiences as well.I'm giving the film a 6 simply because the animation was nice and the film was original. But apart from that, the confusing story isn't fun, the characters aren't lovable and I think it's possibly his weakest movie.~planktonrules rated 6/10 on 5 December 2023"
The Grinch (2018) - IMDb,6.4,Benedict Cumberbatch|Cameron Seely|Rashida Jones|Pharrell Williams|Tristan O'Hare|Kenan Thompson|Sam Lavagnino|Ramone Hamilton|Angela Lansbury|Scarlett Estevez|Michael Beattie|Lori Alan|Carlos Alazraqui|Doug Burch|Cathy Cavadini|Tucker Chandler|Townsend Coleman|Meilee Condron,Yarrow Cheney|Scott Mosier,Michael LeSieur|Tommy Swerdlow|Dr. Seuss,A grumpy Grinch plots to ruin Christmas for the village of Whoville.," This film shocked me...it was good...very good.: I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.~planktonrules rated 8/10 on 24 December 2019"," Neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug: Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 6/10 on 20 November 2018"," OK, but feels unnecessary: Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.Bottom line...save your money and rent it later.~brynnharms-70885 rated 4/10 on 10 November 2018"," Excellent!: There is a reason I don't read critic reviews, and it is because I never ever agree with them. Usually when they say a movie is bad, I like it and vice versa. I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film.~AdrienneGrayceMusic rated 10/10 on 11 November 2018"," More or less EXACTLY what one would expect from Illumination's The Grinch.: Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more.~Joshua_Penczek rated 4/10 on 10 November 2018"," Very Colorful: I watched this with my grandson. Yes, I still think the original cartoon based on the book is superior. There is a simplicity that really works. The Grinch is downright mean. I love Benedict Cumberbach, but found his voice just too soothing to pull off our guy. There was too much psychological mumbo jumbo as the writers came up with an excuse for the Grinch being the way he was. Of course, it was his childhood. The movie is spectacular in its visuals. There are colorful scenes and excellent structures, making Whoville really magnificent. But the story is watered down and using Cindy Lou Who as an active character didn't work for me.~Hitchcoc rated 6/10 on 26 June 2019"," Beautiful looking and charming animated feature.: I'm going to keep this review short since you know the story most likely.I was enchanted by this movie from the moment it started. It was a fun animated movie, with gorgeous animation, a lot of heart, and even some humor. The 90 minute run-time makes the movie fly by.And the Grinch is evil but not scary. This has been ridiculed, but I like that the movie was trying to make it more comfortable for the little ones.The ending, even though I knew it was coming, was very uplifting. The Grinch's heart grew 3 times bigger, but guess what? So did mine!This is one of my favorite animated movies now, and my #1 Dr. Suess adaptation. This is the movie to see this holiday season!Note: If you found this review helpful, please click on cinephile-27690 to read my other reviews!~cinephile-27690 rated 10/10 on 11 November 2018"," The Grinch: All Rapped Up: The technicals of this version are outstanding, great, bright animation, very Pixar-ish. However, it fails in its heart which is always driven by actors' voicing and what a BIG FAIL this was - as many others have noted, so you know it's not just a few of us. First, WTH is Pharrell narrating?! Weakest voicing ever! NOTHING even approaching the dramatic storytelling of the classic's Karloff. And his hip-hop, rap interludes were simply wrong for this feature - maybe if you're setting the story in a rundown urban environment, maybe then it'd have fit, but it was totally out of place here. Then Benedict Cucumber-patch's voicing of our main Grinch character was way off base, nowhere up to the task, it was a pathetic reading of the script, the biggest letdown you could imagine. Finally, the naive, demure Cindy Lou Who from the classic is re-imagined as a hyper-active grrl power character which is also annoying and out of place. We can only hope this version is relegated to the dust bin of some Hollywood warehouse, never to be seen again.~TheTruthofItIs rated 3/10 on 13 December 2019"," Don't listen to the grinches reviewing this movie!: Anyone who gave this a bad rating clearly is just upset because, they don't like a modern Grinch because they grew up with the original classic Grinch cartoon. This movie was one of the most adorable and fun feel-good animated movies I've seen in a long time. Benedict Cumberbatch killed it as the Grinch and, all the gadgets and grandeur of the grinches holiday heist scene is so creative and colourful and fantastical! This is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time up there with Nightmare before Christmas.

But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.My theater was PACKED, and probably 75% young children, and they all seemed to have the time of their lives. Your kids will probably love it, and you will probably more than tolerate it.~benjaminskylerhill rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," Solid Example of Game to Screen Adaptation: Video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials, but on their second attempt, the Mario Bros save the day. Being on par with the likes of Sonic and Detective Pikachu, this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a Mario film. Including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise, this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out. With some interesting voice acting choices, no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world. Wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices, I was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come.~Ltufano23 rated 7/10 on 5 September 2023"," pretty much as expected: Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers. When the city's sewer goes haywire, Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame. Instead, they get sucked into an alternate world. The brothers get separated. Mario joins Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser (Jack Black). Luigi gets captured.It's brightly colored. It's energetic. It's got the characters. There's the game play. The story is fairly simple. It's pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it. The brothers could have been that, but they get separated pretty quickly. I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans. It's got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids. It's less so for everybody else.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 19 April 2023"," Everyone is so fixated on rotten tomatoes scores, it really is a solid film.: I am someone who is not swayed by ""critics"" or rotten tomato scores. I didn't even really have any expectations going into this movie. As someone who grew up playing Super Mario Bros, Super Mario World etc., I was really just going to see this movie based on nostalgia and it does deliver on nostalgia. The visuals are stunning, and while everyone has their reservations about Chris Pratt the voice acting is perfect (except one for one elderly character). While many have said this movie moves quickly or ""too fast"", I would say it has great pacing and never leaves you bored. While it is not a perfect film it leaves little to be desired. It is everything you want from an animated Super Mario Movie.~nickryan-44535 rated 8/10 on 5 April 2023", An absolute BLAST!: First off this movie is for kids and fans of Nintendo and the Mario franchise. I still think an adult who isnt a fan could still enjoy it but this movie is so full of fan service that it will have you smiling the whole time. The voice acting I was skeptical but they all work and work well too. Jack Black is the star here. I love how they kept the story simple like all of the games. Truly felt like a video game on screen. This movie felt like a beautifully animated amusement park ride. The audio in the movie was amazing too. The sounds and the score with reimagined iconic music was perfect. Some of the songs in the movie felt unnecessary but they worked. I think they should've bumped the run time to 105-120 min. 90 min felt too short as it goes by quick. I havent had this much wholesome fun at the movies in a long time. If youre a fan you HAVE to see it.~justinvitelli rated 10/10 on 5 April 2023," Critics are being too harsh for what it is: I think for what this movie sets out to do, Super Mario Bros. Movie pretty much ticks the boxes of an entertaining, reference fan-service heavy movie. A lot of the jokes are basic sure, but it's just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie. Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go. Not high art or anything, but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least. Voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought, and Jack Black was the highlight as expected. Yeah, not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is, and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it's one of the best ones easily if you ask me.6.5/10.~AdrenalinDragon rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," The Message Of Love Is Sent Directly To The Fanbase, Not To The General Audience.: This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don't think too much, it's an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.~folk_egm rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023", Chris Pratt was awesome as Mario and Jack black as bowser was remarkable!!!!!!: After meeting Chris Pratt at the Santa Barbara film festival I'm very amazed of how remarkable Chris played Mario for the first. I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game . Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this movie for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now . The Mario movie was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game . Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario . Jack black as bowser was the best for the film. His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding. Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job. He used the characters voice very carefully. The sounds were just like the video game. And i think that was absolutely awesome. The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant. Princess peach was the best part of the movie . She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle . And toad was the best part of the movie . The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome. I hope in the next Mario movie yoshi finds Mario and Luigi and becomes they're pet.~gabethedinosaur rated 10/10 on 6 April 2023," Brilliant animation and portrayal of the super Mario bros!: Took my kids for a special sky screening and boy were we excited! At first I was rather skeptical thinking this film won't do any justice to the games. However, I was wrong! This film met our expectation and beyond. I think I enjoyed this film more than my kids. From the moment the film starts it is enjoyable. Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations. As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood, this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games. A must watch film whether you have kids or not.~mj-80986 rated 10/10 on 5 April 2023"," Just average.: Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.~movies_are_life_ rated 5/10 on 10 April 2023"
Trolls Band Together (2023) - IMDb,6.0,Anna Kendrick|Justin Timberlake|Kenan Thompson|Walt Dohrn|Anderson .Paak|Ron Funches|Kunal Nayyar|David Fynn|Kevin Michael Richardson|Eric André|Daveed Diggs|Kid Cudi|Troye Sivan|Camila Cabello|Zosia Mamet|Amy Schumer|Andrew Rannells|Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Walt Dohrn|Tim Heitz,Elizabeth Tippet|Thomas Dam|Kim Caramele,"Poppy discovers that Branch was once part of the boy band 'BroZone' with his brothers, Floyd, John Dory, Spruce and Clay. When Floyd is kidnapped, Branch and Poppy embark on a journey to reunite his two other brothers and rescue Floyd."," Great fun if you let it: A cinema full of children (and parents who had to accompany their children *g*). Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film. There will probably be few judgments in between. But children will be thrilled.~MarcusCyron rated 8/10 on 15 October 2023"," Loved It!: I personally really enjoyed the movie the whole way through. It's truly amazing to watch these characters grow and develop, the soundtrack is catchy, the cast is incredible, the voice acting, too!The movie captures Branch's trauma in a special way and I really love that. They manage to make it real but in a kid-friendly way.I've been a fan of the franchise since the first movie, so getting to see how these characters became who they are and getting to see their backstories was really satisfying.Branch and Poppy's relationship really stuck out to me. I love how Poppy dealt with Branch's feelings and made sure he knew his feelings were valid.Very very well done dreamworks threequel and I can't wait to see where they take this franchise next.10/10.~evangelinebone rated 10/10 on 7 November 2023"," New Characters, Old Friends: Well as a 49-year old woman(giving out my age lol!!), who is a kid at heart with these movies here. Still you have to really love the Trolls.Expect references to boy bands and in jokes from that. With Branch and Poppy as the latter realizes he used to be as a toddler but his three other brothers due to the oldest one being bossy went their separate ways.Forced to be reunited over in next to the youngest, Floyd is kidnapped by the brother-sister antagonists that wanted their own sound but stole from Floyd's.In getting the two other brothers, one married with so many kids, another into yoga, and the other the older brother who bossed everybody around in trying to unite the band to free Floyd.Poppy who thought she was an only child to her king father, realizes she may have a sibling as well. Who looks like her.New characters and old friends. Great for the holiday crowd in kids films.~shelbythuylinh rated 8/10 on 17 November 2023"," Adorable, witty characters with original true to life dialogues and funky soundscore. Definitely suited for grownups as well. Not kiddin': Accidentally stumbled into this movie and what a joy it was. Why did I have such a good time as an adult? Because the (terrific) dialogues are tailormade to grownups first. I am not kiddin'More good: the trolls look absolutely adorable and kids will love the happy go lucky spirit and vivid colors and fastpaced animation. This movie is a sure bet for a fun family time.Such a relief to see an animation movie that is targetted at kids, but which can be be enjoyed by old folks as well. I applaud the writers firstmost for this achievement. The dialogues arent difficult or anything, but there are tons of subtle jokes packaged inside this story, that only grownups will understand.Definitely recommended for young AND old if you are into 90 minutes of charming and witty entertainment.~imseeg rated 8/10 on 24 October 2023"," Delivers A Lot Of Heart, Along With Showing The Importance Of Family Values, Friendship, And Love: I love the new animated musical, Trolls Band Together. The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. Trolls Band Together had me out of my seat, dancing and singing along to all the songs.In the film, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple. As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boy band ""BroZone,"" with his four brothers. BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch has not seen his brothers since. When Branch's bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of pop-star villains, Velvet (Amy Schumer) and Veneer (Andrew Rannells), Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity.Trolls Band Together embraces the boy band era with so many references to everyone's favorite bands. The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. The entire movie is filled with humor, catchy cover songs, amazing animation, and lessons about family. Directed by Walt Dohm and Tim Heitz, the animation in this DreamWorks production is stunning -- all the vibrant colors throughout the movie are amazing. I was not able to take your eyes off the screen. All the music goes so well with the storyline in every scene. It features a new original song, ""Better Place,"" from Justin Timberlake's old boy band NSYNC. It was so fun to sing and dance along. The voice actors are terrific. Timberlake and Kendrick are joined by Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Icona Pop, Anderson Paak, Ron Funches, Kenan Thompson, Kunal Nayyar plus a handful of newcomers. They could not have picked a better group of actors to voice these characters. The script by Elizabeth Tippet is so smart, but my favorite part is all the songs and dances throughout the movie. Trolls movies have been a hit with viewers of all ages and this one is no different. I predict that everyone will be singing and dancing and loving every minute of this movie.The film's message is about family dynamics and how all family relationships are different. It shows viewers that no two families are the same and all families have their differences with each other, but they are still family. Be aware that it contains some rude and suggestive humor and some scary creatures like the Bergens and large spiders, plus the trolls are chased and eaten.I give Trolls Band Together 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults. You can watch Trolls Band Together in theaters on November 17, 2023.

All singers were great , I loved better place and it takes two. Really good songs. My kids also enjoyed it and they loved viva just like me. Camila did a great job voice acting here!!The plot was not as good as the previous ones but it's still really pretty and colourful and I love that. Also the introduction of new characters really did good for the movie plus the latin vibes by viva were awesome. At the end of the day I would just say that everyone here enjoyed it. Money well spent.~izaanshaheer rated 10/10 on 16 November 2023"," 🎨 So many Elements Came Together to Make this Excellent Film 🎤: Another Perfect Watch. It was So entertaining from Start to Finish.Elements -1. 🤡 The Plotline was Great and More Importantly, the Adventure Feel that this film has to it makes it all the more Better.2.🎶 The Musical Numbers, were so entertaining. Literally all of them Musical parts were Great.3. 💐 The Animation, the Vibrancy of the Colours, the Texture of the Animated Objects and Characters were Spectacular to Look at, at times. Visually, it really Popped in multiple Scenes. Even the Troll Hair looked eye-catching.4. 🔮Every Single one of the Different Settings looked Great and one Particular ""World"" if you will, looked Beautiful. Again the animators Crafted such Beauty within this Film.5. 💬 The dialogue was Neat, some of the comedy worked and like with all Comedy, some things people find funny, others won't. People will laugh at different things.6. 🎨 The Characters were Solid, each of the 5 trolls had their distinct characteristics. And the 2 Female Trolls had a Beautiful Bonding 💕. The Baby Diamond (oh sorry), man troll had his moments 💍 🍼7. 💎 The Villain characters - I really liked the Villain Characters and the dynamic they had with eachother, it really Added to the Film. One being completely Unbearable, and the other being Unbearable too but had at least somewhat of a conscience. They both played their ""up themselves, snobby type role"" perfectly.8. 🏁 The Ending, again we're in that Gorgeous Realm and the Villains hit that Musical Number and then the Trolls hit theirs and the Spectacle Concludes with another Giant Visually Spectacular Bang. I loved that Ending 👍Overall, Just such a well made Film.~DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed rated 10/10 on 26 October 2023"," Loved it !!!: As a teenage watching this movie, it's great and absolutely wonderful! I love the different artstyles, locations and characters! There're not just giants and trolls but more to that like human giants etc : mountain Ragenous people and the people in the 'Wish you were here!' Island. The artstyle changes when they tried to hustle and the animation is smooth like butter. I love the songs a lot, especially different time with different songs, it really adds up to the atmosphere. There were times where I felt chills like the first scene of mountain ragenous. I also love the chemistry Poppy and Branch has, its lovely how they depend and listen to each other, love how Veener also has a change of heart and decided to be honest about it. Overall, it's definitely a hundred for me, recommended!!! Maybe not for little kids? Just skip the scenes where tiny 'curses' into the black box. I didnt really pay attention to the bad stuff (if there were any in the first place). I just vibe, chill with the movie, characters and the songs. Kudos to the animators and producers!Watched it when it first came out yesterday <3.~scarlettesirene rated 10/10 on 14 November 2023"," A kind, cute, interesting family cartoon for going to the cinema and watching with the whole family.: Opinion about «Trolls Band Together» (2023):Well, I'll start with the fact that in 2016 the first part of «Trolls» was released, and the same year I went to see it, and then I really liked this cartoon, although even now I think it is quite good.Four years later, the second part was released, I didn't manage to go to the cinema because then all the cinemas began to close due to the pandemic and I had to watch them at home.But the pandemic did not prevent me from enjoying the cartoon, and I liked the second part even more than the first.The announcement of the third part appeared in 2021, the same year I began to wait for this cartoon, and finally it came out in theaters and I was able to go to see it!And the third «Trolls» - is an excellent cartoon on the level of the second part.A kind, cute, interesting family cartoon for going to the cinema and watching with the whole family.The plot was simple, but it was pretty great, light, and interesting.The 92-minute running time was a pleasure.The jokes were funny and the characters were well developed.The graphics of the cartoon were nice and bright, the animation was excellent, the cool thing is that this part combined different styles in animation.The soundtrack of the cartoon is gorgeous! Of the songs that I really liked, I want to mention «Perfect», «Mount Rageous», as well as «Better Place».Also, I was pleased to hear the song «Sweet Dreams».Overall, «Trolls Band Together» - is a great, fun, 92-minute adventure that I'll happily repeat when it comes out in good quality.I think that the digital release will take place in mid-December or early January, because the cartoon will be released in US theaters only on November 17th.My rating is 9 out of 10 and I recommend watching this cartoon, and especially going and watching it in the cinema with the whole family.~anonim-73883 rated 9/10 on 25 October 2023"," Tons of cute visual humor.: IN A NUTSHELL:I think this is a cute franchise, so I was excited to see what they would do with this new sequel. The fact that both Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake were up for a third Trolls movie is evidence that they love this franchise too.The story is about Poppy who discovers that Branch was once in a boy band called ""BroZone"". When one of the brothers is kidnapped, Poppy and Branch embark on another adventure together to rescue him.The film was directed by Walt Dohrn. Writing credits go to Elizabeth Tippet and Thomas Dam.THINGS I LIKED:We get to see all of our favorite characters, plus some new fun ones.The incredibly talented voice talents include Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Camila Cabello, Amy Schumer, Andrew Rannells, Daveed Diggs, Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, RuPaul, Kenan Thompson, Kunal Nayyar, and so many more!Lots and lots of boy band jokes and puns.Tons of cute visual humor.Catchy music and entertaining musical numbers.The animation is very colorful and adorable. It also showcases a few different styles of animation design. It's so great at making you feel the felt and other fabric textures with your eyes.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:The movie assumes you have seen the previous Trolls movies and know these characters' stories and relationships. If you haven't seen the first two films, you'll miss some of the character development.If you enjoy this Trolls franchise, this sequel will be a welcome addition. If you don't, you should probably skip this movie altogether because it's a lot more of the same.We have to wait 37 minutes for a full musical number. After that, the music is almost non-stop.TIPS FOR PARENTS:Parents will appreciate the music, clever jokes, and well-presented values.A character asks someone if she's a ""Narc"". Kids probably won't know what that means.Because the movie was designed for kids, there are a lot of scenes that feature underwear.To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!~trinaboice rated 8/10 on 31 October 2023"

When Smeerensburg's new postman, Jesper, befriends toymaker Klaus, their gifts melt an age-old feud and deliver a sleigh full of holiday traditions."," In a sea of generic Christmas movies, Klaus stands out: Klaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.~cricketbat rated 8/10 on 22 December 2019"," My Christmas watchlist just got a little longer: Everything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired. JK SImmons as the title character, the animation style, the way in which the various elements of the mythos come together organically and so forth all just fit. Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.I will be watching this each year for awhile.~CubsandCulture rated 10/10 on 9 December 2019"," Claus.: Whilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.~morrison-dylan-fan rated 10/10 on 28 December 2020"," Wow, we finally have a new Christmas classic: Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.Of course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say ""Ho! Ho! Ho!?"". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10~Joejoesan rated 9/10 on 14 November 2019"," Never thought I'd give a ""sappy"" cartoon a 10, but what a surprise: Sure, sappiness is cute, and fun to indulge in. I thought I'd seen it all. But what sappiness was in the movie well used. The main thrust was not sappy. It was a well told story, with the proper nuances in the animation and the vocalization. I consider this movie to be for adults. You will thoroughly enjoy it.~andymhancock rated 10/10 on 16 November 2019"," I am not crying, you are crying.: I haven't felt this good after watching a movie. I feel good about myself. I am not kidding, I actually cried during and after the credit rolled. Thank you Netflix.~kaleem_091983 rated 10/10 on 25 November 2019"," KLAUS: The Netflix Classic for Christmas.: I typically wouldn't mention a movie as a classic except for the two first films of Shrek. But Klaus it's amazing.Allow me to explain myself.There are so many reasons why Klaus remains as a classic.FIRST of all and the most visible one:THE ANIMATION. I'm not an animator but I love animation so I can tell when something is beautifully animated. Klaus isn't animated by computer, is hand-drawn animation which involves so much more work and it's worthy at the end because the result is so delightful. The colors, the details, the characters, the locations and every particular aspect are properly drawn, so you feel so good watching it.SECOND: You need more than looks to produce a classic and this film has a pretty good STORY. The plot is simple, a post man is sent to the unhappiest place in the world to deliver 6,000 letters, but in this place nobody delivers letters. Simple, the way that this plot seeks his way to include the origin story of Santa Claus it's amazing. Every twist is graceful and the ending is satisfactory.THIRD: animation and story are reached because of THE CHARACTERS: Every single and unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily.From beginning to end, the film is perfection for the Christmas holiday.~edicionccq rated 10/10 on 23 November 2019"," Anti-Postmodern Santa Claus: If postmodernism is defined as a rejection of morality and human nature, then this animated story is a repudiation of that rejection, but done in a refreshingly adult and not too overly sentimental way.Thankfully, there are none of the usual Hollywood tropes; rather, the characters and situation are very grounded despite having elements of the fantastical and surrealism mixed in. It is not even Disney-esque, which is also a very good good thing.That this ""Santa Claus"" is not the only main character is moreover a good choice by the writers. By doing so, the story is able to focus on how a mythical character could conceivably come to be - and that makes for a very interesting and entertaining premise.Everything about this animated story is well done: The animation is crisp and detailed; the dialogues are convincing and at times humorous; the music fits, is modern, and used judiciously.Young children will not probably understand the deeper meanings, but everyone else will.~keikoyoshikawa rated 9/10 on 17 November 2019"," Watch and learn, Disney: Very solid original story, awesome visual style and great writing. All it takes. On the contrary, reinventing 30 year old cartoons and doubling down on puritan stuff does not help.This film deserves broader recognition - best Christmas catroon in a long long time~tarapov-92-654064 rated 8/10 on 17 November 2019"," Haven't cried after watching an animated movie in so long.: One of the sweetest, emotional and best Animated film of the year.

When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero."," One Step Above Masterpiece!: It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.~MiroslavKyuranov rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," Masterful IMAX Spider-Man: The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," One of the best sequels to anything ever made: If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.~pugpool10 rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," A new Empire Strikes Back: This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.~rickothan rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," Okay This Is Peak: First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.~hectorvernet rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.~cricketbat rated 7/10 on 1 June 2023"," It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5): Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.~nickryan-44535 rated 7/10 on 6 June 2023"," My movie of 2023 so far.: It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 11 June 2023"," This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.: I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.~DeadMansTrousers rated 6/10 on 14 June 2023"," Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it: I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 11 June 2023"

It doesn't manage to spark into life, arguably the most forgettable Disney characters to date.I've read several comments about the animation, and plenty seem to applaud the style, quality and colours, let me be honest, this sucks, the most basic and unimaginative animation I think I've seen, to me it looks unfinished, did they get it out in a rush, or were there budget cuts, this isn't Disney standard, let alone a Centenary special.I genuinely fear for Disney, everything they're touching seems to be going to pot, they need a major shake up, Snow White doesn't look like a classic, where do Disney go from this?Woeful.4/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 4/10 on 8 December 2023"," A sad realization of what Disney movies have come to be: There was once a time not so long ago, when the word 'Disney' in an animated project meant so much; a great storytelling experience was guaranteed and a masterpiece was always possible. But as of late, each Disney project has come to feel like a rehash of every other Disney project; slowly killing any amount of excitement one might have looking forward to each new project.Wish is no different and is as every bit forgettable and uninspiring as people are accusing it of being. If there's anything worth remembering though, it would have to be the watercolor-esque art style, but not even that justifies the movie's existence. Wish lacks depth and is painfully a face-value movie. It has a Disney-protagonist, a Disney-antagonist, a Disney-merch mascot, some Disney-music, and well yea, that's about it.The question though, is if kids would enjoy it. After all, that's who the movie is primarily aimed at. And the answer might be 'yes', but probably at a level no different than how they might enjoy say Cocomelon or something. There's nothing magical that might stand out and nothing that might inspire. It's yet another Disney showcase of good animation with less than nothing else to accommodate.~isaacsundaralingam rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Some anniversary: Wish is a funny, perhaps unfortunate title for this movie. When its trailer came out, and people commented on how its ""storybook illustrations come to life"" visual style looked more like unfinished 3D animation than moving drawings, you bet there were puns aplenty about how this is just ""Spider-Verse from Wish"" -- or, more aptly, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish from Wish"" but that one sounds a bit clunky.Indeed, for all the talk of how Wish would be a grand return for Disney Fairy Tales™ that also, I guess to commemorate Disney's centennial, would somehow ""personify"" the wishing star we see in many of their films, the reception wasn't exactly across-the-board ecstatic. On top of how weird the animation looked to people -- which is odd since we know Disney can nail 2D-looking 3D, as with 2013's The Paperman -- several critics remarked on how a lot of the post-2010 Disney movies (Pixar, too) reduce themselves to ""Pick a culture to explore; make generational trauma the villain"" and, more importantly, have interchangeable adorkable/awkward/""quirky"" female protagonists that oft sound more like Millennial YouTubers than fairy tale heroines.Ever since Tangled, the new ""princesses"" have tried to replicate the vibe of Mandy Moore's Rapunzel on some level. Wish also exemplifies that weird trend of post-Tangled Disney/Pixar films of having one-word titles that don't sound very whimsical or exciting. (Kudos to DALLEE 3: It tends to get this right when generating fake posters for ""Pixar's *INSERT HISTORICAL ATROCITY HERE*"".) If they ever adapt H. C. Andersen's The Princess and the Pea, mark my words that it'll just be named Pea.The plot: The ruler of the Mediterranean kingdom of Rosas, King Magnifico, has the magical ability to keep the ""wishes"" of the populace in his custody to grant/return as he sees fit; each citizen has to give theirs up as they come of age. His new apprentice, Asha, senses that evil is afoot and discovers that she is able to make wishes irrespective of the king's approval, turning towards the stars and even summoning a sentient wishing star named... Star. And yes, the plushie should be in stores now.Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, and Alan Tudyk, who naturally plays the comic animal sidekick, are all fairly funny in their roles from time to time and I may even have vibed with one of the songs. Sadly, my verdict mirrors the one that everyone else seems to have: I will not be remembering this movie in a few weeks, beyond the myriad jokes at its expense.I suppose the Wish situation might partly be explained by the awakening that's been happening all throughout 2023, where mainstream movies get to be truly good and artful again, and so people realize that Disney's films may not be all that interesting -- and, moreover, may not be worth defending under pretenses of activism. We are more aware than ever that options exist. Even if you truly refuse to bring back 2D animation and opt to meet people halfway by making a sort of 2D-3D hybrid, we can find more seamless attempts in such movies as Klaus (which is also a better call-back to older Disney designs than this is) and, like I said, the Spider-Verse films.I do think people act a bit dismissive toward the picture, and there are things to appreciate in it -- particularly its storybook opening sequence that mimics the typography of the one from Snow White; other images recall the likes of Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Pocahontas, etc. Alas, I think the best version of the movie was lost to another timeline where less corporate meddling took place. (Did I mention that the songs were written, not by someone with experience in musicals, but by a person who's written songs for Justin Bieber?)We should also give Wish this, however: It made droves of people, be they fans (the thinking, non-zealous kind) or film critics, truly appreciate what this studio used to give us, especially during the Disney Renaissance -- from the superior emotional resonance of the songs to the heavy stakes and grandiloquent visuals (most notably in Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame), not to mention the variety of the 2D-animated styles compared to now, when most of the movies look like they inhabit pretty much the same universe.If you want a true celebration of Disney's magic over the past century 'til now, I'd rather you check out the Disney+ short Once Upon A Studio (which I managed to enjoy despite being reminded not two days later of what Disney has become, as they announced another slew of remakes, even one of effing Frozen). Asha, the latest addition to the world of Disney princesses, joining hands with Snow White, the first-ever of the princesses, is significantly more poetic and moving than anything in Wish.~TheVictoriousV rated 4/10 on 22 November 2023"," Being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it was forgettable: In the past few years, I haven't really been big with Disney's recent animated movies as while I did like ""Soul"" and ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", the other works like ""Luca, Encanto, Lightyear, Strange World, Elemental and Turning Red"" I wasn't really big on. ""Wish"", being the 100th Anniversary for Disney, manages to be bland and boring at its best.Throughout, the animation is solid as there are some good colors, solid structures and designs. There are some good musical instrumental backgrounds as well. I do appreciate that the story isn't based on a sequel, remake or something that already exists and Disney tries to introduce new characters and settings. But the issue is that the narrative is way too familiar from other stories and it lacks the creativity, energy and charm of the good old Disney princess movies which makes it pretty difficult to fully engage with emotionally or to care for. The lack of energy and bland style causes the characters to not be investing as well since none of the characters were engaging or interesting at all. However, the voice performances from the cast members are pretty good. Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine both provided really good voice performances. Including Alan Tudyk as Tudyk is great as usual with his voice works.The animation, as I mentioned, it's solid as the design models, colors, and movements are pretty good. With the animation using a mix of computer and watercolor, there are some really nice moments but admittedly, there were some animated movements or looks that felt odd, bland and slightly distracting. The dialogue is pretty clunky, the direction was boring, and the singing or musical moments, despite one or two songs being not too bad, the singing and song-writing wasn't good as some of the sound felt like it was written from AI. Like some of the voice and singing sound effects were pretty off. And as a whole, it was mostly boring.For this being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it's quite embarrassing since there could have been any other movie that could have been pretty fun and all but it seemed Disney decided to go with the bland route.Overall, children and families will be entertained but this one is definitely one of Disney's weaker movies.~chenp-54708 rated 3/10 on 22 November 2023"," Disney meets ChatGPT: Every element of this movie feels like it was generated by a lackluster AI program.The heroine has no apparent drive or motivations outside of the immediate plot, and has the same cute but generic ""adorkable"" vibe as Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. She's enough of a cypher to let anyone put themselves in her place.The villain is a blandly handsome king whose motivations boil down to ""worship me"" and ""more power."" He lacks the complexity of Frollo or Gothel, and the charisma of Scar or Ursula. He's empty enough that you can imagine him as an analogue for whatever politician you dislike.The supporting cast was a pile of generic stock characters. Ably enough acted, but utterly forgettable. None were developed enough to be interesting.The music is lively, but instantly forgettable. After Frozen, Tangled, and Moana, my kids sang garbled toddler versions of the songs on the ride home. After Wish? Nothing. Not even a hum.The art was interesting. The watercolor-ish style worked for the backgrounds, and captured some of the feel of classic Disney films. But the characters seemed crudely pasted atop the background. More than any recent Disney film, you could FEEL the computers behind the animation.The plot was uninspired. There were a handful of places where the writers could have taken different paths, and asked interesting questions about the nature of power and responsibility, but they abandoned them in favor of a one-dimensional and utterly predictable story.Even the worst flops in the Disney archives had something going for them. Brother Bear was beautiful, Home on the Range was funny, and Dinosaur was a technological leap forward. Wish has nothing. Was it terrible? No. Was it memorable? Definitely not. Will anyone bother to see it more than once? I doubt it.~senexbarbatus rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023", Wish has terrible writing and gives off a terrible message.: First few minutes I was interested. The idea of everyone having a wish seems dangerous. So I sympathized with the villain. I expected the struggle to grant everyone's wishes would lead to undesired outcome that the girl would have to fix. In doing so becoming the villain herself as her selfishness would have brought disaster and I thought the king would be proved right and the girl's selfishness would lead to the king sacrificing himself to save everyone. Teaching the girl a lesson about stealing and maintain order. It would have been a good twist if the initial villain ended up being the good guy after all and the girls action would make her the villain. Then there could have been a redemption arc for her in the final act. The Star could have been some type of neutral being that ended up becoming evil due to all the negative wishes overpowering the good wishes. Then there could have been that one pure heart wish that overpowered all the bad wishes and restoring the stars position to either neutral or good. The premise was there. It could have been so good. But none of that happened.In this movie the girl is perfect she cannot do any wrong. She has no hero's journey. Everyone in the story is perfect except the main villain and he wouldn't have been corrupted if not for the girls actions. What she did to him was basically entrapment. I lesson I got from this movie is stealing is ok if it's for family. No one is capable of making bad wishes. Which is not true. If I was or anyone had the power to grant wishes we too would be worried about handing out wishes like candy. I think any one with common sense would know how dangerous that can be. What ever happened to the old school Disney movies That had consequences for your actions. Those were some real lessons. The queens actions in the end are criminal. The king never imprisoned any one. He never robbed them of their freedom but she did. She basically sentenced him to die. For guarding wishes.The star thing was cute tho. That thing is going to sell merchandise. The animation was good. The songs won't be classics. They're forgettable. The only characters that have good design are the king and the star.~mbbpkgf rated 3/10 on 24 November 2023," A Bland, Uninspired, & Formulaic Missed Opportunity (that also fell under TikTok's crosshairs): This movie was boring af. The first song is pretty and I appreciated the chalky animation that appears inspired by the Puss in Boots sequel. Beyond that I was bored to tears.The plot is beat-by-beat, the villain is pure formula & paper-thin, and they don't invest in any running gags or in enriching any side characters. It's as if they had to reach a deadline so put in the minimal effort necessary to get it finished, which left us with a hollow movie devoid of any magic, held together only by its mind-numbingly predictable narrative.I feel bad for those who worked hard on this film because this could have been a good movie if the studio just took the time to fill it with personality and character. Instead, Wish is a pretty lifeless addition to the Disney canon.Note: Apparently there has been a hate-train trashing this film trending all over TikTok. It is why my niece already had a well-formulated opinion on the film at Thanksgiving dinner without having even seen it. Sadly, the thoughts she echoed were pretty spot-on, so she just saved me the trouble of warning her against it.~Lepidopterous_ rated 4/10 on 26 November 2023"," Uninspired: Who would have known that, of all organizations in the world, Disney would be the one to forget that nothing matters more than love? After all those years hammering the message into our heads, they have forgotten it themselves! And that is one of the many issues with Wish. There's no love interest, and we, the audience, lose interest.Maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we should appreciate that love for your grandpa and your mom is enough, and that friendship with your buddies is equally important as passionate love. Or maybe Disney could make peace with love. When a young person loves another, it doesn't necessarily mean that they need to let go of their personality, ambitions, ideals or for that matter, wishes. Love can be, usually is, a good thing.Making an emotional story without love is not impossible, but it's hard. And the ingredients are not there in Wish. In the absence of love, humor can help. But the secondary characters in Wish, Valentino the goat or the mute lucky star, are not very good, and not funny at all. The music could help, but the songs aren't all that memorable. And the main characters, while decent, can't quite carry the story. Asha, a mix of Moana, Elsa and Pocahontas, is okay but she seems to lack a clear purpose that is believable, and we never really care much about her. Magnifico, the villain, may be the best character, but he feels so much like a rehash of other villains before him, that we struggle to see him as a character in his own right.Left without emotion, without humor, without great music, the film doubles down on weaponry, raising the stakes on the use of dark magic with every scene to try and keep the audience awake. But it's not enough. I dozed off a few times.My advice to Disney: make love, not war.~apereztenessa-1 rated 3/10 on 25 November 2023"," Another Lackluster Movie from Disney: What a disappointment to see yet another lackluster movie from Disney animation. I don't know why Disney animators can't create another Lion King or Little Mermaid or other engaging, fun movie. I remember taking my young kids to the annual Disney blockbuster movie - they were all excellent. But current creative staff aren't that creative and are making movies that nobody wants to see.The story is very generic and the songs, by pop singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, are rather uninspiring. But I have to admit that DeBose and Pine performed the generic songs well. The only time Wish shines bright is when it dares to get a little bit odd. Asha wishes on a star for everyone in Rosas to get their wish (so that they can work toward making them come true for themselves), and a plump, wiggly and mischievous star pops out of the sky and pays her a visit, sprinkling stardust on plants and inanimate objects, bringing them to dancing, singing life.The real test was that my grandkids were bored instead of being inspired. Disney needs to get another group of animators who can go back to making fun, imaginative again.~elizabethjeanhampton rated 2/10 on 23 November 2023"," I WISH this movie didn't exist.: Disney Disney Disney... they could've made the ""Disney 100 movie"" be an unfinished idea from Walt himself, but sadly went the boring profitable route. The animation is so bad, it's not a cool 3D-2D like Arcane or Puss-In-Boots. Like why did they make this. The humor is weird. It's not kiddy but it just doesn't have an age range, so expect every age range to not find it funny. I wish I knew who this movie was made for, to every age group it's a forgettable movie. And it's sad to think even with disneys 100 year anniversary they chose money over story.

Enjoyable treat!: Due to life lessons, this film was made for kids and adults! This is a beautiful, heartening, and emotional (shed a few tears) animated film. This was a surprise. I did not know what to expect, but it was a gem! It kept me smiling throughout the whole film!! The kids in the movie and those watching at home learn important lessons about empathy and self-forgiveness from wise lizard Leo (Sandler) and his ability to lend a supportive ear. It was one of the best family films I've seen in a long time! The film can be summed up in one of its final lines: ""Find your Leo (a representation of meaningful listening, mixed with prudent advice) to listen to you."" The ""Leos"" we should look for can connect and offer sound advice precisely because they are lovingly listening rather than dictating. I love a film with a positive message, which is why I resonated with the story! Bravo to Adam Sandler, who is a fantastic voice actor! The humor and songs were catchy and funny! The last movie I loved from Sandler was 50 First Dates, and afterward, I couldn't connect with his films until Leo!

Both are stuck in glass tank at the school watching life go by in the classroom, when a big change happens that leads the both of them, on a complete turn events.Each human kid and adult are profiled and transformed in quite hilarious ways, and the songs are not to be taken seriously as you will be laughing along with the visual gags that go with the flow.It looks all brilliant and the character designs work and not look dopey, which seems to be a trend these days, bad character design. Great musical numbers that are well staged are used just right. Adam Sandler is noted down as writer and producer, it's his company, after all. More like this please, Adam.~donmurray29 rated 8/10 on 12 November 2023"," A Coming-Of-Age Story, Seen Through The Eyes Of A School's Class Pet: I love the movie Leo -it is funny and relatable. Leo is a coming-of-age story, seen through the eyes of a school's class pet, as much as it is a coming-to-terms with aging story.The story features Leonardo (Adam Sandler) and Squirtle (Bill Burr) who are quick witted, full of jokes and the best classroom pets ever. Leonardo, Leo for short, overhears a parent saying that lizards live up to 75; at age 74, Leo decides it is time to escape and live his life to the fullest. In comes strict ""old school"" substitute teacher Ms. Malkin (Cecily Strong) who wants to teach the 5th graders responsibility by taking turns to care for the classroom pets over the weekend. Each reluctant 5th grader who takes Leo home discovers his secret, along with wisdom about who they are and how they can better fit in the world. Every student returns Leo to the classroom and Squirtle is his biggest fan, boosting Leo's spirits and outlook on his caged life. When his secret is revealed, jealousy and distrust seeps in and Ms. Malkin, who feels the most threatened, takes Leo away.Each 5th grader experiences positive change after their time with Leo and, in return, Leo experiences living like he never has before. The animation is colorful and realistic, from the background scenery to the small details like how a caterpillar is depicted. Each of the actors who play the 5th graders fits their character from their personality to their hair and body type. I especially liked Summer (Sunny Sandler) with her fast-talking, super sweet kindness, as well as the overly ""great"" and popular Jayda (Sadie Sandler). The little balls of energy that represent the kindergarteners are on point. And from the overprotected, super-safe, drone-watched home of Eli (Roey Smigel) to the over-the -top, mega-great mansion of Jayda's family, it is easy to get a sense of each character from their surroundings. The musical element of Leo propels the characters into songs that tell of their struggles, hopes and dreams while moving the story along in a beautiful way. I like the opening song that expresses how the last year of elementary school is about being on top and the melancholy song toward the end of the film each 5th grader sings about when they were younger.While facing his mortality, Leo learns the important lesson that he has a lot of life experience to share. He is transformed from a grumpy old lizard with nothing to show for his 74 years to beloved friend and confidant who discovers he has many more years ahead of him. Another theme of Leo is in the significance of not underestimating yourself and the film delivers the message to live an authentic life by sharing your talents and being true.I give Leo 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults.

I will ne rewatching this one for sure.~bryantmadeline rated 10/10 on 23 November 2023"," We all need someone to talk to.: 'Leo' is a film with a message. It cleverly introduces us to very different characters to convey powerful messages about different members of our society. Being an animated film and aimed at a young demographic, 'Leo' can almost serve as an educational video to youngsters - and they will be thoroughly entertained at the same time. In the process, they will learn about insecurity, vanity, and various misconceptions kids might have about life.Leo is a lizard, who has been living in captivity for 74 years. Erm, correction, he's been the class pet since 1949 and lives in a glass cabinet in a classroom, with his best friend Squirtle the turtle. With their beloved teacher going on maternity leave, the class now faces a strict, elderly substitute teacher, Mrs Malkin. In order to teach them responsibility, she suggests a pupil takes home one of the class pets for a weekend to care for them.And so the kids in turn take home Leo, who turns out to be a talking lizard. To each kid, Leo tells them they are the only one able to hear him, and in the process he has a profound impact on their lives as he gives them advise on their personal dilemmas. My favourite character was Eli, a kid with over-protective parents who has a drone to look after him. The drone itself was a delightful and funny character.With many scenes being very cartoonish and a bit silly, this film is definitely more for kids. Having said that, it is still a film adults will enjoy, too, and there are indeed many very funny moments. Towards the end it also becomes an action-packed adventure.The only thing I didn't like about the movie, was all the constant singing. Ever since the huge success of 'Frozen', so many animated movies since features musical segments. It's like found footage movies that overstayed its welcome. I get it, young kids like so sing or hum to a catchy melody when they watch cartoons, but I found it a little annoying. Oh, go on, call me a grump if you must...In general, 'Leo' is an enjoyable film, and yes, I definitely enjoyed it.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 25 November 2023"," Being green has never been so easy!: Adam Sandler has, in particular, made two very smart decisions in his career. One was starring in Punch-Drunk Love and proving that he is secretly one of the finest actors of our time. The other was starring in Hotel Transylvania. By branching out into animation geared towards families, Sandler found a proper vehicle for his silliest abilities and doing so without alienating people with the kind of overly juvenile humor that plagued his comedy movies in the 2000's. He's back voicing an elderly and wise lizard in Leo. Folks, I mean this without a hint of irony when I say that Leo is very nearly the funniest movie of the year. I expected to like this movie, but I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did. Credit belongs to veteran SNL writer, Robert Smigel. Leo is filled to the brim with a Shrek 2-caliber of amazing sight gags. Plus, it has the funniest interpretation of kindergarteners that I've ever seen. As for Adam Sandler, he brings a level of warmth and goofiness to his character that felt like a loving tribute, both in style and tone, to the late, great, Gilbert Gottfried. No, this isn't a lame showcase of a new Sandler voice that will drive you mental by the 10-minute mark. Leo is a lovable protagonist. The cringey and forced musical numbers hold this thing back from being a pretty solid animated movie all around.~aciessi rated 6/10 on 6 December 2023"," Funny wholesome movie. Disney take notes!: Great movie. Fun and entertaining for the whole family. Adults and kids both laughing. Wholesome! Best kids and family movie I have seen in years. Disney please take notes. I call movies like these Disney Destroyers. It delivered wholesome positive messages, that were not forced, but delivered comically. This movie was entertaining, funny, yet emotional and projected positivity towards kids. I loved that kids in movie were taught to reflect inward, face their issues and change. I love that political controversial topics were avoided, I love that political messages are not being force fed to me and my family.~reyesjerardo rated 10/10 on 23 November 2023"," Cant go wrong with Sandler and Burr: I paid to see it early today in theatres, and i have no regrets. If both Adam Sandler and Bill Burr are in a movie, go watch it right away. Those 2 guys are legendary comedic heavyweights. The theatre was not packed at all, and the movie was absolutley hilarious. Its kid friendly, but of course with these 2 guys running the show, you know theyre going to throw in some jokes that only us adults can appreciate. I would say that this movie is wayy better than the last movie i watched which was the latest hunger games film. I left that movie early. But this movie Leo, i stayed in my seat and didnt even pull out my phone to check the time.. not even once. I will definitely watch Leo again when they finally release it on netflix.~kennyjax-76480 rated 10/10 on 20 November 2023"," An impressive surprise amidst the new releases: Randomly saw this movie on Netflix and gave it a shot. Even as a children-family oriented movie, I liked it.Adam Sandler has been on a streak of featuring in movies were mostly okay or so so. Leo turned out to be better than expected with satisfying parameters.While most of the interactions were with children, the offered wisdom and guidance to help them was insightful. This movie is a good reminder everyone is going through their own struggles in life. People are not alone in their daily problems, everyone needs some help sooner than never.It was interesting to see some adult like references which were played out very well. This is a good movie, a nice watch on a relaxing day.~GryeD rated 7/10 on 27 November 2023"

Quinn,Robert Zemeckis,Charles Dickens|Robert Zemeckis,"An animated retelling of Charles Dickens' classic novel about a Victorian-era miser taken on a journey of self-redemption, courtesy of several mysterious Christmas apparitions."," A new twist on ""A Christmas Carol"" with Jim Carrey in several roles...: From an artistic viewpoint, the new Robert Zemeckis film from the man who gave us THE POLAR EXPRESS, is another of his animated features using the motion picture capture technique that allows the actors to play several roles. The cinematography is exceptionally well done.JIM CARREY, as miserly Ebenizer Scrooge, looks nothing like his real self. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would.The visit from three spirits is more frightening than usual, since Zemeckis decided to throw everything he could into startling special effects--sometimes with very gruesome results. The sight of Marley's Ghost with a flapping jaw that has to be realigned by Marley is just one of the ""extra"" touches. Some of the ""spirit"" scenes are too intense for small children, more likely to frighten them than anything else.There are times when the story remains very faithful to the Dickens book, sometimes even word for word. But when Zemeckis decides to show off that the camera can do with flying aerial scenes zooming over Victorian London, it begins to stray a bit. Biggest stray is a chase scene that has a miniature Scrooge going through drain pipes to escape an oncoming coach and horses trying to run him down.The lovely score by Alan Silvestri blends perfectly with the on screen action and includes a number of traditional Christmas favorites. GARY OLDMAN and COLIN FIRTH do well in key supporting roles but it's really Carrey's show all the way. He plays several main characters with great skill.Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel. Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids.~Doylenf rated 6/10 on 19 November 2009"," Both children and adults will gain more from this experience than most family films.: After directing The Polar Express in 2004, Robert Zemeckis vowed to only make 3D movies using motion-capture technology from then on, never to return to traditional live action films again. What? How could he? Moviegoers everywhere were bemused at how the bloke who gave us Forrest Gump, the Back to the Future trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Contact and Cast Away could settle for some silly 3D business. Perhaps Zemeckis was smarter than us all though, his pledge to developing a decent 3D output coming half a decade earlier than most. It seems he was on to something.It is credit to Zemeckis though that his use of 3D isn't the drawcard for this wonderfully told fable, it purely enhances it. The opening title sequence is one of the most breathtaking of the year, as we soar over - and through - the old Victorian town in which Scrooge inhabits in only one shot. It doesn't end there however, with no less than two more flying scenes and a splendid chase sequence on foot, which capably show what mo-cap and 3D are capable of. One small gripe, as was present with Up, the glasses still make everything darker and subsequently duller; especially as this picture is intentionally not well-lit to begin with.We all know the famous Charles Dickens novel for which this is based on and Zemeckis stays faithfully close to it, unworried about making a family movie that has very few laughs. Let's face it, the story of Scrooge isn't meant to be a light-hearted laughfest. With demonic horses (complete with glaring red eyes), ghosts with broken jaws and men withering away to a skeleton, this is anything but a hoot. But is that a bad thing? Not at all. In fact it is a relief to see a movie for young (but not too young) and old that doesn't shy away from evoking feelings of fear and regret rather than always sugar-coating them with funny moments. If dealt with rightly, emotions like these can be healthy and will have a longer lasting effect on you and your kids than something that only makes you laugh.Providing the voice of Scrooge from childhood to old-age, along with the three Ghosts of Christmas, Carrey does a fine job, even with his normal over-the-top voicing toned down a few hundred decibels. He is barely recognisable in all his parts - a result that I'm sure Zemeckis would have been aiming for - which allows the characters to stand on their own two feet rather than be a typical Carrey product. The experienced supporting cast of Oldman, Hoskins, Firth, Elwes and Wright Penn add a nice level of class to the proceedings.The dark and morose atmosphere might at first shock, but ultimately both children and adults will gain more from this experience than most family films. See it on the big screen.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)~Troy_Campbell rated 8/10 on 6 November 2009"," Do some basic research parents: I read that this film has been labeled by parents as a ""Disney Bomb"" because it's too scary for their young children. Parents who take kids to see any movie need to be aware of something: if it's rated PG there are likely going to be scenes that your six year old will not enjoy -- even if the name Disney is attached to it. The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney's own Mickey's Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The plot should be familiar to just about anyone who has been alive sometime during the past 150 years, and the fact that there are spirits (ghosts) in the story should also be a red flag to parents. Especially since two of them are downright frightening in just about any version of the story.The truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The dialogue is taken nearly word-for-word from the book, and the look and feel of the film brilliantly capture what you would imagine wintertime in London in the 19th century to be like. A few of the special effects are a bit over-the-top, but most work well and add enough pizazz for cynical modern-day audiences. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone.Once every few months I'm dragged kicking and screaming to see a new film. I can't stand wasting my hard-earned dollar on the crap Hollywood throws at us these days, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoy a movie. This was definitely one of those rare times.~kevcom rated 8/10 on 12 November 2009"," Fine Interpretation for Adults: Not for Children: What would Christmas be without a visit to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', a story that dates back to 1843 and has been loved and read every year at this time? There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about. Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful. Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible. Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history. Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others. The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed. One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill. But they will grow into the film as it is likely a work that will be resurrected every Christmas season as a tradition. It is 'excellent, my good fellows'.

So merry Christmas and try to be the transformed scrooge or as close as u can!!~joiningjt rated 10/10 on 9 December 2020"," The same take on Dickens' tale but somewhat darker: There have been many films based on Charles Dickens' Christmas carol and each one has their own way of telling it. This version is no different story wise (obviously). The only things changed were the visuals and tone. There was nothing I didn't like about this film but there were parts that make me question whether this movie was intended for children.The voice cast to this story is pretty remarkable. Just like how Tom Hanks was able to do multiple voices for The Polar Express (2004), Jim Carrey plays Scrooge and various other characters throughout. Along side Carrey is Carey Elwes, Robin Wright, Bob Hoskins and much more. Surprisingly, the audience will be able to identify which actor/actress is doing the voice for whomever the character they are portraying. I suppose the voice characterizations were not needed to be enhanced. But it's blatantly clear whose speaking for whom. Visually, the film's animation is nothing to scorn at either. Much of the characters, the backgrounds and lighting is accurately spaced, colored and shaded. Perhaps the most colorful spectacle is the transition between the spirits who visit Scrooge during his sleep. But what's extremely odd is how all the animated characters in this movie look like the actors who give them their voice; especially Scrooge! Look closely when he's on screen; Scrooge at the current time, looks like a weathered Jim Carrey and the younger version of Scrooge looks like Carrey as he is now. I'm curious if the animators knew this while making the film.Nevertheless, I am leery about the reactions small children will have if they are given the chance to view this film. Scenes where Marley, Scrooges' partner, pays him a visit from hell, or when the ghost of Christmas present dies, is on the edge of being dark. Marley having a lazy eye, or dislocating his jaw? Ehh...not quite sure what those parts were put in for. Comedy? Or the dying ghost of Christmas present having a maniacal laugh? That kind of stuff could freak out a child. The ghost of Christmas yet to come is always a spooker for kids. I'm surprised Disney went through with it. It's not bad though. I liked the change, but it's not suitable for a child maybe under twelve.Overall Zemeckis' take on Dickens' Christmas carol is visually intriguing and has a great voice cast. All the same, there are some elements in this film that are darker than usual and that's puzzling especially for Disney.~breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com rated 8/10 on 8 June 2012"," a high-point for director Zemeckis, and a good step forward in motion-capture: I wonder if Robert Zemeckis weren't a filmmaker if he would have become a pilot. Look at his films and you may find a recurring shot in them, if not all then at least a good lot of them: a shot up in the sky, flying around and bringing the audience along (i.e. the feather in Forrest Gump, the pull-back through the valley and mountains in Beowulf, Back to the Future with the flying Dolorean), and here too are shots like that, more than one in fact. It's exhilarating to see Zemeckis at a mastery of this particular shot, and in the full scope and awe in 3D it's even stronger to watch and wonder 'how did they do it(?)' With motion-capture, anything is possible... except, sadly, making one feel a true emotional connection to the material.Oh, don't get me wrong. It's an improvement over The Polar Express, whose creepiness was more unto itself and jarring as opposed to serving the story, and one can already see advancements in the technology from Beowulf, which was also lots of fun and had an edge to it allowed only with the digital animation. But for some reason- maybe my heart is a lump of coal or I wasn't in the right Christmas spirit or something- the material in the film didn't connect with me, except those moments that were funny (intentionally or not, sometimes due to Jim Carrey's performance), and it became something peculiar. It's a story that is practically timeless, and the director is at the top of his game, almost at the same control of the medium for a particular story like Forrest Gump or Back to the Future - maybe more-so.It's also still a WOOSH experience, not carrying the same time and effort for characters to really feel fully human before our eyes like, for example, Up did back in the summer. I mention all of this first since the story we all know pretty much (as an aside, I kept thinking back to the first incarnation of the story I saw as a child, the Muppet Christmas Carol, and marveled at how both that and this film kept much of the book's dialog and storytelling devices exactly), and it's almost pointless to recant it here. What is paramount to mention though is that Zemeckis, in keeping with the tone of the original Dickens text (and having the clout that he has), makes it a true Victorian horror movie.It should be said also that children will be hit or miss with this version; while they'll delight and be awed by the animation and moments of craziness (my favorite being the scene with the ghost Marley and his entire presentation before Scrooge, unhooked jaw uneasily included), they may be put off by the ""old"" language, some of it in that olde 19th century English Dickens wrote in. Perhaps this is why, against his own better judgment, Zemeckis decided to add in a few scenes to change the very faithful adaptation, the key one being the chase through the streets of London in the Christmas-Future sequence. This is smack dab in the middle of what is the best segment of the film - seeing death as a silhouette with a bony finger and Scrooge's stark pleas is truly chilling - and it suddenly makes it also the worst. It kills the tension and makes a strange sensation: does one laugh at a tiny-voiced Scrooge running around like a mini Daffy Duck cartoon while he's supposed to be facing down his own demise? It's entertaining to watch, but awkward to behold at this point of the story.That the motion-capture, for all of its beauty and detail in the faces and people and locations and dazzling set-pieces, doesn't engage on a purely spiritual level (not even to the extent that 'Muppet Christmas' did, that at least had the ghost of Henson on the production to keep things truly haunting), is somewhat forgivable for what Zemeckis does accomplish here. He puts a modern spin on a classic tale, makes it approximately dark and mostly uncompromising for all ages- adults will jump possibly more than the kids at the WHOA effects- and Jim Carrey is nothing short of astonishing.Carrey plays Scrooge in such a bravura way that only calls attention to itself as a dramatic part (only toward the end, when he becomes ""happy"" Scrooge are there a few unintentional laughs), and it may even be the best Scrooge seen in many years in any medium. Added to this are his *other* parts in the film, as the ghosts of Christmas past and present, the former creepy just on the pronunciation of 's'. Others like Gary Oldman and Colin Firth come off more or less fine if not remarkable (Oldman as Marley is fantastic - as Cratchit, a Oldman-faced Hobbit, is another thing).~Quinoa1984 rated 7/10 on 9 November 2009"," God Bless Us Everyone: In the Victorian era of the United Kingdom, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) that hates Christmas and people loses his partner Jacob Marley in a Christmas Eve. For seven years, he runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) and spends a bitter treatment to his nephew and acquaintances. However, in the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of the chained Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and God bless us everyone, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew and people in general. This dark adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens to the screen is one of those optimistic films that follows the style of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and it is impossible not loving it. The redemption of the mean Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Eve is one of the most known worldwide novels and this animation produced by Disney Company follows the style of Tim Burton and may not be the best adaptation to the cinema, but it is indeed effective and a good family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Fantasmas de Scrooge"" (""The Ghosts of Scrooge"")~claudio_carvalho rated 7/10 on 30 March 2010"," One of the best versions I've seen: Who doesn't like Christmas? Or at least parts of it? One of my favorite things about Christmas are the movies and stories that come with it. One of the most classic stories is Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol, the ending always gets in me in tears and reminds me why Christmas can be so special. I love every rendition of the story: A Muppets Carol, Scrooged, the classic Christmas Carol from the 80's and so on, even the cheesy TV specials. Honestly, when I first heard about this movie, I had my doubts. The CGI fest really freaks me out, it's like we are being replaced with animation and like we won't need real actors in the future. But someone lent me the movie and I decided to give it a fair chance since I love this story and I'm glad I did because I was pleasantly surprised with A Christmas Carol.Ebenezer Scrooge, a bitter old moneylender at a counting house hates everything that embodies the joys and spirit of Christmas. He refuses to visit his cheerful nephew Fred at his Christmas dinner party with his family, and forcing his underpaid employee Bob Cratchit to beg to take the day off for his own family. That night, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley who had died seven years prior on Christmas Eve and is now forced to spend his afterlife carrying heavy chains that were forged from his own greedy ways. Marley warns Scrooge that he will suffer an even worse fate if he does not repent and foretells that he will be haunted by three spirits that will help guide him: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present and The Ghost of Christmas Future. They take him on a journey in what was, is and can be if he doesn't change soon.Though the animation still bothers me as I don't think you can convey real human emotion through the CGI people, but I really did like this movie a lot. I thought the whole atmosphere was just gorgeous and really captured the colors of Christmas. All the voice actors did an incredible job, though one complaint is what the heck was with Jim Carrey's accent? He's trying to be British but sounds like Borat trying to do an English Accent. I loved the animation on the ghosts, they were just breath taking. I'm also relieved that they didn't water down the horror of the ghosts, they were genuinely frightening and a lot of the imagery was very haunting. A lot of people forget that the novel despite having a wonderful ending is very scary at the same time. It took being frightened out of his wits that Scrooge changes.I really did like this version of A Christmas Carol and I think some people are being a bit too harsh. I'm not saying that it's not without flaws, but it tells the story beautifully and doesn't insult the children's intelligence. It's beautifully set and wonderfully acted, I think Charles Dickens would be proud of this presentation. It's a timeless story that can be told in many different ways, but sometimes you can't go wrong with the simple classic style. A Christmas Carol is sure to become a classic in years to come, it deserves another chance.9/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 9/10 on 20 May 2012"," This is a nice, fresh delivery of the classic A Christmas Carol Dickens masterpiece that is definitely worth a viewing.: A Christmas Carol (2009) is a movie that I recently watched with my daughter on Disney+. The storyline delivers the classic Charles Dickens storyline in a fresh animation format with far more intensity and darkness than you'd expect from an animated picture.This movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future) and contains the voices of Jim Carrey (The Mask), Gary Oldman (True Romance), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Cary Elwes (Princess Bride), Robin Wright (Forrest Gump) and Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit).The animation in this is remarkably good as are the presentation of the ghosts. I was thoroughly impressed by the settings and visualizations. The voices are well selected and Scrooge looked very similar to Carrey. There were many intense and scary elements, especially at the beginning and end. There were a couple elements they went a bit too far, like the scene on the cover, but it didn't detract from the enjoyment of the film.Overall this is a nice, fresh delivery of the classic A Christmas Carol Dickens masterpiece that is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 7/10 on 10 December 2021"

Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.Disney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (""Circle of Life"" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. ""Circle of Life"" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.Most of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise ""Circle of Life"" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.Didn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" come off well (especially ""Circle of Life""), ""Be Prepared"" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. ""Spirit"" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.Excepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.Summing up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10~TheLittleSongbird rated 6/10 on 3 December 2019"," It just doesn't really work...: ... with real, life-like animals.

Still, before turning into a voracious corporate blob, Disney was still the quintessential dream factory and nostalgia builder for many, many, many generations. And even for these direct-to-video sequels that spread all over the 2000s like a bad cold, some brain cells of imaginations were mobilized.But now Disney's not even trying to pretend, investing all the efforts on a pure technical level and the kind of marketing-that-speaks-for-itself. It is one thing to adapt fairy tales into live-actions, before ""Cinderella"", there was ""Enchanted"", ""Maleficent"" or even Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"". And yet Disney executives found the trick: it's not about adapting the fairy tale but the Disney version of it. Thorns are still invisible over the head with the two round ears but right now in 2022, it seems that ""awakening your inner child"" isn't a motto anymore but a formula.The formula could have interesting results: the 2016 ""Jungle Book"" film could center on little Mowgli and diverged from the 1967 film. Same with ""Dumbo"" or ""Aladdin"". But exclusively animal-centered movies like ""The Lion King"", ""Bambi"" or ""The Lady and the Tramp"" are a different challenge. You've got to humanize the way animals could act, react or display emotions. Take the kiss between Lady and the Tramp, the magic is not within the moment their mouths meet but the cute and genuine embarrassment that follows. You can't ""animate"" these emotions with live-action animals with all the technology of the world.Indeed if your purpose is that your lion looks real, you can't expand the range of facial expressions: remember in ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" the way Pongo and Perdita looked at each other at the end of the garden scene: reproducing that with real-looking animals is inconceivable, couldn't work, wouldn't work. And that's the ultimate wager of photorealistic remakes: achieve documentary-like realism with storylines that were designed for hand-drawn or at the very least CGI animation, ""Toy Story"" CGI I mean.And that leads to even more perplexing results when it comes to 'surreal' sequences like ""I Just Can't Wait to Be The King"" where two normal-looking cubs are casually running across pink flamingoes, or the moment that precedes Simba's epiphany where the figure of Mufasa is barely visible in the sky (not to mention that some lines were cut from the original). Now, maybe Disney takes for granted our passion for the ""Lion King"" and considers that we're there to ""fill the gaps"". It's true I did enjoy the film to the degree that it reminded of ""The Lion King"", which is a high point of my childhood, but at the end of the day, my mind was full of afterthoughts. To put it simple, I realized it was an enjoyment by proxy.The problem of ""The Lion King"" isn't that it's good or bad. It is certainly a remarkable achievement on the field of animation. The problem is that it is problematic. Yes I'm talking in circles but that's a circle Disney has just taken us into and that makes it rather impossible to figure what is wrong with these photorealistic films, we know there's something that doesn't look right, maybe on a pure reason-to-be way.""The Lion King"" is one of the classics of animation, a masterpiece that speaks highhy of the dedication of old-school Disney team of animators. 1995 would change the games with the first CGI and so in a way, ""The Lion King"" was the culmination of that traditional hand-drawn art. Not only that but its story, very simple and straightforward carried the gravitas and dramas or movie classics. Characters like Scar, Mufasa, Simba are all printed in our memories, the songs became pop culture monuments, scenes have been parodied countless times. ""The Lion King"" became a household name for Disney excellence. And certainly one of the greatest opening sequences of history, the shivers down your spine sent by the sight of Rafiki carrying little Simba is one of these moments you can't just 'duplicate'.As viewers pointed out, many things are missing: where is the friendly nod Mufasa gives Zazu? Or that hug between Rafiki and Mufasa? Mufasa comes across as a stone-faced patriarch posing like a library statue... and waiting for our nostalgic pheromones to instill some life in him .... Maybe we were just curious to see how they'd pull this out. I guess if I was told about an animated version of ""The Godfather"" no matter how ludricrous it sounds I would have given a shot. ""The Lion King"" was such a big deal, viewers did came to see and made it one of the highest grossing films of the year.Fair enough, but what's that does say exactly? That half the job was done and make a copy of something great to make something of equally promising greatness? The purpose of a remake is to bring something new. But ""The Lion King 2019"" doesn't bring anything new except for the realistic animation that doesn't look like an improvement anyway.. Scar looks like a washed out lion who shampooed his mane with paint thinner, without one tenth the suave charisma of the original. James Earl Jones' voice looks like he was only testing the microphone or was bored to death, which actually matched the look of the used-to-be majestic lion.And I swear the savannah and jungle never looked so dismal with tones of beige and yellowish green that reminded me of that Water Truce sequence in ""The Jungle Book"". So much for the bright colors and the escapism.... And the only thing visible right now are the thorns on the head, and the round ears have turned pointy... no it's not the devil, but a cow, a cash-cow.~ElMaruecan82 rated 6/10 on 23 April 2022"," If Anything, It's a Monumental Technical Achievement: As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.~DJKwa rated 7/10 on 12 July 2019"," No reason: Why? Stop with your greed Disney, give us new ideas, not a worst version of the old ones~docasesteves rated 9/10 on 13 July 2019"," Falls Short: I just got out of the Lion KingAnd I have to say it falls short of delivering for me. Elements of this new version are spectacular because of the quality of animation... But so much else was just mediocre... Starting with the poor voice talent. My favorite animated movies are brought to life by memorable distinctive voices... I loved what Burt Reynolds brought to All Dogs Go To Heaven, then Robin Williams set the bar with Aladdin, then we have Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers, then Eddie Murphy... The list is long but those films wouldn't have been the same without those voices. This new Lion King film has none of that... it's all just so flat.About 80% of this, is shot for shot/word for word the same as the 1994 classic. Although there is a subplot involving Scar and Sarabi from the Broadway show inserted.My next issue was the soundtrack... Again, there is nothing special here. The 1994 soundtrack was one of the all-time best. I hated Beyoncé singing Can You Feel The Love Tonight. I am not a fan of hers anyway, and her appeal is totally lost on me, but I can acknowledge when she is good as in Goldmember.Finally, and my biggest issue... The realistic non-expressions of the animals. Because you can't see happy or sad in their faces, you fully depend on the mediocre delivery of dialog. This was very distracting. The lion's faces do not show sad... happy... scared. This was like watching a two hour voice over.I found it less entertaining and engrossing than Aladdin and Dumbo, although at times I did enjoy this movie. I can safely say I will never watch it again, and will stick with my 1994 classic, So for me, this was just a mediocre unnecessary remake while showcasing perhaps the greatBest animation ever.~slightlymad22 rated 6/10 on 26 July 2019"," Great movie: The lion king is propably the best live action disney movie. cgi, soundtrack character's voice they're all great.

I've always loved the claymation of Aardman. 'Creature Comforts' and 'Wallace and Gromit' are among many of my favorites. Aardman Studios have come up with a brilliant cast, a funny and smart script, fine cinematography and production design. The inspiration of films like 'The Great Escape' shows. The female characters are so strong and yet they have their own sense of humour and Brit-wit. Aardman's claymation is splendid. The large eyes, body size and shape and movements create this a unique class of comedy. The writing is very sharp and crisp but I disliked the obvious symbolism (of British and America joining hands to save the world and fight evil) which looked a little forced. I don't see the need to make the Rocky character an American rooster (as if it's an ingredient to have an American on board). Yet, that does not take away the sheer pleasure and entertainment one derives from the film. The voice cast is suitably chosen. Gibson plays the typical hero with charisma but it's the Brit cast, which includes names like Imelda Staunton, Lynn Ferguson, Jane Horrocks and Julia Sawalha that did it for me. Their sharp witty humour and strong will just put them on a league of their own. 'Chicken Run' is a cute, heartwarming, uplifting and hilarious little film. To quote another user, it is eggcellent!~Chrysanthepop rated NA on 28 February 2008"," Son of a gun, ""Chicken Run"" is pure fun!: After watching ""Chicken Run,"" you will become a believer of many things.You will believe that a bunch of talking hens wearing beads and bandanas can speak with British and Scottish accents, practice martial arts, escape from inside a pie machine and secretly plot their getaway from an egg farm in 1955 England. You will believe that chickens can knit, dance, wear glasses and play the harmonica.  You will believe that rats can wear bad suits and have an obsession for eggs. You will believe that roosters can fly airplanes, ride a tricycle and sing  ""The Wanderer.""Most importantly, you will believe that the otherwise Disney-choked world of animated films has life again, and that a tiny British studio can top the big boys from Japan and the U.S. and turn out the smartest, possibly best work of this genre ever.  The one point of light in an otherwise lousy summer movie season, ""Chicken Run"" is something you'll want to watch over and over again. You could sit through it 31 times (like yours truly) and it never gets boring. The audienced applauded at the end during my first 13 viewings.Aardman Studios has concocted a recipe consisting of a wonderful (albeit portly and feathered) cast, a funny, intelligent script, a gripping score, excellent cinematography and production design, plus great voice work, all mixed with years of labor and love, and the result is what is easily the best film of 2000. When was the last time you saw a movie with a cast  nearly all-female, no less  so determined and believable in their mission for freedom, and whom you cared so strongly about that you were actually cheering for them to be successful?""Chicken Run"" may be the first animated film that is an absolute joy for both children and adults. Children will be tickled by the jocularity of these hens, while adults will find pleasure in discovering homages to classic prison films  ""The Great Escape,"" ""Stalag 17"" and even ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" among others.Screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick has come up with a sharp script, which has all but become a lost art in the movie world these days.  The dialogue is loaded with puns that work so well.  The British slang is a delight, and makes the chickens' personalities more endearing and  dare I say it  human.One of the best lines comes from Mrs. Tweedy talking lovingly about her soon-to-be chicken pie enterprise. When Mr. Tweedy asks why she only will be included in the brand name, her reply is: ""Woman's touch. Makes the public feel more comfortable.""  The other is Fowler's immortal ""Pushy Americans, always showing up late for every war."" That's simply brilliant writing.The flawless (yes, flawless) voice cast is the heart of this movie. This is one of those rare films in which both the heroes and the villains are fun to watch. You'll find yourself thinking during the end credits, ""I liked this character the bestno, wait a minute, I think I like this one moreno, no, I like that one.""Leading the way is Julia Sawalha, playing another character with a spicy name (from ""AbFab's"" Saffy to CR's Ginger), and providing the ideal heroine we moviegoers have yearned for so long. She's so convincing in this role; you're deeply immensed in Ginger's quest for free range living that you forget she's a Plasticine chicken.It's safe to say that 2000 has been the summer of one Melvin Gibson. He doesn't disappoint with ""The Patriot"" or with his role as Rocky, the vagabond flying rooster (listen to his hysterical rendition of Dion's ""The Wanderer""), who easily bested his squirrel namesake at the box office. The film pokes fun at him in a good-natured way, from his opening ""Braveheart"" gag to his nationality.Rounding out the supporting cast is Lynn Ferguson as the genius Mac, she of the wild hen's comb and odd spectacles.  Jane Horrocks is a show-stopper as the innocent yetwell, bubbleheaded, knitter Babs.  She doesn't have much dialogue, but definitely does the most with the least as she delivers the funniest lines in the movie with aplomb.  Perhaps the film's most famous line is when she bawls ""I don't want to be a pie!"" Why? ""I don't like gravy.""Ben Whitrow's Fowler, the old military rooster, had me in stitches with his constant rambling about his glory days in the Royal Air Force.  Seriously, wouldn't we all want to be awakened by a rooster who hollers, ""Cock-a-doodle-doo, what what""?Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels are a hoot as Nick and Fetcher, the Laurel & Hardy-style farm rats. Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson (not straying very far from her ""evil wife"" role in ""Sleepy Hollow"") are perfect as Willard and Melisha Tweedy, the cruel owners of the prison camper, egg farm. The loving couple is an evil version of American Gothic rendered in clay. Mrs. Tweedy is the best animated villain since Maleficent from ""Sleeping Beauty.""But my favorite (and this was a tough choice) was Imelda Staunton as the brusque, oversized and argumentative, yet lovable, Bunty. She was the character I related to most because my personality is sometimes like hersI think I may have finally found my role model! My favorite part in the film was watching Bunty getting down to ""Flip Flop and Fly.""The ending contains the most thrilling action sequence I've seen all year. I won't dare describe it herego and experience the magic for yourself.  What I will say is that I haven't had this much side-splitting fun with an ending since ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""I haven't enjoyed a film like this since ""Sleepy Hollow"" was released 7 months earlierneedless to say, this has been a period of movie ecstasy that is as rare as hens' teeth, so to speak.  I'm sure nobody will care, but what I found interesting about ""Chicken Run"" was that it bore a striking resemblance to SH in terms of the plot: a small citizenry, kept prisoner by a villain who has a fetish for decapitation, pins their hopes of freedom on an outsider who is brash and sure of himself on the outside, yet soft and bewildered on the inside.  Both movies are in my personal top 10 of all time.After watching this, I dare anyone to find another movie that is as heartwarming, witty, suspenseful and funny as ""Chicken Run."" To those who feel the need to criticize this film for any reasonI deeply sympathize with your lack of soul. 10/10~SwingBatta rated 10/10 on 22 August 2000"," I prefer stop motion than CGI .: This movie was great .Directed by Nick Park ,the creator of ""Wallace and Gromit "" and ""Creature Comforts "" made a funny ,clever and wonderfully animated .

Meanwhile ,I liked a lot this movie as much as the movie of Wallace and Gromit , that have more heart and life than the recent 3D animated movies .~Rectangular_businessman rated 9/10 on 10 March 2007"," Wonderful Animation Packed with Intertexts: Watching Peter Lord and Nick Park's glorious animation story of a group of chickens escaping from a repressive farm in 1950s Britain, one comes to understand how the script draws on a whole raft of classic war films of the period, including THE COLDITZ STORY (1955), STALAG 17 (1953), and most obviously THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963).All of the elements are there, treated with a tongue-in-cheek reverence that makes the film a memorable experience. Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is the lead chicken, desperately trying to devise escape plans from the farm policed by Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) and his shrewish spouse (Miranda Richardson). The need to escape is paramount; all the chickens have to hope for instead is a life dedicated to laying eggs and a violent death by strangulation, as the Tweedies cook yet another tasty Sunday dinner. The only problem is that Ginger's task is hampered by the well-meaning yet rather clueless inmates, led by Babs (Jane Horrocks) and Mac (Lynn Ferguson). The entire group are 'supervised' (?) by the Brigadier Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), using the kind of Fifties Received Pronunciation accent that immediately recalls the war films of that period.Enter Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson), a self-assured refugee from the circus, with a cockiness (pun intended) recalling Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Although eventually helping to create a successful escape, Rocky has to learn how to co-exist with a group of Brits, that requires both races to become more accommodating, and less xenophobic. The script allows for some jokes familiar to viewers acquainted with World War II history (all Americans are ""overpaid, oversexed, and over here.""Although only just over eighty minutes long, the film is packed with incident as well as some really funny jokes. CHICKEN RUN is a joyous experience, a tribute both to the talents of animators and script-writers alike.~l_rawjalaurence rated 8/10 on 30 December 2014"," Escape or Die Frying.: I wasn't very excited about watching ''Chicken Run'' in the beginning. A friend of mine, Aluísio, told me the story was good and worthwhile, so, since I have the movie in my house I decided to watch it to see if it was really nice.It is not my favorite animation, but the movie is quite good actually!Until I saw the credits running, I would never say that Mel Gibson was Rocky's voice. And I found the characters very, very expressive,specially in their facial expressions.It was funny to see a reference to Braveheart in this movie, since I watched Mel Gibson's performance as William Wallace yesterday. (When Rocky says he's from ""The land of the free, the home of the brave"", Mac immediately says, ""Scotland!"" This is a reference to the Mel Gibson-directed film Braveheart)The plot of the story is simple: The chicken from Tweedy's farm are horrified with the idea of becoming the next meal of the day. Ginger, the leader of all chickens,with the help of Mac, is always trying to scape from the farm with her ideas and plans. One day, she met Rocky, a rooster that apparently can fly and is escaping from his circus ' owner. They make a deal and she agrees to hide him if he helps all of the chickens to escape. Their relationship starts to progress, but the art of flying doesn't. And Mrs Twwedy starts to have more and more strange ideas of what to do with the chickens and make her profits higher...aka ""A Fuga das Galinhas"" - Brazil~Lady_Targaryen rated 7/10 on 17 March 2006"," Another kind of chick flick!: Disney and Pixar held such a firm grip on animation that somehow our expectations seem to have been conditioned by their standards. This is why enjoying a Hayao Miyazaki film or anything outside the 'Dream Factory' is capital to prevent a certain creative monopoly... for the sake of creativity itself. And to call ""Chicken Run"" creative is an understatement.I have never been into claymation or stop-motion, ""Wallace and Gromit"" are household names but I'm not sure I ever watched any of their cartoons, but I admire the legacy, the patience with which Nick Park and Peter Lord gave life to these characters with unmistakable ovoid smile. They made their own style like Parker and Stone did with ""South Park"", animation starts with style, guts, a touch of zaniness and... a good story. Park and Lord designed it, Karey Kirkpatrick wrote the screenplay.In 1995, having made names of themselves with two Oscars for Best Animated Shorts, the duo figured it was time to join the big league. After four years, was released ""Chicken Run"", a tale of chicken trying to escape from a big farm designed like a German POW camp with undertones that recall the darkest chapters of history. That the film maintain a jolly and goofy attitude is admirable because never the gags (and there are plenty of them) conceal what's in jeopardy here; not just freedom but survival.In what might be the film's most disturbing scene, hens are aligned in the manner of prisoners waiting for the Kommandantur officer to give his orders and then a tall and thin woman almost goose-stepping with long and ominous black boots, checks her notebook and finds that one of her hens hasn't laid eggs in five days. There's a strange contrast between the poor hen's cartoonish gulp and the following scene where Mrs. Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson) becomes the executioner.That scene doesn't set the tone as much as the stakes. The opening credits treated the heroine's failing escape attempts as a 'running gag' (no pun intended) ending with her being thrown in solitary (a funny nod to ""The Great Escape"" shows her playing with a Brussels sprout like Steve McQueen's baseball) but when the poor hen is killed off-screen -we do hear the thud and we see the raising axe- we understand that it's a matter of life and death and these hens' lives hang on their capability to lay eggs, in fact, on economical viability to the money-driven owner.Later she'd rent a new machine designed to make automated pies to increase her profits and so eggs will lose their life values. I guess one who had visited a farm or these industrial complexes where animals are mechanically stuffed and killed, won't find the historical parallels too far-fetched. Park and Lord humanized the hens and gave each one distinct personalities. It's perhaps the one concession to formula that had to be made, but it works. You know you have a leader, a brainiac, a reluctant one and a goofball in a community, but to call these hens archetypal would really diminish the effort pulled in the writing. At the very least they're war film archetypes not cute animated characters.Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is the intrepid leader and the embodiment of ""getting free or die trying"", she's the voice of reason and her heroism leaves no doubt since her failing escapes are collective, if it was up to her, she would have been free already. She is supported by Mac, the scientific one (and ever since I watched that ""What's My Line"" episode, I know chicken can wear glasses), there's the most productive one Bunty (Imelda Stanton) whose skepticism is never overplayed, I actually loved her retort to Ginger's , ""what haven't we tried before?"" ""we haven't tried not trying to escape"" and there's Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), an elderly rooster who keeps rambling about his experience at the RAF and youth's lack of discipline. And there's Babs (Jane Horrocks), the dim-witted champion knitter, one of these you can't help thinking 'God I wish nothing happens to her"".It's interesting that the film is mostly an all-female cast where even the villain 'Mrs Tweedy"" illustrates a sort of female power by being so dominant on her hen-pecked (literally) husband Mr Tweedy (Tony Haygart). Female characters are so prevalent that there had to be a reverse 'Smurfette effect', besides the two helpful rats (Phil Daniels and Timothy Spall). There's where the cocky (literally) Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a rooster with flying powers (so it seems) crashes into the farm. One can imagine how a rooster would feel surrounded by so many groupies, but Ginger has no time for courting, she offers him a shelter in exchange of flying lessons. It's not much the training session or Rocky's morale-boosting actions but his hidden flaws that make him such an endearing character. In a funny coincidence, the same year Gibson played a similar role in ""What Women Want"". Rocky knows what hens want but will he live up to his premise?As the plot advances, we understand that heroism is a dish often served with a share of bluff and the two roosters in fact have their shameful secrets. ""Chicken Run"" never runs out of ideas and gratifies us with great moments: a dancing party, hens trying to hide from Mr. Tweedy, and a spectacular climax. One of the film's greatest momentums is the trip inside the infernal pie-making contraption with some clever nods to Indiana Jones. And just imagine that the creators made four seconds of the film each day, just as if the hens dug a tunnel with toothpicks.It's a credit to the authors to have made a film with such dark undertones so fun. It is mature but never at the expenses of entertainment. And hens are so believable as characters that we cheer for them not because we're required so but because we want to.~ElMaruecan82 rated 9/10 on 5 December 2022"," Animation at its best, with outstanding characters and a clever story. ***1/2 (out of four): CHICKEN RUN / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)	""Chicken Run,"" DreamWorks Picture's newest animation festival, is an old-fashioned fairy tale with more heart and truth than most movies can even imagine about containing. The film's animated style contains state-of-the-art clay-animation techniques, which make it worth the trip to the multiplex just for feasting your eyes on such brilliant special effects. Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park, with co-writer Karey Kirkpatrick, give the characters depth, reason, and dimension-even if the main star is a feathered farm animal that converges with his companions about political matters. 	""Chicken Run"" details the miserable lives of a clan of chickens being withheld within a sinister dairy farm in 1950's England. Ginger (voiced by Miranda Richardson) is the central character, who, along with her acquaintances, deeply lust for the sweet smell of freedom that lies beyond the constricting boundaries of their pens. The unhappy farm owners, the smart and devious Mrs. Tweedy and the dumb and precarious Mr. Tweedy, brutally dispose of chickens who fail to produce the amount of eggs they require.  	When a overzealous circus Rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) stumbles onto the farm one evening, the other chickens blackmail him into teaching them how to escape. This is also when the Tweetys lurch up a devilish new plan to strike it rich by purchasing a machine that will turn innocent chickens into merchandising pot pies. 	The film's plot is steady, solid, and knowing; it portrays a series of events that gradually build tension eventually inducing an exciting climax that is both conclusive and satisfying. ""Chicken Run"" is a precise piece of filmmaking, an inoffensive family adventure that will entertain audiences of all ages. Regardless of how well crafted it is or how artful the material, the movie is about chickens escaping out of their pen in order to find genuine independence. No, the stakes are not nearly high enough, and with a plot like this, it is only natural for some audiences to expect a shallow, cheap cartoon publicity stunt. However, the filmmakers make this movie feel original, fresh, suspenseful, and involving, regardless if the main characters are chickens with patriotic instincts.~Movie-12 rated 8/10 on 3 August 2000"," Engaging and delightful!: This movie is all you could hope for in summer film fare.  It had action, suspense, romance and a large helping of comedy.  I was predisposed to love the movie, being a great fan of Wallace and Gromit, and the movie lived up to those other award-winning works.  The movie works on every level, and was fun for all ages viewing it.  Even my husband, who disdains children's movies, was truly enjoying himself.  Needless to say, the children loved it, despite one rather gruesome off-screen moment, but that seemed not to matter too much.

""Grass is always greener on the other side and prickly""!~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 19 June 2019"," Eggselant: Hailing from the animation house that brought us such jems as Morph, the Wallace and Gromit series and Rex the Runt, Chicken Run is the first ever feature length claymation ever attempted.Set on a chicken farm in Yorkshire some time in the middle of the century, our plucky (sorry) heroines face a lifetime of hard labor laying for the farmers, and if their performance is not up to par they quite literally face the chop.  Ginger, making her way to the top of the pecking order (sorry again) attempts jailbreak after farcical jailbreak, but success is less than forthcoming.Enter Rocky The Rhode Island Red, (Rocky Rhodes for short, and you can't blame me for that one, the writers came up with it) apparently able to fly, the chickens look to him to help them bust this chicken coup, but Rocky is not what he may appear to be.That's the plot in a nut (egg?) shell, and as you can imagine the subject matter made for perfect ""salutes"" to the classic world war 2 escape movies, references to which abound throughout.  From Ginger tossing a baseball (actually a sprout) in the ""cooler"" (coal bunker), to Fowler's incessant ramblings about his old RAF days.The lead characters are deep and endearing enough for you to care about what happens to them, if a little stereotypical at times.  The interaction between them is fluid and believable, all the more amazing considering that Mel Gibson never even set foot in the same recording studio as the other actors, reading his lines in a studio in America instead.  The supporting cast provide plenty of humour and Mrs. Tweedy substitutes quite nicely for the Nazi camp commandant.The animation is lively and colourful the characters wonderfully expressive in that unmistakable style developed in the Wallace and Gromit shorts, and thanks to the fact the sets are real models there is plenty of scope for dramatic lighting effects.The only real fault I could find in the film was that it just seemed a little too... American at times.  Hollywood's involvement showed through the English setting to some degree, especially as you get to the movie's climax which seems to go a bit overboard, especially compared to the utterly hysterical ending to The Wrong Trousers.  But all in all I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.  Now all we need is a Wallace and Gromit movie.~Gordon McVey rated 9/10 on 12 December 2000"

I won't say what they were, but the last one rhymes with ""fake tricks."" I was in a movie slump, which made me a little apprehensive about ""Sing 2."" Turns out there was no need to be apprehensive at all, this movie was amazing.""Sing 2"" had all the old gang minus the mouse. The movie began with a Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) production with a big time talent scout from Redshore City in the audience. Redshore City is like a suped up Las Vegas. Moon's updated musical version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" wasn't enough to impress the scout, but Moon would not be denied. In his classic hustling fashion he got his theater troupe on the Redshore City stage to secure a full musical, but with one big condition: he'd need Clay Calloway (Bono) in his production. With a new act, a new member, a missing link, and his life on the line, Moon would need a miracle to make it all happen.I don't know why, but I liked ""Sing 2"" even more than ""Sing."" The musical numbers, again, were fantastic and the plot was wonderful. All of the characters are easy to like and the music works with the flow of the movie as well as the feel of the movie. Even though the plot is very similar to part one, enough elements were different to make it fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.~view_and_review rated 9/10 on 25 December 2021"," Delightful: ""Sing 2"" is truly delightful to watch! The characters are cute, the colour palette is vibrant, and the songs are good. It will bring a smile to everyone's faces!~Gordon-11 rated NA on 26 January 2022"," This is a very well done movie that is a perfect follow-up to the first movie with a well thought-out plot and good use of characters: Sing 2 (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows the gang from the first film performing together in the same theatre and not making it big time as they hoped. They decide to pack up and head to Vegas for an audition for a show on the strip. They win the audition but in doing so promised a star for the show who has long since retired. As the gang gets ready for their big act they will need to try and convince a star who has been out of the industry for 15 years to return to performing.This movie is directed by Garth Jennings (Sing) and contains the voices of Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Scarlett Johansson (Avengers), Tara Strong (Power Puff Girls), Jason Schwartzman (Moonrise Kingdom) and Nick Kroll (Sausage Party).The movie starts with a bang with a fantastic rendition of Alice and Wonderland and is brilliant from there. The audition sequence in this is hilarious. The ending show is very well done and fun to watch unfold. They did a great job of not tipping off the final performance to the audience. The song selection is awesome and the portrayal of the characters is excellent. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The storyline unfolds well but predictably and the villain is perfectly intense.Overall this is a very well done movie that is a perfect follow-up to the first movie with a well thought-out plot and good use of characters. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 9/10 on 14 January 2022"," Dream big dreams: First, I thought Sing (2016) was funny and entertaining. It had great voice acting, great characters, good songs, great musical numbers, and pretty animation.So, I wasn't expecting much in the sequel. But, after watching I found it was just as good as the first movie.Sing 2 (2021) was really entertaining. The characters are voiced well by the same great voice cast and I thought they were also funny.There were scenes I didn't expect, and they were funny especially when there are serious moments, then they are surprising.The songs are good, and the voice actors can sing well, along with great choreographed dance numbers. The animation is pretty and has improved since the first movie.I think Illumination animation is really good and they've done great movies, like Despicable Me. The 3rd act was surprising and the final performance is nicely staged with great songs.When the 3rd act starts, I start liking the movie even more while it keeps surprising me with unexpected scenes. I really do suggest watching Sing 2 (2021), but only if you liked the first one.I really think you will laugh and will be really entertained in how it plays out.~Cinema-reviewer321 rated 7/10 on 8 January 2022"," Some great moments: Buster Moon's proteges are playing sell-out shows in Buster's theatre, but he has bigger ambitions. He wants success for them in Redstone City, the centre of shiwbiz despite being refused an audition, he manages to blag his way into a big budget show for them, but paints himself into several corners in the process, not least of which is extreme danger from Mr Crystal, who commissioned the show. So, while production is under way, moves are afoot to find Clay Calloway, the star Buster has promised. The only thing is that no-one has seen Calloway for 15 years...My first reaction was that I've forgotten the characters and why I should care about them. But the opening number was such a firecracker that I was immediately caught up in the main story and its various subplots, and remained so until the end. So I simply offer several thoughts (among many):1. The musical sequences are terrific;2. I loved Nooshy the breakdancing cat, and the whole Johnny dancing subplot;3. I'm not a fan of Bono, but he gave a terrific performance as Clay Calloway;4. Halsey (who?) as Crystal's daughter Porsha was a hoot. I was thinking Lina Lamont;5. There were a number of moments when I choked and my eyes prickled.Recommended.~neil-476 rated 8/10 on 3 February 2022"," Wow! Didn't expect that.: Unbelievably great. Although Sing film series has only one purpose that they perform a great show no matter how difficult situation they are in, I didn't think that it would turn out to be this great. That being said, I'd like to see some other different plots. Still, it's so much fun and in my opinion, it's better than the first one. I had a great time with this film.~XueHuaBingYu rated 7/10 on 11 January 2022"," Well worth singing about: The first 'Sing' was very enjoyable, despite one annoying character (Mike), the predictability and trying to do too much it was also wonderfully animated with equally wonderful music and mostly successful in writing and characters. While the advertising looked good and trusted friends were raving about 'Sing 2', there was a little apprehension as animated sequels are often badly executed and pointless ('The Secret of NIMH 2 for example) though there are some exceptions like 'Shrek 2' and the second and third 'Toy Story' films.'Sing 2' turned out to be every bit as charming, as entertaining and as delightful as the first, and to me it was actually even better. It has all the first film's good things executed even better, while having richer character development and writing. It also seemed took on board the common criticisms the first had of having too many characters and too much going on, while with plenty going on. It is also more straightforward and there were no pointless or annoying characters here. Mike doesn't appear here and he is not missed.It may be lacking in the originality and momentum dips a little with the Meena subplot.Porsha's change of heart is also a little on the rushed side.However, the animation is wonderful, it's bright, colourful, rich in detail and with slick character designs with more imaginative visuals in the musical numbers. Which are absolutely terrific, especially the absolute firecracker that is the opening. ""I Still Haven't Found What I Am Looking For"" is going to stick in the memory for a long time and reduced me to tears. The character writing is richer, especially for Johnny (still relatable, more so) and even more so Calloway, the most interesting character and also a realistic and easy to identify with one. Porsha is also an absolute hoot and Crystal is a villain (Illumination's best, darkest and most realistic villain by some considerable distance) that absolutely nobody wants to mess with or get on the wrong side of.Furthermore, 'Sing 2' is superior in the writing. A lot of moments induced a lot of loud out loud laughter (ie. The auditions, Miss Crawley's encounter with Calloway), others brought a tear to the eyes (Calloway walking down the stairs with only Ash's singing being heard) and there was plenty of uplifting hope in the absolutely spectacular final act, which made the writing feel very feel good. The story is predictable, but the energy is truly infectious and razor sharp without feeling rushed. Like the character writing, the storytelling is richer emotionally and has a good deal more depth. Notably the whole Calloway storyline. Of the character relationships, faring best are the scary tension between Buster and Crystal, Johnny and super cool Nooshi and the tender, heartfelt one between Ash and Calloway.All the voice acting is spot on as well and the singing performances are exemplary, all the original voice actors return and have lost none of what made them so good in the first. Bono's casting was truly genius and he brought a lot of amusement and heart to Calloway. Bobby Cannavale is often truly unnerving as Crystal, especially when the character's ruthlessness darkens and becomes more dangerous without ever being too overkill. Halsey's quirkiness is truly adorable and entertaining.Concluding, so much better than expected and very well done. 8/10.~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 2 August 2023"," Great entertainment for the big kids: This was amazing. Some great songs and performances. This will appeal to big kids and little kids too. Humour on a number of levels. Check it out. Bono has a great role and this is a thoughtful and well written ""kids "" film.~singhlall rated 8/10 on 16 February 2022"," Perfect way to end the year.: It's not often that a sequel is actually better than the original, but I can certainly say that that was the case here, Sing 2 came out of nowhere and was an incredible surprise.You might not know this, but Matthew McConaughey is one of my absolute favorite actors ever, and he's one of the the reason I love these films so much, he carries all of them.The first sing was awesome, and Interstellar was gorgeous, he was perfect in Interstellar and smashed it here.Johnny and Meena get much better character work than the previous film, and I was so happy when his dad appeared.Sing 2 also features some of my favorite songs ever, they need to release a sing-along version.This animation is spectacular, just like the first one, that ending sequence is breathtaking, and Sing 2 is extremely funny.Whoever got rock star Bono here deserves an award or something, perfect casting choice, he plays a very damaged character, and when he started performing it was amazing.Sing 2 is a better, funnier, realer version of the first one.A+.Perfect way to end the year.~mrashtastic89 rated 10/10 on 30 December 2021"," Really great film, computer animation has come a long way: This was better than the first one but also just the animation - man, it's amazing. When he comes out of the water, the wet fur, the stuff they're doing today is incredible, it looks so real. The whole city, the anamorphic animals, it's hard to believe it's animation. Just incredible work, beautiful colors and so much detail, there will be times you will want to pause to see everything. The work here is something to be appreciated.Plus watch the little details, when a character moves an eye or a hand, little gestures, so much work was put into everything. The movement of the characters is just spectacular in every way.But the script is great and one of the best cast animated films for sure. Everyone was great. The music was great, the direction was wonderful. Honestly, I love good computer animated films and there are some that have great animation but a boring script or visa versa but this has everything. I think this will go down as a minor classic. Just a wonderful film.I would love to transport myself from 30 years ago to today and watch this and see how amazed I'd be.

Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town"". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! 10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 19 July 2002"," Wonderfully imaginative animation, fun & intelligent songs make for a great family film for all but the youngest children: Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King  the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier.~bob the moo rated NA on 2 November 2004"," One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchable: I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.  A+~Quinoa1984 rated 10/10 on 14 December 2003"," Burton's ""Nightmare"" is a dream come true: By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say ""weird,"" I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample ""esque"" qualities that make this ""Nightmare"" uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, ""Burton""-esque village of ""Halloweentown,"" Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another ""horrible"" Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of ""Christmastown."" Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique ""esque"" vision after the other, especially with the first two ""Batman"" films and ""Edward Scissorhands"" behind him as of '93 when ""Nightmare"" was made.10/10~dee.reid rated 10/10 on 10 December 2004"," Textbook example proving the old adage, ""The grass is always greener in someone else's yard."": This film, while far from Burton's masterpiece, is a delightful musical that in the end shows that, sometimes, we have things far better than we think we do and the other side of the fence sometimes looks better just because it's different, but that doesn't make necessarily wise to pursue someone else's dream because we mistakenly think we may like it more.  Tim Burton's fingerprints are all over this film.  Excellent casting of vocal talent, the score is great and the animation is marvelous.  A very good film and worth watching more than once.  Recommended.~llltdesq rated 10/10 on 15 November 2000"," An animated classic? I think so!: I admit it, I really like Tim Burton. I know his films are very oddball, but he has a wide imagination and his films are visually amazing. And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 20 December 2009"," Finally Decided to Watch It: This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced.~Hitchcoc rated 9/10 on 7 September 2017"," One of the most memorable holiday classics of all time. A visual masterpiece. ***1/2 out of ****.: THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).	Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.	The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.	We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.  Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures.~Movie-12 rated 9/10 on 14 March 2000"," Artfully combines two very different holidays: Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."" You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.~AlsExGal rated 9/10 on 19 October 2010"," A true must see for all Halloween fans: I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie, the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moore that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King, depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman Sally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" and give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will have to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What's this?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just' right show this fact.~CheshireCatsGrin rated 10/10 on 12 December 2004"

They're very distinct (not that surprising, seeing as they are different elements), and memorable; their love story is also told brilliantly. The relationship between the female lead and her father is also poignant, and drives the story and the decisions she takes, which ultimately provides a brilliant story arc for her character.The animation of Elemental is rich and vibrant. The score is also great.Elemental is sweet, funny and heartfelt (it drew a tear from me).8.5-9/10.~exceladeogun rated 9/10 on 16 August 2023"," Elemental does lend itself to comparisons with Inside Out and Zootopia, but as a smaller scale film it has solid heart in spite of some rough spots.: In a world where beings of fire, water, air, and earth exist, Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis) is a first generation fire elemental and daughter of immigrants Bernie and Cinder (Ronnie del Carmen and Shila Ommi respectively) who emigrated to Element City facing prejudice and systemic segregation to start a bodega, called The Fireplace, that is the unofficial hub of Firetown which Bernie hopes Ember will someday inherit. Ember routinely struggles to keep her temper with customers and during one such episode inadvertently damages an old water pipe which pulls in city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie) from the other side of town and must reluctantly issue several citations on the bodega. After learning of Ember's struggles with trying to takeover The Fireplace from her ailing father, Wade feeling guilty over it tries to help Ember save The Fireplace as well as find out why there is water still running through Firetown when it shouldn't and eventually a romance blooms in spite of the historic incompatibility with fire and water.Elemental is the latest film from Pixar and comes to us from director Peter Sohn who based the initial idea off his immigrant parents and based the underlying concept around the relationship between fire and water. The film was primarily based off of the structure of romantic comedies and dramas such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Big Sick while also building those ideas around the core elemental one. In terms of execution Elemental does have some of the same issues of Sohn's The Good Dinosaur, but it is a nice light romance with a solid presentation of its core themes.I'll start off by saying the opening scenes where we establish Element City and the characters of Bernie and Cinder are really good as we see them rejected by several prospective renters as despite Element City's history of welcoming immigrants as per the murals on the harbor, the fire elementals being the newest entrants to society are very much treated with hostility and prejudice. This sequence continues onward with the Lumen's eventually buying a neglected building an refurbishing it as their bodega and overtime it becoming the central point of Firetown. The animation used to bring the elementals and their world to life is nicely done as there's a lot of great details in the textures and movements of the characters with the distortions of water and the movement of fire and while on occasion the world building can seem a little spotty and doesn't feel as fully realized as Zootopia's, it does a good job of addressing systemic racism in communities. Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie are both really solid as Ember and Wade and their interactions with each other are complemented with some cute moments and amusing exchanges. I also rather liked the relationship with Ember and her father Bernie played by Ronnie del Carmen that while sweet does a good job of setting up the wedge issue.While I think Elemental has good pieces in place, I did feel like some parts of the film felt underdeveloped especially in regards to a leak in Firetown responsible for the water seeping in that doesn't feel all that interesting and I felt like from a world building perspective it opened up some questions that the movie didn't really address. While Elemental has no villain in it, this is the kind of plot point that feels like it could've used a villain be it an unscrupulous developer or a construction firm rigging bids to add that little extra ""something"" that's missing from this plot point because it's a pretty big one and its not all that fleshed out.I liked Elemental for the things that did genuinely work even if it stands in the shadows of others who've covered similar material. I think this is a much better project from Peter Sohn in comparison to The Good Dinosaur even if like that film there are still some flubs in the presentation of the central idea even if not to the extent The Good Dinosaur had them. But contrary to what people have said, this is not one of Pixar's worst movies especially when you consider the Cars trilogy and Lightyear exist.~IonicBreezeMachine rated 7/10 on 20 June 2023"," I sorta understand the hate but it's a lot better than Buzzlightyear!: I loved the colors so much, the charm, and great feel good vibes! Sure a lot goes wrong a lot like Buzzlightyear but it's way more satisfying and has lovely romance. To me it's one of the best kids movies I've seen this year besides Into the Spider-verse. I was a bit nauseas in the last half and been tired all day and still loved this a lot especially with the wonderful music makes everything so sweet. I'm not fully sure why people bashed this besides the amount that goes wrong it's well acted and wholesome with great diversity mashed in perfectly throughout. I was even late to getting a ticket and a sweet family let me have the spot the they had so the mom could sit with her kids, always magnificent when most the audience claps afterwards too.~UniqueParticle rated 8/10 on 25 June 2023"," Too familiar, but a story well-told.: Elemental has several obvious glaring problems. For one thing, the attempt to make the elements' differences an overt metaphor for race/culture is shallow and misplaced at best most of the time.The story's themes and plot itself are about as worn-out and tired as the art of the story itself. Not a single new idea is really explored at this level.And, at the more surface level, the film's visuals vary greatly in quality: the environments are gorgeous, colorful, and vibrant, while the character designs appear haphazard, thrown together, and honestly kind of ugly.But where this film shines-and I mean REALLY shines, surprisingly-is in the writing of its characters.Ember and Wade are instantly distinct, understood, and likeable. They both grow tremendously and at a consistent pace. They are 110% the reason to see this film. I got emotionally wrapped up in their lives and desires in a way that I've only felt in Pixar's best films. This is the sole great achievement of Elemental.The one other thing I can praise is the sound design and the musical score-both of which are largely powerful and memorable.Maybe it's that my expectations were on the floor going into this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Maybe wait to catch it on streaming, but don't write it off completely.~benjaminskylerhill rated 6/10 on 16 June 2023"," Overall, I really did enjoy it.: Visually the animation was really good. Literally Elemental was brilliant to watch. Also, have to admit that I was not expecting much from a movie about fire and water falling in love. Disney has always made movies for children in which they teach them to do whatever their heart desire through the story of a creature or an object that really should not or can't change it spots. Now they've picked the elements.Elemental has more in-depth story about Immigrants I was not expecting in a Disney/Pixar movie. It was not hidden at all. Neither was the romance between fire and Ice which I was very different for these movies.It was so different from what I expected, and it was refreshing.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 19 June 2023"," ""Shasharisha!"": While very simplistic and predictable at all points, it is rather ""cute"".It handles its emotional core very well, with the characterizations and voice-acting being the best part (as well as the excellent vibrant worldbuilding).. but the content is so sparse it makes the pacing feel sluggish and the film a tad long. As a romance, it's okay and delivers on its premise! The other layers, like the ""looming threat"", are a second-thought and a mark that needed to be checked.As a Pixar movie and after 7 years of development? I'm not sure.. I guess I expected more from the narrative. Had this been done by a smaller and newer studio, I can imagine only praises. Maybe just say the smaller division did it!Sadly, this is a perfect movie for streaming.~daisukereds rated 6/10 on 14 August 2023"," Romantic: This is the Pixar I know. I knew what kind of a story Elemental was going to be. From the IMDb plot and the reviews, I knew the cliches it would have and the route it will take. But this movie still really touched me.I was really surprised by how well they executed the romance. And I'm surprised by the fact that Pixar made just a love story. I knew there was going to be romance in this but I thought, like most pixar movies, the main theme of this movie would be something else and the romance would progress on the sidelines. But no, the romance takes center stage in this film.The main character, Ember, was very well written. She was likeable, relatable, and we as viewers experienced the entire story through her perspective. In comparison to Ember though, the side characters aren't as well explored as she is and that's the aspect of the movie that could've been a bit better.But the romance is very good, honestly. It doesn't fit at first and feels a bit forced initially. That's why the 1st act of the movie isn't really as engaging. But the romance is paced perfectly. Because when these 2 characters started understanding more and more about each other, I started to really root for them and that's when this movie started to get really good. Amd the conclusion of the movie is very satisfying because of how well the romance is executed. The soundtrack too was very catchy and it worked perfectly with some specific moments of the film.The theme though is cliche and it could have been done better. And the character of wade too could have been explored a bit more.But in the end, I had a really nice time with this movie. You know, when a character is crying, and you just can't help but feel like crying yourself, that's when you know the movie has done its job.Pixar had lost its way lately, but this film might get them back on track. This was a very sweet and wonderfully executed romance.~talking_about_movies rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," some fundamental issues but great overall: This world consists of Elements, the different races of nature. Element City has been allowing immigration of each elemental races over the years. The newest immigrant wave is the Fire Element. Bernie and Cinder Lumen are new to the city. They find the city ill-fitting to them or downright hostile. They get damaged by the Water Elements. They burn wood which only raises the ire of the Earth Elements. The Air Elements look down on them. Finally, they find a home in an abandoned house and start a store called The Fireplace. The Fire neighborhood grow out around them and they have a girl named Ember. Ember grows up and Bernie allows her to run The Fireplace for the day. It's going badly and it gets worst when Water Element city inspector Wade Ripple shows up.This is the standard immigrant story. It is so elemental that it hits you over the head with it. I wouldn't mind that but it leaves this world a little problematic. I just don't know why or how the Fire Element could coexist with the other Elements. It's a weird construction. I guess that's the point. This world is not built for them and yet they thrive somehow. Instead of creating something new, it's trying too hard to be a version of a human city. There are ways to make this more logically and compelling. In the end, one has to take this world as a given. I do really like the design of the Fire Elements. This is not top tier Pixar, but it looks really good and the story works well as long as one does not dissect this world apart.~SnoopyStyle rated 7/10 on 30 August 2023"," Elemental: Pixar's latest film is a celebration of family, love, and diversity: Elemental is a new animated film from Pixar that takes place in a divided city where residents of all four elements live together: fire, water, earth, and air. The main characters are two young women Ember and Wade.The film's story is simple but effective. Ember is an energetic and passionate fire being who makes her living lighting fires. Wade, on the other hand, is a calm and cautious water being.Is also full of humor, heart, and important messages. Ember and Wade show us that even people from seemingly different worlds can fall in love and become friends. The film also shows that it is important to overcome prejudice and work together in order to live in peace.The film's animation is simply stunning. The filmmakers created a vibrant and colorful world that is full of detail. The characters are original and likable.Elemental is a great animated film that will be enjoyed by children and adults alike. It is a film full of love, friendship, family, and beautiful animation.~Aretheu rated 10/10 on 19 November 2023"," The old magic of Pixar returns: The old magic of Pixar returns in this family delight, and I am sad this was not a bigger hit. At the heart of this amazing movie is a timeless love story, of two elementally different individuals seeing the light shining in each other and coming together against all odds. My family and I were swept away by the simple sweetness of this film. Director Peter Sohn has done well.There is also a beautiful father-daughter story interwoven into this film, and as the father of 4 princesses, I can definitely relate. The timeless lesson of letting your kids follow their dreams is retold in a beautiful way, and even more so, the critical importance of parent and child respecting each other.The animation is spectacular, I love how the various elements are represented, and how they interact with each other in various moments. The character design is spot on, and the closer you look the more details emerge. Hats off to how far Pixar animation has come. For some time I thought a 5th unifying element would emerge but that was wishful thinking.Finally, the soundtrack is a real delight, I truly appreciate the South Asian themes as my region of origin. Master composer Thomas Newman took a bold risk weaving in those elements, and it paid off.I have not enjoyed a Pixar movie this much since Coco; they need to stay true to such heartwarming story-telling and inspiring imagination.~tarekali-19909 rated 9/10 on 11 September 2023"

First on our list we saw La La Land and just loved it so we stuck to the musical genre and next on our list was the lighter side of comedy with the animation feature Sing. Neither Mrs. Shullivan or I are fans of 3-D films but this was the only format being offered at 10:00 PM so we went for it. It took me about 15 minutes to adjust to the 3D format even though I have tried it a few times before, and my opinion has not changed. In my opinion the 3D format does not add any value to a film and by the sparse theater crowd I assume most are in agreement with me. Producers have attempted the 3D format for more than 60 years now with little success and I will be glad when the format is abandoned and the editors rely on content quality and not CGI.The film Sing is great and it will appeal to a vast crowd from the age of 3 to 103. After I had adjusted to the 3D format and we got to know the animal characters and the story line I for one just forgot that it was an animated feature and I sat back and watched the film progress in a very positive light. There are some big name stars lending their voices and I am sure they are proud of their finished product.

Buster's late father had worked extremely hard in his car wash across the street from the theater to fulfill Buster's dream to open the theater and Buster needed to pull off the biggest hit of his life if he were to keep his dream theater out of the bankers grasp. Each of the animal characters has a story to tell. Each of the animal characters also has a great voice and a personal life that the winning prize money if they were to win the sing off would take care of. The plot is simple so the children should be able to follow along relatively easy, all the animated animal characters were adorable. There are also some bad guys besides the bankers who want their hands on the prize money, and this just adds more humor and excitement to this cute little animated feature.The songs were great, the story line very heartwarming, and the animated characters were all cute and cuddly.

Sing is quite a different animation film since the basic is about singing. Initially did not expect this film to be great, funny or interesting but upon viewing, there was something different in both style and originality with this film.What makes this film work is not only the singing (there are a blend of older songs and newer ones of different genres) but the different type of characters, and how each main animal character is given a backstory and subplot.For a family/children film it works- the comedy is juvenile, the visuals are nice to look at and it sends a positive message. Exceeded expectations, anticipating Sing 2.~Floated2 rated 8/10 on 27 July 2019"," Sing is the most enjoyable of the musical computer-animated movies we've seen this year!: This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically means just about every character is singing something because it's about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that happen when risks are taken.

I really enjoyed it, and I think most kids will as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc~Hellmant rated 8/10 on 4 January 2017"," Great songs and great characters: I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me chills.I went into this movie expecting lots of songs and gags, and they are there, but I didn't expect to start caring about the characters and their stories. SING brings together a talented cast and writers for a movie that transcends some of the animated movies out there. The whole family loved it so feel free to bring anyone from 5 on up. Even the younger ones may enjoy it when it's available at home.Every voice actor delivers and the animators nailed it. The pacing and directing are also very well done. In fact, I could have done with even more of the ""auditions"" at the beginning.~klchu rated 9/10 on 26 November 2016"," This is a unique and very well done movie. A modern day masterpiece.: Sing (2016) is a movie we went to see in theatres as a family. The storyline follows a struggling theatre that is looking for a way to not go out of business. The owner decides to have a singing competition that receives more auditions, participation and attention than he ever imagined. As it gets closer and closer to show night several participants will have to overcome their inner demons if they hope to deliver the performance of their life.This movie is codirected by Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow) and Christophe Lourdelet in his directorial debut. The voices are provided by Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy), John C. Reilly (Step Brothers) and Jennifer Hudson (Dream Girls).The animation in this picture is excellent and very well done. The characters are brilliantly written and pull at your heart strings the entire movie. The storyline builds up perfectly keeping the audience glued to their seats and unable to be able to wait to see how it ends. The voices are perfectly selected as are the song choices. The ending doesn't disappoint and gives the audience everything it is looking for.This is a unique and very well done movie. A modern day masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 10/10 on 17 February 2022"," Interesting characters, great concept: There have seemingly been a wave a very solid animation movies within the last few years or so. Sing is quite a different animation film since the basic is about singing. Initially did not expect this film to be great, funny or interesting but upon viewing, there was something different in both style and originality with this film.What makes this film work is not only the singing (there are a blend of older songs and newer ones of different genres) but the different type of characters, and how each main animal character is given a backstory and subplot.For a family/children film it works- the comedy is juvenile, the visuals are nice to look at and it sends a positive message. Exceeded expectations, anticipating Sing 2.~Floated2 rated 8/10 on 27 July 2019"," Sing is the most enjoyable of the musical computer-animated movies we've seen this year!: This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically means just about every character is singing something because it's about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that happen when risks are taken. I really don't want to reveal any more so I'll just say that me and my friend highly recommend Sing.~tavm rated 9/10 on 21 December 2016"," lighthearted and inspiring: An immensely enjoyable & likeable animated comedy, Garth Jennings' Sing is extremely entertaining to children and adults. The film may not, however, leave a lasting impression as the tale of a singing competition and its animal competitors does little to stand out. Characters are cute, and voice-talent is strong; but both the narrative and the animation lack depth. Sing is fun, but it rarely hits any high notes.~aminifatimaaa rated 8/10 on 20 May 2019"," Sing, sing, sing sing!: I really enjoyed this film! Great songs with extraordinary voices! And cute characters too, especially the porcupine! Though I will admit, the car wash scene was a little awkward... though my 9 year old daughter thought it was funny! And her favorite part is the pig singing in the super market to the Gypsy Kings! Fun movie - great singing!~donaldricco rated 8/10 on 23 April 2017"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) - IMDb,7.2,Micah Abbey|Shamon Brown Jr.|Nicolas Cantu|Brady Noon|Ayo Edebiri|Maya Rudolph|John Cena|Seth Rogen|Rose Byrne|Natasia Demetriou|Giancarlo Esposito|Jackie Chan|Ice Cube|Paul Rudd|Post Malone|Hannibal Buress|Jimmy Donaldson|Derek Wilson,Jeff Rowe|Kyler Spears,Seth Rogen|Evan Goldberg|Jeff Rowe,The film follows the Turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing down an army of mutants.," Visually appealing, but the story is bland: I didn't hate this movie, but aside from the animation style (I'm loving this new trend of blending traditional and CG-- also, I love how no one was designed to be necessarily cute or appealing save for the turtles) this is a pretty generic kids' movie. The story is honestly a bit of a mess (we have two villains, one of which is only there to set up the inevitable sequel, the other only elevated by Ice Cube's entertaining performance and a creepy character design) and the dialogue is so packed with pop culture references that it became tiresome.As a TMNT outing, the film's biggest flaw is how the turtles all sound the same. The core of the everlasting appeal of the TMNT franchise is the give and take between the four brothers: Leonardo is serious due to his high expectations for himself, Raphael is a hothead with anger issues, Michelangelo loves partying to the detriment of his concentration, and Donatello is a geek who ""does machines,"" to quote the '87 theme song. The best TMNT outings play up these differences, creating both tension and affection among the turtles. Here, these traits are downplayed so all the turtles can be loud, pop culture-spewing kids with ADHD. A lot of people have praised how they feel like ""real teens,"" and yes, some teens are like this, but it ignores that teenagers are not one size fits all in terms of personality.A few good things: while I prefer my Splinters to be wise and mature, Jackie Chan's paranoid Splinter cracked me up consistently. I also liked this new April more than I expected to. I prefer April to be an older sister figure to the turtles as she was in the 1987 and 2003 shows, and in the classic 1990 film. Lately, there seems to be more of a push to have April as a teenage friend/love interest, which I don't often like. I thought that was done well here though and I thought her chemistry with the turtles was excellent, their budding friendship very natural.The group I went with (which included some massive TMNT fans) enjoyed the movie, but I just expect more out of family films these days. With PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH and the SPIDERVERSE films, we deserve family animation with more heart and originality than the likes of MUTANT MAYHEM or THE SUPER MARIO BROS MOVIE, both very attractive films with little else to offer. I still say the 1990 TMNT movie is the definitive big screen take: it had humor, great character dynamics, a gritty NYC aesthetic, and a tense finale. It's a great film that takes itself seriously, even when the filmmakers could have phoned it in and still gotten a hefty payday from box office receipts. I really wish the newer TMNT films would do likewise.~MissSimonetta rated 6/10 on 3 August 2023"," Big fan: Pretty much everything I've wanted in a TMNT movie for decades, just a ton of fun in the theater. I'm as surprised as anybody that we have Seth Rogen to thank for this, but hey, whatever works. And there's plenty to be said about the art style borrowing from the Spiderverse movies, but it just fits. The Animation is vibrant, kinetic and absolutely lends itself to both the action and the humor. The whole movie looks like the margin drawings of a high schooler's notebook, that unrefined pencil and marker aesthetic.For me, the biggest present under this Christmas tree is the age-appropriate cast. Their chemistry is incredible and the turtles actually sound and feel like teenagers for once. As much as I gravitate towards Mikey in any given iteration, Donatello had all of the killer one-liners here; I loved Micah Abbey's performance.Maybe it's because of this Summer's frustrating movie season, but I left the theater with a real high after this. If the turtles needed a reboot, this was the way to go, and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Even that feels like an understatement ... I had a blast!~Mr-Fusion rated 8/10 on 15 August 2023"," ""Teenage Mutant Kung-Fu Turtles"": Yet another origin for these characters, one that is vastly different from ""classic"" Turtles.I wasn't expecting anything, and as a kid that grew up with the 1987's cartoon, it gave me nothing. Truthfully, it wasn't made to appeal to me (I'm not buying or playing with toys anymore).. but I still think most of these changes to be a downgrade affecting the general world-building, a few of the main characters (O'Neil, Baxter and Splinter), and even some minor villains' standing. But as a release made only to capitalize on merchandise for children, it doesn't have to be anything more than what it is. I can see kids having fun and coming out wanting to ""kick things"".As a film, it has awkward sound mixing and a soundtrack that assists with the griminess of the world. But it is visually quite interesting and the action is energetic, with a ""scribbles"" style that is very different! And while I appreciate the casting of actual teenagers, I'm not sure about the improvised-feeling dialogue. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable (your Adam Sandler-like crew that do their job and pad the IMDB with ""talent""). The writing is also terribly familiar, predictable and somewhat dull. It isn't particularly good, even if modern.I still don't like seth rogen putting his grease hands on as many properties as he is financially capable off, since he is clearly not a good writer, actor or franchise builder. But if it's good enough for kids.. then by all means, make more (which is certainly better than nothing at all).~daisukereds rated 5/10 on 12 August 2023"," An unexpected delight: Firstly, the animation for this film is exceptional. A truly unique depiction of New York. It's gritty, it's rugged but it also feel inviting. The scenic images and close up character shots feels like they have been ripped from the pages of a comic book.Whilst this may be an origin movie, the film is well paced and doesn't dwell on any one area for too long. After an introduction and 15 year time jump, we quickly get to understand the feelings and motivations of the characters which drive the plot in a natural manner.As a result the characters feel real which make for interesting on screen interactions. Splinter is an overly protective Father whilst the turtles are teenagers trying to grow out of their shells. Set in modern day New York, these Teenage Turtles are up to speed with pop culture which leads to funny one liners, easter eggs and mentions.The voice acting is great all round. Ice Cube is fantastic as Superfly, a street wise villain with a disdain for humans. At its heart, TMNT: Ninja Mayhem is a film about fitting it, growth and acceptance between amongst both humans and 'mutants'. This results in a perfect mix of a fun, comedy and a heartfelt story which can be enjoyed by everybody young and old.~ta-98251 rated 8/10 on 11 September 2023"," Oof: I had high expectations for this movie. And it turns out that what is missing is Laird/Eastman core violence that truly permeates the graphic novel. Failed in every feature film format but the t.v. Show was the closest to the spirit of the writing.Again, with the retread story of a rat who discovers baby turtles in some mutative ooze which causes them to speak. Splinterm the rat, has developed a phobia towards human beings. Having proven themselves to be cautious when it came to something different (by the way, this story takes place in New York where their garbage Mayor embraces criminality). Splinter does his best to hide his teens. But they dream of being...um...Ferris Bueller? Seriously.No. At the core is them wanting to be accepted into the human population. Story of conforming? Seriously. Though the Humans are horrible brutes, they eventually are saved by the mutants (big surprise) because that's what the script wants. Tag on some odd romance story of Master Splinter and a Cockroach mutant and...yep, here we are in Seth Rogen Land.This movie is anemic. The story is as basic as you can make it. Though I do like that the mutants share their distaste for humans, FlyGuy (played on point by Ice Cube) may have forgotten that his ""Dad"" was a human as well. The balance of humor to serious stakes fluctuates so much it's hard to keep up or care. It's your typical characters speaking over one another and you have to grab what joke you can. You don't know what era you're in since there are cell phones, social media but NYC looks like pre-Giuliani. A cesspool.I get why the critics fall over themselves for this tripe. April O'Neil in this case is a frumpy doughy Black teen. To the directors' credit, they never once mention that to be the case. Nor is she immune to the cruelty high school moments of bullydom. That's a welcome change. Though they desperately want you to believe her attraction through the eyes of sewer dwellers who've only seen human girls from afar. This new movement to like everything intersectional is why the press stumble on themselves to love it. Now did that sound complimentary to her?It's not a good movie. It's a series of ideas and jokes slapped together by a stoner's mind. They know where the laughs should land. And some of them do. When April's on-live t.v. Puke fest happens, I found myself laughing hard at how the public made memes of it. Maybe that wasn't the point.It's a really good message. But there is a better way to go towards this without having it seem so blase about the entire project. It wants to tackle something serious but also it's too silly to have the message hit.Anyway, seems like they have another one in the works, if you stick around for post credits.~statuskuo rated 4/10 on 5 August 2023"," Pretty Bad Movie: Rating: 5.0Overall, a miss in my eyes as the animation style does not make up for its poor execution and writing (with its corny use of modern references and poor plot construction making it too short to leave any profound effect), though children/fans of the TMNT franchise may like this movie more than me.Pretty Bad Direction (Moves the story in a pretty formulaic way (so decent); does a pretty good job in the action sequences as they are animated well; the interpersonal scenes feel more awkward as there is just a lot of empty space from it being corny and not relatable; the scenes where they try to drive messages and development forward are pretty shallow and not that meaningful; does not feel like he directed the voice actors well), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Decent from Jackie Chan (The main issue is I have heard Jackie Chan give better vocal performances than this and it just feels like he wasn't given that great of direction), Decent to Pretty Good from Ice Cube (The best vocal performance in the movie but feels like he was very limited given the direction and the movie being PG (he wanted to go off and be explicit and it shows)), Decent to Pretty Good from Ayo Edebiri (Does a good job in being the awkward side character and shows some depth and range), Decent from Giancarlo Esposito, Decent from Seth Rogen (Really is not given that much to work with but does a decent job), Decent from Paul Rudd (Does a decent job at being the comedic relief for the mutants), Decent from Maya Rudolph (Holds her own decently and does a good job at being a separate menacing antagonist), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Does not include the child voice actors; it just feels like there were so many unmemorable performances in the movie that it was hard to keep up with who was even each character and how relevant they were)), Pretty Bad Story (The story was pretty formulaic and too short overall; there was not any character development for the principal characters (which is a shame cause its supposed to be a pseudo-origin story); does a decent job at tying the story elements together throughout the movie (like referencing parts from the beginning to help drive the end)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty messy overall (I get the kids were doing improv, but I never wanna hear 'rizz' or 'ocky way' in a movie again (this movie will be cringey and dated in years to come); the attempts at humor missed the mark a lot of times as it came off more as corny than relatable for me; the symbolism was kinda shallow (but they did explain and tie things up well); foreshadowing was kinda decent (but a bit overt) as they used different elements from the beginning to tie things up in the climax), Decent Score/Pretty Good Soundtrack (though not very well used at times), Decent Sound, Pretty Good Visual Effects/Animation (The overall style had some charm to it being less polished and more choppy/comic-book based (which was a stylistic choice that I did enjoy, but there were many times where the dialogue scenes felt too cheap as the mouths of the characters did not match their words); the fight scenes were well animated; the cuts with real-world videos felt very tacky and cheap), Plot Structure was pretty formulaic and not that well set up as the movie was a bit too short (the rising action of them coming into their powers and rising as a fighting team was just a short montage (ruining their character development)); it would have been nice to have seen 15 minutes used to help give them more scenes where they learn to become better crime fighters, Pacing was fine (the issue is the plot was too short and could use a longer runtime), Climax was animated well (but felt a bit corny and predictable), Tone was pretty similar to other TMNT property (so a bit childish in its humor mixed with action fighting scenes)~cinemapersonified rated 5/10 on 4 August 2023"," I lost my Interest in the middle!: I was never really a fan of the comics, nor was I fond of the original animated show; if I'm being frank, it's the stylistic visuals in the trailer and the promos that grabbed my attention in the first place and lured me into watching this cinematic adaptation.So what do I think of it, as an impartial audience? As somebody who knows only the very basics about the source material? Well, it's strictly average.I will be honest with you all: I expected much better. The animations are vivid, and the score slaps hard, too, but the characters, as well as the writing, leave a lot to be desired! Despite having an eventful script, I hardly felt engaged with the happenings or was able to establish any personal connection. If truth be told, I lost interest in the middle, and by the end, I couldn't care less about anything or anyone.I wish my experience turned out differently.~SoumikBanerjee1996 rated 5/10 on 5 September 2023"," Rogen turns the turtles into Tik tok Gen mediocrity.: Yet another absolutely failed attempt at re-invigorating the TMNT film world. With every one of these newer entries comedy is forced to try to appeal to the times. This one is easily the most banal mostly thanks to the dryest of the dry ,Seth Rogen. I don't know how that guy ever even got his foot in the door to Hollywood because he is one of the most unfunny people around. The casting is also horrendously bad especially for the turtles themselves. Each one of the voice actors is not even close to the personality that should be brought to each of the individual turtles. The odd changes they made for certain characters and what they look like seem so desperately forced it's sickening. The only interesting factor of this film is the animation style which is just a rip off of the recemt also overrated spiderverse. At least some of it looks somewhat cool. Overall though this is what I thought it would be and it's pretty sad one of the Michael bay TMNT films are way more serviceable even when they're not even passable.~tresm87 rated 4/10 on 2 August 2023"," Enjoyable enough ride but falls short overall: Things I liked:I liked that they used actual teen actors for the turtles for the first time, and getting them to record at the same time created a natural, but at times chaotic and difficult to decipher, dialogue.Splinter's character was more fatherly and less focused on the strict sensei/teacher role.Superfly was a decent central villain with a bit of a backstory. He was kind of likeable to start with and turned quite dark and psychotic. Well acted by Ice Cube and gave the character some depth.The action set pieces were exciting and fast paced.The art style is different enough to make it visually interesting and the colours pop.A decent soundtrack of East coast hip-hop tunes.Things I didn't like:April is supposed to be a vulnerable teen who is a victim of bullying, but she came across a little annoying and arrogant, with an attitude, making it difficult to warm to her.Michelangelo wasn't ""Mikey"" enough, not the silly 'party dude'. Donatello didn't 'do machines' either, no gadgets or creations. There was a definite lack of distinction between the individual turtles personalities.Many of the villains felt under used and had little screen time. With dialogue often difficult to hear clearly due to background music or sounds. They also seemed very easily swayed over their allegiance.The origin story was changed and didn't make as much sense, but I guess it meant that they could drop Shredder and skim over it in 5 mins.Love it or hate it, the art style is different enough to appreciate, but I hated the use of real world footage at the movie and on YouTube. It snapped you out of the world they had created. At one point I thought the cinema had randomly started playing a different film.Some blatant product placement.Deliberate gender and race swapping, that felt forced to appease the Hollywood quotas, and often failed to hit the mark.Some poorly forced 'jokes' and cultural references that were often over pushed and quite literally 'milked'.~dalesimmance rated 6/10 on 6 August 2023"," The Turtles Movie I Didn't Know I Needed: Mutant Mayhem is the TMNT film that every iteration of these characters has been leading up to. Yes, the original film from the 90s will forever remain, but also forever be limited by the technology and technique of the times. The Michael Bay films...while ambitious and appropriate for the time, felt a bit silly in taking these characters so seriously.TMNT: Mutant Mayhem straddles the line between self-awareness and seriousness. This is a surprisingly sweet, heartfelt, and earnest film that carries some serious heart and, dare I say, humanity. It's a movie that explores something that other iterations have only briefly touched on: what it feels like to be a teenager, let alone one who has to be afraid of what the rest of the world thinks of you. It's nice to see a film that isn't cynical about humanity, and celebrates the best of us, whilst acknowledging our complexity. We need more of that.This is a movie that subverts our expectations and challenges our preconceived notions of what an ""action film"" should be. It's absolutely hilarious, with a snappy, quick witted, almost mumble core style that I immediately gravitated to. I was honestly shocked how well-written and funny this movie is. It has so many great lines and call backs (again, they overdo it a tad) that had me bellowing. It's also a movie that intelligently analyzes the Turtles mythos and makes the brilliant decision not to waste the characters. (You'll get what I mean when you see it).You can tell when actors are having a ton of fun with the material, and it just shone through in every frame of this movie.Speaking of which, the Turtles - Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) are absolutely perfect. For the first time, they feel like teenagers and exude a youthful energy that is really difficult to capture sometimes. They have excellent chemistry, even if I felt they sometimes blended together; we're used to the Turtles having extremely distinct personalities and it's not really the case here. I can see that bugging some people, but there's enough of these characters' historical tendencies here that it's obvious their distinct interpersonal dynamics will eventually be fleshed out in sequels. These are the Turtles at the youngest we've ever seen them, after all.I also have to shout out Ice Cube's Superfly. He's an awesome villain, with Mr. Cube shouldering a lot of the load in making him charismatic, funny, and threatening. Jackie Chan was a natural choice for Splinter and he's obviously fantastic; I'm genuinely surprised he hasn't played this role before. The rest of the mutant gang is great, if a bit under utilized; Seth Rogen's Bebop and John Cena's Rocksteady - characters we've all been dying to see - don't get as much screen time as I assumed they would, but it's fine.Ayo Edebiri's April O'Neil has (unsurprisingly) annoyed some, as she's, you know...a Gen Z person, but I thought Edebiri and the writers did a great job of modernizing the character and having her make sense with this new take.I didn't even mention the GORGEOUS animation, which feels a bit more evolutionary than revolutionary, but is all the same a welcome change. Remember the TMNT movie from 2007? The one with pixels and polygons? This film - in the vein of Spiderverse - eschews realism for a deliberately hand-drawn, cell-shaded look that harkens back to kids scribbling the Turtles in the their notebooks while bored in class. It's a brilliant decision and makes the film worth watching for the visuals alone. (I also like how steeped in the 80s aesthetic and weirdness this film is).One last thing...the music. My God. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross never miss, and the last thing I expected was for the music to be so amazing and memorable, but they did it again. With a killer 80s synth/sci-fi vibe, this movie's soundtrack is worth listening to by itself (I've been putting it on while working and it's perfect). A+ song choices as well.If I had any complaints, I do think the film takes a bit too long to get going, but once it does, it's paced extremely well. I felt the pop culture infused dialog (whilst realistic) did veer into product placement territory (and yes, there were some distracting product placements as well), which took me out of the film at times. I also felt the sound mixing was off in some scenes, which could've been my theatre, but there was a tinny sound, especially in the beginning. Oh, and there is an over reliance on overly expository dialog that I felt could've have been modified a little bit. The movie stops, multiple times, to deliver exposition in a way that I felt was a bit unnecessary.Overall though...this may be one of my favourite movies of the year. It's truly wonderful, sweet, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining and heartfelt. It was the Turtles movie I didn't know I needed, and now I can't wait for the sequel. And yes, there will (likely) be a sequel, and yes...HE will be in it. If you know, you know.~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 8/10 on 23 August 2023"
