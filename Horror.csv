Utterly fantastic!: GODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023) **** Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Sakura Ando, Yuki Yamada, Kuranosuke Sasake, Hidetaka Yaoshioka, Yuya Endo, Saki Nakatani. Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic). One of the year's best films.~george.schmidt rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"," The best movie I've seen in the theater this year: I would not call myself a huge Godzilla fan by any means and I mainly went to see this one at the urging of a friend. Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending.~MissSimonetta rated 9/10 on 3 December 2023"," Maybe the best Godzilla movie since the original: I'm a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great ""monster"" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)4) Shin Godzilla (2016)5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)~druss44121-1 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," OUTSTANDING: This is an exciting film. The pace, story, imagination, production are all done expertly. Dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles. I wish I could comment on writing but just be assured that despite my remedial Japanese (and a range of inconsequential translation departures the I detected), the cast's ability to convey agony, loss, hope, love, fear, and anger was appreciated, even with its 'just-right' dose of melodrama. Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity. It makes you fall in love with the characters.Then with perfect timing, reflects the singular and exquisite quality of the Japanese people; their acute sense of the cost of war and their abiding commitment to the future.Because of that, there is nothing in this film that I can criticize.~rhmacl rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," This is what a Godzilla is supposed to be: From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie. It kept everything that I loved about Godzilla, and was able to make an extremely interesting backstory with the human characters. There was a lot of things that was addressed in this movie that I had never seen before.there was so many things that people will pick apart, but that's upon reflection. I had no criticisms or a reason to dislike this movie the whole time I watched it. So, in that respect, I will give it a perfect score. And I don't go slinging those out just every review. As a Godzilla fan, this was perfection to me.~dormantgene rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," A Masterpiece Retelling of a Classic: Godzilla Minus One is an amazing spectacle on a retelling of a classic Kaiju movie from the prospective of a post-war Japanese veteran who leaves one horror for the next while making an arrangement of ""friends and family"" along the way. The story was so compelling that it didn't feel like two hours past and I was craving for more. The classic Godzilla sounds design, masterful cinematography, along with the original score from Akira Ifukube made this movie an absolute masterpiece on storytelling! The visuals of the Godzilla update made him more memorable and menacing for the citizens of a distraught Tokyo. Highly recommended!~Squirrel_the_Grip_1 rated 9/10 on 1 December 2023", One of the Best Godzilla movies in recent times: Godzilla Minus One is one of the best Godzilla films in recent time. It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.~tyzilla-02450 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023," This is one of the best iterations of Godzilla I have ever seen, and I have seen them all: I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.~sheridan-turner rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," Very good surprise: Finally a Godzilla movie with interesting and developed characters, for this point it's certainly the best of the franchise.(Spoiler part) I also thought the death of one particular character was really surprising... Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title ""Minus One"" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's ""Subarashiki nichiyobi"" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.~koroxx rated 9/10 on 3 November 2023"," Go See This Movie: After the brain cell killing abomination known as Godzilla vs. Kong, the monsterverse was ruined for me. I also found the movie Shin Godzilla to be kind of boring. I have yet to watch that movie and not fall asleep through it. So when I seen Godzilla Minus One, it blew me away. It is easily one of the best Godzilla movies out there. At least in the top 5. I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget. I am in no way interested in seeing Godzilla x Kong 2, but I would gladly see what Toho has in store for THEIR upcoming monster movie projects.~bak-67163 rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"
Dream Scenario (2023) - IMDb,7.1,Lily Bird|Nicolas Cage|Julianne Nicholson|Jessica Clement|Star Slade|David Klein|Kaleb Horn|Liz Adjei|Paula Boudreau|Marnie McPhail|Noah Lamanna|Tim Meadows|Dylan Baker|Maev Beaty|Marc Coppola|Krista Bridges|Conrad Coates|Marnie Brunton,Kristoffer Borgli,Kristoffer Borgli,"A hapless family man finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom."," Original, hilarious and even touching: Quick Review: My biggest pet peeve in films is dream sequences (I don't even love 'Inception' - don't hurt me). However the way they are done in 'Dream Scenario' was perfect. This film was a blast.Talk about getting everything out of a concept. The movie starts and you think, okay this is a lot of fun, but where are they going to go from here? Have no fear, they have plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the wild ride continues throughout.The film is hilarious. It contained some of the biggest theatre laughs I've heard in a long time. But it's more than that too. It actually gets quite touching and sad and has some real thought-provoking stuff going on. This was an excellent film. 8/10.~jtindahouse rated 8/10 on 1 October 2023"," Really good, up to the point where it isn't.: The first eighty percent of this film was excellent - it felt like the best Stephen King story that King didn't write. The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it.~Lomax343 rated 7/10 on 11 November 2023"," Great look at fame: Dream Scenario is a really funny look at unexpected fame and how it's impossible to control how others interpret it. A be careful what you wish for story that's a lot stronger when primarily focusing on how fame changes a person than when it delves into cancel culture.Uncomfortable with how his own image has been interpreted, Nicolas Cage is the ideal person for this. He plays the pitiful nature of Paul beautifully and brings none of the Cage rage he's synonymous with, in a nice change of pace. The film also feels aware of Cage's persona, understanding everything is funnier and weirder because it's Nic Cage specifically.Kristoffer Borgli's direction really nails the dream sequences in particular. They're very surreal (obviously), brief and when they start to turn into nightmares they really don't hold back on the violence. It also has the second most hilariously awkward sex scene of recent memory, with Beau Is Afraid being number one which is so fitting since Ari Aster is a producer on this.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 14 November 2023"," Bizarre Film: So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10.~vengeance20 rated 6/10 on 11 November 2023"," Leaves viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential: ""Dream Scenario"" falls short of expectations, failing to deliver the cathartic experience viewers seek. Despite an intriguing premise, the film's weak screenplay undermines its potential, leaving audiences frustrated. The lackluster narrative fails to engage, making the otherwise interesting plot lose its appeal. The film's inability to provide a satisfying resolution only exacerbates the viewer's dissatisfaction. With an unconvincing storyline, the movie struggles to maintain interest, leaving audiences questioning the overall creative direction. The weakness in character development further compounds the film's narrative shortcomings. ""Dream Scenario"" lacks the depth needed to connect emotionally with the audience, resulting in a missed opportunity for impactful storytelling. The film's failure to establish a cohesive and compelling storyline leaves viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential. In essence, the movie's disappointing screenplay overshadows any redeeming qualities it may have had, ultimately leaving audiences dissatisfied and questioning its overall merit.~cemozdogan rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Deeply Depressing Satire on Fame: Horror Comedy? Uhm, yeah, no. Sure, there's a handful of funny moments and some scary stuff but it's far from being a horror comedy. This is a very traditional ""Nicolas Cage"" drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there's a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage's performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It's definitely among the best films I've seen this year.~cgearheart rated 8/10 on 24 November 2023"," Nicholas Cage continues his rebirth: Dream Scenario. The increasingly brilliant Nicholas Cage continues his renaissance following his recent superb performances in Mandy, Pig and The unbearable weight of massive talent. Cage plays a run of the mill university professor who oozes normality. His students take no real notice of him. His former colleagues publish papers in top journals whilst he hasn't even started his book yet. But he's happy enough, if not fulfilled. Then, for no apparent reason, he starts appearing in people's dreams. Not just people who know or have met him. Anyone. And in the dreams they tend to be in difficult positions but he does absolutely nothing. He has no control over this. The first half of the film is hilarious - the whole cinema (the lovely Electric, Birmingham) we're in stitches as we see the dreams played out. And then the second half of the film takes a sinister turn, to reflect a changing nature of the dreams. And whilst the comedy ends at this point, the drama begins. Whilst the first half is the better half it would be wrong to say the second is disappointing. Cage is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. Long may it continue. 8 out of ten.~michael-kerrigan-526-124974 rated 8/10 on 15 November 2023"," Good idea, that isn't well explored: The story:University Teacher feels his life is passive.Starts showing up on people's dreams.People start giving him preferentiable treatment like he's a movie star.His introverted wife just wants him to appear on her dream in a sexy way, and doesn't like the spotlight.Ad agency wants to commercialize his image.He shoots down their ideas, he justs wants to write a book about ants.A girl from the ad agency tells him she has intense sexual dreams about him.He tries to have a fling with her, but gets so nervous he farts, and embarassed he leaves.He feels angry about a former colleague stealing his ideas.Starts showing up on people's dreams killing them.People start antagonizing him in the real world.He doesn't know how to react to that, and becomes combative, which worsens the situation.His wife distances from him due to shame.Some time passes.The teacher has stopped appearing in people's dream in America.Humanity develops the technology to make people enter other people's dreams.Vapid pretty teens are paid to make ads into people's dreams.The teacher eventualy learns to use the new technology and enter his wife's dream to appear in a sexy way. Happy ending.The analysys:The story is an allegory for fame. People who don't particularly want it, become viral, get used, don't know how to deal with the media, become adored and/or vilified, pay so much attention to the shiny new things that come into their life, that they lose sight of what they wanted the most. While other explore the new way to become viral for commercial purposes.The opinion: The movie has no opinion, doesn't try to teach you anything, doesn't take the concept into any interesting venue. And in the end, the moral is sort of ""all you need is love"", and ""cancel culture is bad"". Has anyone in the world not heard that boring idea a million times over at this point?Here are some interesting concepts they could've taken it: What made his powers start? What made his powers stop? What would happen if he tryed to feel other emotions before sleeping? What if he tryed lucid dreaming? What if he tryed to stop dreaming? What if he was smart enough as a college professor and avoided conflict and called the cops and sued people, instead of getting physical with them? Why only one girl had sex dreams with him?~o_oraculo rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Slow paced, distressing, and with no payoff: If you click on my profile, you will see that I rarely give low ratings to films, but this one checked all of my boxes, I guess.Have you had a tough last few years with covid and social isolation and politics?How about a movie that's both boring and depressing, with characters you don't like to root for?If a film can't be entertaining, it should at least be edifying, but ultimately Dream Scenario is just too weird to have anything to teach us.I guess it's sort of about cancel culture, but I can't think what it has to say about that. It's mostly about a sort of nobody guy whom you don't hate but has unlikable flaws and don't care what happens to him. And then horrible things happen to him, but not in a roller coaster like a horror movie but sort of a death march.~johnnymonsarrat rated 3/10 on 13 December 2023"," Borgli enters the big leagues with perhaps the most intriguing film of the year: I must say first that Dream Scenario is not at all what I expected it to be. After falling in love with writer/director Kristoffer Borgli's previous film Sick Of Myself, then exploring all of his recent short films on YouTube, I thought I had a grasp on what to expect from Dream Scenario, but I was off and that makes it a bit more challenging to form a solid opinion on. One thing is for certain though: regardless of how much you feel like you are enjoying the film as you are watching it, this is the kind of movie that will have you thinking and talking about it, trying to find all the analogies, for some time afterwards. Though my girlfriend left the theater a total of 4 times due to anxiety, she pulled even more apt metaphor out of it than I did when it was over - it gave us a lot to discuss, far more than the average movie.The overall tone was way different than I was expecting. The trailer had me thinking this would be a quirky adventure into dreams and personalities, but Dream Scenario is FAR more horror-leaning than I'd imagined. Having seen Borgli's previous work in combination with the choice to have Nicolas Cage as the lead, this really threw me off. Once you get into it, it often feels like the work of Ari Aster, which made a lot more sense to me when the ending credits hit and I saw that Ari Aster had produced it. Apparently Aster was originally set to direct this film with Adam Sandler as the lead, but after Sick Of Myself did well, Aster pushed to get Borgli in the director's chair for A24. Overall, the movie has its signature Borgli moments but it definitely feels like a combination of Borgli, Aster, and A24 vibes rather than simply a Borgli piece.There is not nearly as much comedy as I thought there would be, and most of it is very subdued. I felt like I was laughing more than anyone else in the theater, and it was not much, to be honest. Laughs are simply not one of the primary focuses of the film, in my opinion. And on the subject of atypical focuses, there are hardly fleshed-out characters in this movie at all - they are more like archetypes or vessels that allow the themes to be explored. The way Cage's character works is that he is an effective ""every man"" in the sense that he's not really likable, but also not especially unlikable - he could be just about any average person, and that's the point. The real ""main character"" is society and their response to what's happening in a collective manner.While it's not the most riveting or throughly enjoyable film, it is incredibly original and does seem to have a lot to say underneath it's surface of ""simplicity"". I was expecting something in the realm of Charlie Kaufman, but what I got was perhaps something I can't compare to almost anything else. At one point in the film, there is a book that is released, and when it does the character who wrote it exclaims ""It was supposed to be called Dream Scenario"", then the publisher responds, ""Is there something wrong with the new title, I Am Your Nightmare?"". I feel like this is a fitting summary of my entire experience with this film. I'm not sure if that was all set up on purpose, as a ""haha"" at the viewer's expense, but knowing Borgli and his specific style of genius-level trolling, I'd say he knew exactly what he was doing.~Stay_away_from_the_Metropol rated 7/10 on 23 November 2023"

The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Not sure what people are watching: I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad. I'll start with the few positives. It's mostly well-made from a technical perspective. I loved the scenes of carnage and chaos. And all of the kills made my jaw drop. It doesn't hold back.Everything outside of the kill scenes is bad. I wish they leaned more into the dark fun slasher vibes. Instead they try to be serious, which magnifies how bad, bland and dumb the rest of the movie is. And while the mystery is intriguing and unpredictable, the reveal isn't even a tiny bit satisfying.This will probably be more enjoyable if you haven't seen many movies. (1 viewing, 12/19/2023)~FeastMode rated 3/10 on 20 December 2023"," I never envisioned this film being so good: We actually got it. It took a long time but we finally got a 'Thanksgiving' movie based on the infamous 'Grindhouse' trailer from 2007. I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Bad: At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good. There is a solid horror movie in there somewhere but that movie is not written, directed and produced by Eli Roth.~Smarmelade rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Super Fun: There were so many opportunities for this movie to go wrong. There is nothing better than a painfully stupid concept well executed to the point that it is actually good. Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it.~tkdlifemagazine rated 7/10 on 19 November 2023"," The Year's Biggest Turkey: Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting. It isn't.I suppose I've only myself to blame for watching it. Clearly, I should've remembered Bob Newhart's words: ""See, Walt, that's an *American* holiday.""Thanks to a membership card, I saw this for free - and I still feel ripped off.~Lomax343 rated 2/10 on 18 November 2023"," I'm at a loss: I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes. I love cheesy horror movies, but this doesn't even count as one. I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.~Gith13 rated 2/10 on 2 December 2023"," There's something wrong about this one: Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.~kuner-59029 rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023", It's like Halloween is still going on.: Eli Roth is a genius! This is some of Roth's best work. The social commentary on Black Friday was well played and Thanksgiving has some of the best gory kills I ever seen. I was bursting out of my seat watching some people get killed and other deaths I felt bad for even though they were not great people. It's just that no one deserved to die the way Roth had some of these folks taken out.Plus it was witty. Thanksgiving took some stabs (pun intended) at itself and it was funny.Defiantly a worth wild horror flick. Felt like I been waiting 16 years for it sense that trailer in Grindhouse and it did not disappoint.~subxerogravity rated 8/10 on 19 November 2023," Mind numbingly STUPID: Look, I love slashers. Despite their low numbers they are my favorite subgenre of horror. I don't ask for much, a coherent story and a surprising villain. However - I draw the line at being insulted. I don't even know how this film got the funding - it is just an insult to audiences. The gore, great, and sure there are some laughs. However the story is beyond stupid, and fine I could forget that if the film was fun like ""Freaky"". However, the cast are awful, 30 year olds mascarading as high schoolers? Ok, I'll get over it. A killer who simply can't be the killer cause you just showed them in TWO places at once? I draw the line. It's insulting, and it made me so mad. All it took was a small rewrite to make something timeless. Instead an absolutely horrible film. So disappointing. More disappointing is people with no brain cells giving it 8 and 9 out of 10.~natashafitzsimons rated 2/10 on 28 November 2023"
A Haunting in Venice (2023) - IMDb,6.5,Kenneth Branagh|Michelle Yeoh|Jamie Dornan|Tina Fey|Dylan Corbett-Bader|Amir El-Masry|Riccardo Scamarcio|Fernando Piloni|Lorenzo Acquaviva|David Menkin|Camille Cottin|Kelly Reilly|Jude Hill|Yaw Nimako-Asamoah|Clara Duczmal|Rowan Robinson|Emma Laird|Stella Harris,Kenneth Branagh,Michael Green|Agatha Christie,"In post-World War II Venice, Poirot, now retired and living in his own exile, reluctantly attends a seance. But when one of the guests is murdered, it is up to the former detective to once again uncover the killer."," A good adaptation of a tricky book.: Poirot, now retired, and living in exile, is convinced by his friend Ariadne Oliver, to look into the honesty and integrity of a medium, who's set to visit bereaved mother Rowena Drake.If you're going into this one hoping for authenticity, you may be a little disappointed, I recently read the book, and aside from a few names and events, it is only very loosely based on the book.Authenticity to one side, I really did enjoy this movie, talk about an interesting choice, you can understand why Death on The Nile and Orient Express were chosen, but Halloween Party doesn't exactly lend itself well to an adaptation, but overall it works very well, plenty of plus points.The main winner, the visuals, with Venice they were never going to fail I guess, it looks sensational, but the camera angles and focuses are really nice, very atmospheric and suitably sinister, a shame a few scenes couldn't have been just a tad brighter. The masks, robes and costumes looked so good, they really did give it a Halloween vibe.I'd say this is Brannagh's most accomplished turn as Poirot so far, the toned down moustache has definitely made a difference, he feels more like Poirot.Well acted all round, Kelly Reilly is no stranger to Agatha Christie, she's excellent as Rowena, and as for the young man that played Leopold, he was great.My one gripe, Ariadne, I'm not knocking Tina Fey, she did a good job, but when you read the books, I just don't see her as an American glamour puss, I wonder if we'll see her again.I'm awarding an extra point for the fact that Branagh chose Halloween Party, and didn't opt for Evil under The Sun or Appointment with Death, but I wouldn't be surprised if one of those was number four.It worked well, 8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 15 September 2023"," A Haunting In Venice: Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has retired and is living in Venice where he is visited by his old friend Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey) who asks him to come to a seance held in a palatial Venetian house by top medium played by Michelle Yeoh who is seeking to speak with the spirit of a girl who apparently killed herself jumping from the building. Oliver wants Poirot to expose Yeoh as a fraud or start believing in the afterlife. He attends and there is a murder.Branagh's third go at a Poirot story and depending on your fondness for these things, potentially the best. It is very different from the previous 2 mysteries in that whilst the usual interviews and ripping up of alibis takes place, there is a very distinct supernatural element here, which may or may not be real. What Branagh does though is use this to create a much darker and decidedly well crafted spooky story (he should definitely make a straight ghost story) which is looking both for a murderer and proof that the ghostly bit is true or false. So whilst the gloss and usual extravagant beautifully dressed characters might be missing there is still a great mystery to enjoy. I hope he does another one.~henry8-3 rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Best of the three: A Haunting in Venice is the best of Kenneth Branagh's trilogy of Poirot adventures. This one being a smaller scale whodunit with a supernatural edge fixes any remaining issues whilst still being an engaging mystery with a satisfying answer to whodunit.Kenneth Branagh is still endlessly entertaining as Hercule Poirot, the humour is toned down here due to the darker story and yet again he's grown as a character by the end. Each one has tested something different, first it was his morality then his humanity and here it's his sanity that is pushed to breaking point.The cast is still undeniably star studded but still smaller than the predecessor which means no one goes unnoticed. Highlights include Tina Fey who makes for a great double act with Branagh's Poirot and Michelle Yeoh, given her best role in a Western film in ages (excluding EEAAO of course).Mostly being confined to one smaller, interior heavy location, Branagh's direction is even better that what's come before. His trademark canted angles have never been more at home and even though the film isn't massively scary, Branagh is still able to craft some effectively uncomfortable moments.Thanks to the location this franchise is finally free of the distracting CG that's been its biggest flaw. Being majority practical just makes the whole thing infinitely more immersive and means the stylish visual composition on display isn't having to make up for shoddy effects.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," SUPER FUN!: Started with some beautiful shots of Venice and instantly I was captured by how beautifully shot this film is. This was a really good Poirot. It's appropriate for the Halloween season and it achieves that without silliness or gore.Synopsis:""A Haunting in Venice"" is set in eerie, post-World War II Venice on All Hallows' Eve and is a terrifying mystery featuring the return of the celebrated sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Now retired and living in self-imposed exile in the world's most glamorous city, Poirot reluctantly attends a séance at a decaying, haunted palazzo. When one of the guests is murdered, the detective is thrust into a sinister world of shadows and secrets.~andrewchristianjr rated 8/10 on 14 September 2023"," Ken really does love his Dutch angles: Whereas the last two Branagh Agatha Christie adaptations were movies I sort of liked at first and started to realise were ""meh"" over time, this latest entry is one that I recognised as mediocre upon first viewing.Granted, it was really refreshing to see that this time, the filmmakers clearly put effort into the locations and production design. The film looks authentic and gorgeous, as opposed to its predecessors that were over reliant on unnecessary CGI backgrounds.The story does have some interesting ideas and compelling character interactions, but they unfortunately take a back seat half the time. For the other half, we get a lot of weak attempts at horror and red herring plot points that really do amount to nothing.I don't know what happened with the performances, but half of them are pretty great and the others are...well, awful. The actors clearly didn't agree on what kind of movie they were in, with some thinking it ought to be straight drama and others thinking they should play it corny.Like the previous films, this is a middling whodunnit, with all the rote machinations you expect from the genre, nothing shocking, nothing gripping, but nothing so bad as to tank the experience.It's the definition of mediocre.~benjaminskylerhill rated 5/10 on 15 September 2023"," If You Liked Orient Express and Death on the Nile this won't disappoint: A Haunting in Venice is the third film in the now Poirot trilogy directed and starring Kenneth Branagh. I'm a very casual Poirot viewer. My only exposure to the character is through these films and the British tv series, which I watched long ago and barely remember. As someone who has never read a Poirot novel, I personally liked the previous two films by Branagh, Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. I know many Agatha Christie fans do not, and I can understand why given that these films are not extremely loyal to the source material from what I'm told, especially this film.I haven't read the novel, A Halloween Party, but I'm told the only thing this film has in common with it is that it takes place on Halloween, and that there is a Halloween party in it. The culprit is the same in both, but the motivation and victims are entirely different. I'm guessing Branagh went with a far more obscure Poirot story this time, banking on the fact that not many have read and so they won't notice the many alterations made to it.However, as someone who is only a casual fan, just like with the last two films, I'll be judging this solely as a standalone piece and not an adaptation. From that viewpoint, I think the movie is good. Like with the last two movies, the film looks great, is wonderfully shot. This one evokes a strong haunting, Halloween atmosphere. The acting is good by everyone involved, even the child actors.The film is also significantly shorter than the previous two, though in some ways to the film's detriment. I felt Poirot solved the mystery a bit too quickly. The pacing is a bit rushed at the end, and I'm not entirely convinced of how Poirot comes to the conclusions he does.Despite that, the film is a fun mystery/haunting story. A fun movie to watch, especially around Halloween. I would still say I still like Murder on the Orient Express the most. But I would put this film slightly above Death on the Nile. If you're someone who likes the previous to films in this series, there's no reason not to check this out.~mitchell5954 rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," Dark and brooding ho hum plot: My Review- A Haunting in VeniceMy Rating 6/10I was underwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh's latest interpretation of an Agatha Christie novel this one is based on her 1969 novel Halloween Party .It was written late in the authors life to luke warm reviews one critic Robert Weaver wrote - Halloween Party is a disappointment,but with all her accomplishments is Christie can be forgiven some disappointments Poirot seems weary and so does the book.It was filmed previously in 2010 for television starring my favourite Hercule Poirot David Suchet which I watched only after seeing A Haunting in Venice.I must admit Kenneth Branagh who I like in some roles and not others is my least favourite characterisation of Hercule Poirot.His first effort in 2017 Murder on the Orient Express also underwhelmed me but did exceedingly well at the box office however his last effort in 2022 Death on the Nile flopped and for me also had nothing of the grandeur or appeal of the original film adaptations.All that needs to said about the plot line in this whodunnit is that Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot investigates a murder while attending a Halloween seance at a haunted palazzo in Venice, Italy.I was expecting more from this new original adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Halloween Party that's set in the mysterious and spectacular city of Venice because it's a story I didn't know and I had no preconceived expectations.Spectacular Venice is featured in the start and conclusion of this film but it's mostly set indoors in a gloomy gothic villa that could have been built on any movie set.A Haunting in Venice for me fails in a few aspects primarily because of its dark gothic reworking from Kenneth Branagh. It's probably his best Hercule Poirot performance but for me his interpretation of the novel lacks The Agatha Christie touch of humour, eccentric characters and is trying to be something it's not a gothic horror movie it's not really scary at all just dark and brooding.After I saw this movie I watched the 2010 television movie Hallowe'en Party starring David Suchet my favourite Hercule Poirot that bares no resemblance to A Haunting in Venice . It's not her greatest story but the television version has humour and lightness as well as suspense and the performances are much more impressive in my opinion.There are some interesting actors in the cast of A Haunting in Venice including Michelle Yeoh who dropped out of The action adventure 2024 film The Electric State to star in this movie. Why she chose to do this I'm not sure because her role as the clairvoyant Mrs Reynolds is more a short cameo role as is Jamie Dornan's who plays Dr Ferrier .The main supporting role is Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver a crime writer but she didn't shine for me either. Tina Fey plays a similar role in Only Murders in the Building as Cinda Canning but that role is edgy and funny which she does best .With a much more modest production budget of $60 million than his last Agatha Christie move Death in Venice Kenneth Branagh who also directs this movie in my view features himself as Poirot more at the expense of the ensemble characters which is a mistake in an Agatha Christie movie.~tm-sheehan rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Branagh's best Poirot film yet: I have loved everything about Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot series so far. So to see that his next adaption was going to be a fresh one and be more along the lines of horror - sign me up immediately. And the film lived up to the anticipation. If you don't get goosebumps when Poirot says, ""Tell the police not to worry, Hercule Poirot is on the case"" then you need to check your pulse. What an incredible character.Venice is such a terrific setting for a film. I've loved it (and been haunted by it) ever since seeing 1973's 'Don't Look Now'. The final scene in that movie will haunt me until the day I die. Even though 'A Haunting in Venice' is mostly set inside a closed building, Branagh continues to find ways to remind you just how great this setting is throughout the film.The mystery itself is really well done. I wasn't familiar with the story at all and it certainly stumped me and had me impressed once everything was revealed. The cast, while perhaps not quite as star-packed as the previous two installments, all still do an excellent job and play their roles well.I really enjoyed this film. I have no idea whether Branagh plans to stop at three or keep going, but I promise I will continue to watch them as long as he's involved. He has proven he very much knows what he's doing. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 14 September 2023"," bizarre camerawork: The film is a nonstop parade of extremely wide angle shots done from extremely high or extremely low positions. That and tons of dutch angles. If you get motion sick, avoid this!Usually those kinda camera tricks are used sparingly for a very specific effect. When used constantly, they lose impact and begin to confuse the audience (and make them nauseous!).Then, the script. It's silly and thin. The acting is all around just fine. But the lines and situations are dumb. Branagh can act, but his impression of a Belgian man is... uh... embarrassing.Finally, who is loving this stuff? It deviates incredibly far from Christie's stories, that I can't imagine too many hardcore fans liking this. Plus, when you have a rich history of David Suchet and Joan Hickson turning in fantastic performances as Christie's beloved characters; this one just feels wayyyy off center. No fun.~GSK23 rated 1/10 on 9 November 2023"," Tormenting in Venice...: If you're looking for a film that's clearly frightening, who's lid is very loose and needs some tightening, where the characters are dull, and the glass is less than full, join Poirot, in this grand faux, that's not enlivening. Although if Kenneth and his acting troupe engaged, gave the impression they weren't in it for the wage, I'd like to think it wouldn't stink, that my eyelids would not sink, into a stupor more akin to older age. Poor old Agatha must be spinning in her grave, it's not just the film that needs a little save, but I guess if you're a fan, can endure what others pan, you'll enjoy performances - that disengage.~Xstal rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"
Gremlins (1984) - IMDb,7.3,Zach Galligan|Phoebe Cates|Hoyt Axton|John Louie|Keye Luke|Don Steele|Susan Burgess|Scott Brady|Arnie Moore|Corey Feldman|Harry Carey Jr.|Dick Miller|Polly Holliday|Donald Elson|Belinda Balaski|Danny Llewelyn|Edward Andrews|Judge Reinhold,Joe Dante,Chris Columbus,A young man inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet and unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town.," Nobody's got a story like this one. Nobody!: A dark, crazy, twisted, inventive, and violent Christmas classic. There's really no way to classify or categorize Gremlins. It's too mean-spirited to be a kid's film, but not quite intense enough to justify a higher rating (though the 15-rated UK version makes a mockery of the BBFC guidelines). That grown-up 15 logo on the old VHS and the classic John Alvin poster artwork was enough to intrigue me as a kid and I've been hooked ever since.Gremlins has long been an annual tradition for movie fans. The cozy, snowy atmosphere of Kingston Falls (which appears to be in upstate New York somewhere but is, in actual fact, Hill Valley at Universal studios) is the perfect small town that we all wish we came from. Even when the Gremlins invade it's a homely place to be envious of.I was frightened of the Gremlins when I was a kid, but they're really nothing more than gigantic smiles with arms and legs. They exist only to have fun at the expense of human life and private property. I suppose they could be a metaphor for hedonism or apathy. Originally a much more evil script (intended to be an anti-Wonderful Life), Chris Columbus was inspired to write Gremlins as he listened to the rats in his apartment scurry about in the dark during the night. He lightened the material somewhat before filming began, but Joe Dante's wild vision makes it a twisted, festive reality.Special mention must be made of Jerry Goldsmith's outrageous score and that famous theme tune 'The Gremlin Rag', a demented circus fanfare of anarchy and mayhem. It's crazy to think that we had to wait 27 years to get released on CD. It's one of the first movie themes I even began humming as a young child, and I still do to this day.Gremlins sparked the rise of Chris Columbus as a creative force in Hollywood. Only 25 at the time of filming his career has been made up of classics, and Christmas classics, such as The Goonies, Young Sherlock Holmes, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Harry Potter, and Bicentennial Man. Joe Dante never scored a bigger hit, but his subsequent career significantly defined 80s and 90s cinema with movies such as Innerspace, The 'burbs, Gremlins 2, and Small Soldiers. Goldsmith scoring every one of them until his death in 2004 (and movie scoring has simply never recovered from this loss).Neither of them knew the massive franchise and fan-following which Gremlins would provoke, but it certainly deserves it's place in pop culture history.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 9/10 on 4 August 2000"," Come on, we're talking cable: Randall Peltzer (the late Hoyt Axton), while going all around town trying to sell his faulty wacky inventions, accidentally stumbles on a cute little Mogwai at an antique china store. The owner refuse to sell it, but the kid sees dollar signs and sells it to Mr. Peltzer, telling him three things never to do to the creature. So back in Kingston Falls, the misguided inventor presents it to his son, Billy (Zach Galligan) telling him the warning that the Chinese boy imparted to him. Needless to say, Billy ignores all three rules and soon evil little Gremlins are all over town causing rampant destruction.This movie is greatness in every single way. With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from the glorious '80's (Man that decade was GREAT to be a kid or teenager in).Never overtly slapstick comical, this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less and seeing the amazingly great Dick Miller is ALWAYS a treat. By the by, call me dense but I never realized that Howie Mandell did the voice for Gizmo. That's kinda neat.

Take ""Gremlins"" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see ""Critters""), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future,"" only not quite as eccentric. ""Back to the Future"" came out a year after ""Gremlins,"" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before ""Back to the Future,"" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)""Gremlins"" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like ""Back to the Future,"" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won't kid you -- it's not as complex as ""Future"" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.""Don't ever get them wet,"" Billy is more or less told by his father. ""And don't feed them after midnight."" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film ""Toy Soldiers"" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of ""Gremlins,"" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.)As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.I wouldn't expect many people to love ""Gremlins"" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.5/5 stars.John Ulmer~MovieAddict2016 rated 9/10 on 21 December 2003"," Ugly Bunch Of Creatures Causing Chaos: Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.Basically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn't have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.The film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can't be easy. Most comedy horror films are a joke (such as some of the Ghoulies films which emulated the Gremlins series) but Gremlins is both funny and scary. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well.Gremlins deserves a look from anyone interested in seeing a good comedy horror movie.~Big Movie Fan rated NA on 5 January 2003"," Best of the small creature attack movies.: After this movie there were several other movies that tried to capitalize on the success of this movie. For the most part though they failed to live up to the energy and fun of this movie. Heck, not even the sequel of this one had the energy of this movie. Here we have a guy getting a pet as an early xmas gift, a cute creature called a Mogway. It however, does have a few problems, as it needs special care. One thing you can't do to it is get it wet. Well Billy does (that is the guy who got it). This breeds more of the little critters, and they are harmless enough at first as well. Then they are fed after midnight and this turns them into Gremlins. This new form is a beer drinking, candy eating, mischief machine that isn't above killing. Most of the original batch is killed off in a gruesome kitchen scene, but the leader, Stripe, gets away and dives into a ycma swimming pool, so the whole town gets overrun by the little monsters. This movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Even though the Gremlins do kill, this movie never gets as dark as some of the copycats, or too goofy like some of them do. It ends up being a well-made movie that is fun to watch.~Aaron1375 rated 8/10 on 7 April 2003"," Perennial favourite: A perennial Christmas favourite, Joe Dante's monster movie is a kid's film for grown ups, made when children's cinema still had real bite. Watched today, twenty-six years after it was first released, it still holds a great deal of charm for the adult viewer who grew up in the '80s. As with most of Dante's movie, a lot of the fun alone comes from the director's clear affection for the genre, watching for all the gags and references that are surely to come, such as the scene involving the classic Time Machine.As for the rest of the movie...the depiction of small town and family life is very well realised. There's a cosy feel to film's first half. Zach Galligan is a charming hero, and Phoebe Cates the fitting object of his affection. Dick Miller, a genre standby since the '50s, has a nice role to sink his teeth into, and it's also great to see Keye Luke in a pivotal role. The supporting characters, particularly Hoyt Axton as the inventor-father, are well drawn. When the gremlins and their brand of anarchy take over, I was less impressed. The film descends into silliness I could have done without, but then picks up for a climax in which Gizmo shows his true colours, so it's not all bad. I found the sequel, GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH, to be equally fun.~Leofwine_draca rated 7/10 on 27 February 2011"," Large numbers of confused parents!!!: When this movie first came out, a lot of parents made the fatal mistake of thinking it was a cute, children's movie. In fact, it was this movie and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" that prompted the film industry to create the PG-13 rating. This one only got a PG.My mother was one of the parents who confused the movie as one suitable for children.Needless to say I was horrified by this movie as I was only 4 years old. This movie caused me to be severely afraid of the dark for many years. Yet, strangely enough, I wanted to watch it every year at my grandmother's house at Christmas time. It was tradition.I think that if parents knew what they were getting into, this wouldn't have been as big a movie as it was, and would probably have been lost among rummage sales, and good will donations as a movie nobody wanted.I love this movie, and it takes me back to when I was a frightened little boy, who was too scared to check under the bed when he heard those strange noises in the middle of the night. Almost 20 years later, those old scars still haven't healed completely, and sometimes just seeing ""Stripe"" on the cover will send chills down my spine and prompt me to move to a room with better lighting.That's damn good film-making. Freddy Krueger didn't even do that to me.I do get a kick out of the fact that every once in a while, the Disney channel will play this movie around the holidays.Hoyt Axton's monologue at the begining trys to bring us into the movie by being the ""story-teller"" but during the movie, we trick ourselves with ""it's only a movie."" Ending it with Axton's end monologue drags us back into the movie, leaving us with the though... ""There just might be a Gremlin in your house.""~nothingbeast rated NA on 26 April 2003"," Still a classic!: Made in a time when they had to make use of practical effects instead of CGI, 'Gremlins' still holds very well by today's standards. It's hard to believe this film was made almost four decades ago!The film is an interesting mix of comedy and horror. There are some really silly, illogical moments, but 'Gremlins' is not to be taken too seriously. You might sit shaking your head wondering why the creatures would do the silly things they do, but hey, it's all in the name of fun, right? Since these are also fictional creatures, who's to say what they are capable of and what their behavior should be?Towards the end all hell breaks loose, and some scenes are disgusting (in a comedy-horror good way), and it's wonderful! The film has a good, fairly suspenseful, action-packed final act.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 10 February 2020"," 20th Anniversary Review: Exactly 20 years ago today ""Gremlins"" opened in theaters across the U.S. It went on to be one of the biggest smash hits not only of the summer of 1984, but of the entire year. And in my opinion, it deserved to be a hit. I remember seeing this movie at a movie theater with some friends of mine right after it opened 20 years ago, and I said afterwards, ""this is going to be a huge hit"". And it was. ""Gremlins"" is a story that plays like a darker version of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."" Which is funny, because it was Spielberg himself who had the vision of ""Gremlins"" becoming a movie. Spielberg, along with his then collaborators Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy (the trio founded the production company Amblin Entertainment), served as executive producers of the film. Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies as well as the first two ""Home Alone"" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's ""Piranha"", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit ""Jaws"", and a segment of Spielberg's ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" a year earlier). What they created was a movie that was great fun from start to finish.  ""Gremlins"" is about a young man who receives a very unusual Christmas gift from his inventor father. He gets a little friendly creature called a Mogwai, which is as cute as a button. But there's a twist. There are three rules that must be followed in caring for the Mogwai: Rule #1 - Keep them away from light; Rule #2 - Don't get them wet; and Rule #3 - Don't feed them after midnight. When the rules get broken, all hell breaks loose as mean-spirited little monsters turn everything upside down. ""Gremlins"" then turns into a super-duper special effects picture, with the creatures created exceptionally by Chris Walas (Oscar winner for the makeup job on the 1986 remake of ""The Fly""). These monsters are scary to be sure, but also very funny with some of the antics they provide. Even though the special effect monsters steal the show, the acting by the human actors is very good too. Zach Galligan makes the most of his film debut as Billy Peltzer, the young hero who tries to stop the gremlins; Phoebe Cates is effective as his girlfriend; the late Hoyt Axton is a hoot as the inept inventor father (some of his crazy inventions are hilarious, especially when the inventions backfire into slapstick catastrophes); Frances Lee McCain is good as the mother and housewife (who has one big scene with the nasty critters); Polly Holliday is wickedly funny as Mrs. Deagle, the meanest woman in town; and Dante regular Dick Miller is a riot as Mr. Futterman, the nice man who's always complaining about hand-made products being made out of foreign parts. Judge Reinhold and Corey Feldman have small roles as Billy's bank co-worker and good friend, respectively, and look for a quick cameo by Spielberg himself. ""Gremlins"" was such a big hit in 1984 that it got re-released back in theaters the following year before it made its debut on video. The movie grossed over $153 million at the box office (combining the original 1984 release and the 1985 re-release). And it stands alone as a great creature feature. ""Gremlins"" was also imitated many times shortly afterwards. Following in its footsteps came 1985's ""Ghoulies"", and 1986's ""Troll"" and ""Critters"". All these movies spawned sequels of their own, and none of them came close to capturing the greatness of ""Gremlins"" (although the original ""Critters"" came the closest; it was the only movie out of that bunch that I mildly enjoyed). Six years later came the ""Gremlins"" sequel ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"". It wasn't as good as the original, but it's still a good movie sequel. I'll take ""Gremlins 2"" as well as the original ""Gremlins"" over ""Ghoulies"" or ""Troll"" anyday.***** (out of five)~ITTMovieFanatic rated 10/10 on 8 June 2004"," A wonderful nightmare fueled classic gem!: I got to see Gremlins in the theater today which was thrilling and very enjoyable especially since I've seen the film a few times.

Sijjin (2023) - IMDb,5.7,Ibrahim Risyad|Anggika Bolsterli|Messi Gusti|Delia Husein|Niken Anjani|Dewi Pakis|Oce Permatasari|Elly D. Luthan|Deni Saputra|M.N. Qomaruddin|Bismo Satrio,Hadrah Daeng Ratu,Lele Laila|Ersan Özer,A young woman who uses black magic to threaten her cousin's wife.," Nobody's got a story like this one. Nobody!: A dark, crazy, twisted, inventive, and violent Christmas classic. There's really no way to classify or categorize Gremlins. It's too mean-spirited to be a kid's film, but not quite intense enough to justify a higher rating (though the 15-rated UK version makes a mockery of the BBFC guidelines). That grown-up 15 logo on the old VHS and the classic John Alvin poster artwork was enough to intrigue me as a kid and I've been hooked ever since.Gremlins has long been an annual tradition for movie fans. The cozy, snowy atmosphere of Kingston Falls (which appears to be in upstate New York somewhere but is, in actual fact, Hill Valley at Universal studios) is the perfect small town that we all wish we came from. Even when the Gremlins invade it's a homely place to be envious of.I was frightened of the Gremlins when I was a kid, but they're really nothing more than gigantic smiles with arms and legs. They exist only to have fun at the expense of human life and private property. I suppose they could be a metaphor for hedonism or apathy. Originally a much more evil script (intended to be an anti-Wonderful Life), Chris Columbus was inspired to write Gremlins as he listened to the rats in his apartment scurry about in the dark during the night. He lightened the material somewhat before filming began, but Joe Dante's wild vision makes it a twisted, festive reality.Special mention must be made of Jerry Goldsmith's outrageous score and that famous theme tune 'The Gremlin Rag', a demented circus fanfare of anarchy and mayhem. It's crazy to think that we had to wait 27 years to get released on CD. It's one of the first movie themes I even began humming as a young child, and I still do to this day.Gremlins sparked the rise of Chris Columbus as a creative force in Hollywood. Only 25 at the time of filming his career has been made up of classics, and Christmas classics, such as The Goonies, Young Sherlock Holmes, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Harry Potter, and Bicentennial Man. Joe Dante never scored a bigger hit, but his subsequent career significantly defined 80s and 90s cinema with movies such as Innerspace, The 'burbs, Gremlins 2, and Small Soldiers. Goldsmith scoring every one of them until his death in 2004 (and movie scoring has simply never recovered from this loss).Neither of them knew the massive franchise and fan-following which Gremlins would provoke, but it certainly deserves it's place in pop culture history.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 9/10 on 4 August 2000"," Come on, we're talking cable: Randall Peltzer (the late Hoyt Axton), while going all around town trying to sell his faulty wacky inventions, accidentally stumbles on a cute little Mogwai at an antique china store. The owner refuse to sell it, but the kid sees dollar signs and sells it to Mr. Peltzer, telling him three things never to do to the creature. So back in Kingston Falls, the misguided inventor presents it to his son, Billy (Zach Galligan) telling him the warning that the Chinese boy imparted to him. Needless to say, Billy ignores all three rules and soon evil little Gremlins are all over town causing rampant destruction.This movie is greatness in every single way. With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from the glorious '80's (Man that decade was GREAT to be a kid or teenager in).Never overtly slapstick comical, this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less and seeing the amazingly great Dick Miller is ALWAYS a treat. By the by, call me dense but I never realized that Howie Mandell did the voice for Gizmo. That's kinda neat. This was followed by a sequel that's just about every bit as good as the original.My Grade: A Special Edition DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Joe Dante, Producer Mike Finnell and Gremlins Creator Chris Walas, Second Commentary by Dante and Actors Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller and Howie Mandel; Cast & Crews bios; 8 Additional Scenes (with Optional Commentary; Photo Gallery; short vintage featurette; Theatrical & Re-issue Trailer; and Trailer for ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch""~movieman_kev rated 10/10 on 15 October 2005"," One of my personal favorites...: Some films are not what they seem. Take ""Gremlins"" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see ""Critters""), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future,"" only not quite as eccentric. ""Back to the Future"" came out a year after ""Gremlins,"" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before ""Back to the Future,"" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)""Gremlins"" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like ""Back to the Future,"" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won't kid you -- it's not as complex as ""Future"" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.""Don't ever get them wet,"" Billy is more or less told by his father. ""And don't feed them after midnight."" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film ""Toy Soldiers"" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of ""Gremlins,"" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.)As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.I wouldn't expect many people to love ""Gremlins"" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.5/5 stars.John Ulmer~MovieAddict2016 rated 9/10 on 21 December 2003"," Ugly Bunch Of Creatures Causing Chaos: Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.Basically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn't have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.The film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can't be easy.

Saville|Bryony Skillington,Ti West,Ti West,"In 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives."," Ti West's exploitation mash-up: Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.~gortx rated NA on 31 March 2022"," Nice old-fashioned horror-flick with some hefty gore.: I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).~johannes2000-1 rated 8/10 on 16 March 2022"," What a great disappointment ...: My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !~tchitouniaram rated 3/10 on 16 April 2022"," X: 5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes.~JoBloTheMovieCritic rated 5/10 on 19 March 2022"," Strange, heartfelt, classic slasher: I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have.~miles670 rated 7/10 on 15 April 2022"," Nothing new here, but nothing bad either: An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.~aidanratesmovies rated 6/10 on 2 April 2022"," Overhyped. Doesn't live up to A24 other films.: While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.~Horror_Flick_Fanatic rated 5/10 on 20 March 2022"," Rubbish: Don't get the positive reviews, basic acting, boring plot and genuinely pointless, the story was just so dated and predictable.The killsOh go into this basementWhy can't we see the handOh a distractionThree random holes in a wallSo many stupid predictable lazy outcomes. It was just a tragic mess that was slow, dull and lazy.~chris_rowe-881-168820 rated 2/10 on 23 March 2022"," A Fun, Classically Styled Slasher: Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.~cadillac20 rated 8/10 on 18 March 2022"," Fails at every level: After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess.~HorrorEnjoyer rated 1/10 on 26 May 2022"

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's."," A Good Time!: Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't ""scared"" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering ""Can I take my kid to see this?"". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The ""twist"" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think ""Is this a horror film?"". It's not ""balls-to-the-wall"" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.~Liam3011 rated 7/10 on 25 October 2023"," Not as good as I'd hoped, but I still enjoyed it.: A security guard gets a job, and suddenly realises he's going to have an incredibly challenging and difficult night.I genuinely and desperately wanted to love this film, the trailers looked so cool, and despite not being a gamer, I knew of the game.Now, if I were judging this solely on the visuals, I'd be giving it a mammoth score, and healing praise onto it, it does look fantastic, and as for the 'locals,' they look so cool, the special effects are great, genuinely a smashing looking film, one that my fifteen year old self would have loved.Now, the important bit, the translation from game to film, I really wish I could say it worked brilliantly, I'm not sure, I think there's something missing, does the story work? Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 6/10 on 12 November 2023"," Fantastic Visuals, Wafer-Thin Story: So, I know it must be extremely difficult to take a simple gaming concept like Five Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline ""cheese"", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.~tankboy-46851 rated 6/10 on 27 October 2023"," 9/10 for looks - 3/10 for screenplay: If you loved the FNAF games, go see this, at the base level it's fun to see this stuff come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.~Chri-seened-it rated 5/10 on 27 October 2023", Had so much potential!: Five Night at Freddy's was a pretty big letdown. I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.~djrmc24 rated 4/10 on 30 October 2023," Nothing really special: I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole ""kidnapped little brother"" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.~AfricanBro rated 5/10 on 31 October 2023"," Solid fun time: People are overanalyzing this movie as though it's supposed to be a masterclass in acting and screenwriting. It's a ""horror"" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.~PrinceCharmingHere rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," It's for the fans, to have a good time: Listen, this is no cinematographic masterpiece, but it's a good whimsical even sometimes satirical camp movie. I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣~gurday rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," Massive script issues: Just saw Five Nights at Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.~katharine-nichols rated 5/10 on 31 October 2023"," Forgetting the most important thing: Jesus, anyone giving this a ten wants their head checked.Feels like a wasted opportunity to me, because visually speaking, it was a really strong flick. The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative.~rws_20 rated 3/10 on 30 October 2023"

It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.~ethanbresnett rated 8/10 on 25 July 2023"," The hand of pure evil.: A group of youngsters discover that by taking part in a small ritual involving an embalmed, ceramic hand, that they're able to contact spirits from the other side.One of the better horror films I've seen for some time, when I compare to the other horrors I've seen in 2023, this rates as the best so far.Talk to me has a degree of originality, it's loaded with jump scares, and has some genuinely memorable moments. The writing was rather good, everything pieced together nicely, including that pretty shocking opening sequence.Quite graphic at times, it wasn't afraid to show a bit of gore, eyeball, that's all I'm saying, I had to look away. I loved that deliciously dark closing scene, it was such a strong, cohesive end to the film, it really worked.There were a couple of clichés, and there were a couple of moments where you're left scratching your head, puzzling whether people would actually do the things that happened here, but those are minor faults, the only major gripe I had, was the rebirth of The Crazy Frog music (I thought our ears had been spared that years ago.)They trailered Cobweb and Nun 2, will either of them surpass this one? Will have to wait and see.A big thumbs up.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 3 August 2023"," I Feel Sick.: Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.~fletcherw928 rated 9/10 on 27 July 2023"," A mix of amazing and not so good: I watched Talk to Me early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. It's a movie I'd already planned on seeing, so I was happy with the choice while also having no idea what to expect. I came out of the movie very mixed.There are lots of positives, the biggest being some truly awesome horror moments. My jaw dropped multiple times at some of these brutal moments. And with an R-rating, it didn't have to hold back. I wish more movies had the courage to do this instead of opting for a milder PG-13 movie, pandering to the casuals and teens.The movie is mostly well-made. I love how loud the sound effects are. Sophie Wilde gives a great performance and Joe Bird has some amazing moments. It also uses the horror premise in a few unique ways, making it more like a game or a drug.Unfortunately not everything works. It doesn't seem like it knows where to go and doesn't come together all that well. A few of the scares involve grossing out the audience. I don't find gross to be scary. It's just nasty.But the worst thing, for me at least, is I was not nearly as engaged as I should have been during the climax. I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was sort of just... there.I heard someone call this the Smile of 2023, a surprise horror flick that comes out of nowhere and blows everyone away. I don't think it comes close to Smile, my favorite movie of last year.I can see some people loving this, but I can't personally recommend it.(1 viewing, Mystery Movie Monday 7/10/2023)~FeastMode rated 5/10 on 11 July 2023"," Great premise, subpar execution.: The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.~manuelasaez rated 5/10 on 13 September 2023"," Was rooting for the hand.: Well, I actually had high expectations for this. Read a lot of positive stuff, damn my English teacher. Anyway what we have here is a good idea, ruined by a bunch of characters I hated. A bunch of whiny, self centered teens, with smarts somewhere between a Mars bar and a US President. Mustn't forget some of the stoopidist suspension of logic flaws I've seen in a horror movie for some time. After the Police arrived, and left, the whole plot collapsed. For a horror movie to really work, it has to draw you in with realistic, everyday likelihoods. The cops would have shut the house down, taken all the phone footage and confiscated the hand. They did none of the above.. Now a hand that allows you to contact the dead I'm prepared to give a pass. A bunch of Aussies finest, walking away from a blood splattered crime scene without a hint of concern.. Well your taking the p**s aren't you mate! The Cinematography however was excellent. Kudos to them.~stebai66 rated 4/10 on 13 September 2023"," Talk to the Hand: Quite literally - and no pun intended of course. Also you have to suspend your disbelief ... like really really suspend it. If you'd ask any of the characters how ... well not intelligent they are, they would answer ... yes. Now if that sounds like it doesn't make sense ... it is because it doesn't make sense ... which I hope makes sense to say/write. It does to me of course.If you are able to handle those things that I would call flaws and not be annoyed by them ... well the movie is every bit as good as you may have heard it is. The horror is quite frightening - the story is tight and the ending ... well that has quite the impact to it. And even if you may see it coming ... it is so well shot and done, it won't matter.A24 knows their stuff and their movies are being hailed for the right reasons most of the time. They are also not easy movies to watch. Violence (peak) and horror of every kind ... you've been warned. Be different than the characters here and heed those warnings ... and act accordingly.~kosmasp rated 8/10 on 24 April 2023"," Does Not Talk to Me: I'll take any bet - any good old Alice Cooper show is still more horrifying as Talk to Me. The art of horror in this film boils down to a few pictures; the rest is just a generic mess with storytelling in slow mo (I was almost asleep until something happened, and I should have given in to the powers of Morpheus...). It's filled with characters that nobody but a select few will care about. On top, on the horror-o-meter, this rates very low. Maybe if you're still not in your teens, you'll get some goosebumps. Anyway, I really don't know why, even in an exciting genre like horror, where almost anything goes, I got the impression that everyone involved in making the movie (and other ""horror"" movies too) treated it like a chore. Verdict: boring, generic, heartless. On the pro side: production is solid.~Tweetienator rated 4/10 on 12 September 2023"," Didn't quite hit the mark: I've spoken in the past about being a big fan of Australian horror movies. Some of my all time favourites have come from this country. So it's a little disappointing that the last two Australian horror movies I've watched ('Run Rabbit Run' and 'Talk to Me') have been a bit of a let down. The latter was nowhere near as big of a let down as the former to be fair. There were parts of this film I liked, but overall it didn't quite hit the right spots.I'm finding possession films less and less scary with every year that goes by. I find that as soon as you see the ghosts/demons it's just too hard to believe (even though the make-up work in 'Talk to Me' was very well done). The only time it really works for me any more is in films like 'Paranormal Activity' where you rarely actually see anything. Seeing less will always be more in this circumstance.So I didn't find the film overly scary, and then all I really have to fall back on is the characters. Sadly we've reached a point where the only way to write realistic teenage characters any more is to make them extremely unpleasant. If they were all overly nice it wouldn't feel like they were properly written, yet if they are particularly unpleasant then it isn't much fun to watch them. It's a real predicament that the horror genre has and I don't know the way around it.I will say that the ghosts/demons were done in such a way that if that is the kind of thing that scares you I could see this movie being very effective and creepy. Otherwise though, you might be fresh out of luck with this one. 6/10.~jtindahouse rated 6/10 on 28 July 2023"," Doesn't feel very new: The whole cast is superb. Unfortunately, the plot isn't as great and it's not ''atmospheric'' enough to pretend to not care about a plot. As much as I wanted it not to be, it remained a cliché from beginning to end. Not a terrible one and it had some innovations here and there but if it weren't for the cast carrying out the scenes so well, it would have been yet another horror movie.Spoiler : To me the plot really took a cheaper path when the mother was introduced. This is nothing more than the usual ''evil spirit passing as a loved one to trick you into letting them in'' which is 90% of possession-themed movies and nothing new seemed to have been added here.The story also feels more rushed towards the end in that the directors are trying to simultaneously commit to multiple ideas that are not fully developed and nourished.5/10 made 6/10 for the spot on acting.~AndSoForth rated 6/10 on 24 July 2023"

Because this is such a primal story it could be the most powerful and disturbing film of the year. The characters speak in a kind of dead tone, usually on banal matters (like how waterproof a watch is). The music alternates eerie silences with harsh nerve-wracking strings and drums. Shots of surgery and blood churn the stomach. The widescreen settings have an amphitheatrical stretch. Alone among recent films, it sends you out in catharsis — ""calm of mind, all passion spent."" This film releases you, drained. A man's misdeed brings down a curse upon his entire house that only his own immense sacrifice can expiate. That's the Greek tragedy, beside which our mundane stories of simple guilt, rationalization, mercy, forgiveness, and even human justice — the business of cops and courts — dwindle into insignificance. This primitive drama involves a heart surgeon Steven Murphy and his ophthalmologist wife Anna. That is, the elemental force erupts in the seat of modern science, rationalism, humanity. The professional curers are profoundly afflicted. Their reason is helpless, irrelevant, once the old pagan gods have been stirred to ire. Dr Murphy was at least tipsy when his bungled surgery cost a man's life. Murphy has not openly accepted responsibility or expressed his guilt. But he did attend the man's funeral and stop drinking altogether. He also befriended the man's orphaned son Martin, whom he buys gifts and offers friendship as a sop to confronting his own guilt on any deeper level. Now Martin swells from orphaned son into preternatural agent of vengeance. For his father's death has proved a curse on his house too. He and his mother — in different ways — crave Dr Murphy to replace the dead man in their lives: ""My mom's attracted to you. She's got a great body."" This thuggish kid has an other-worldly understanding. He has become the seer, the oracle who alone fathoms the root cause of the Murphy curse and its resolution. If Murphy doesn't kill one of his children, his entire family will die. First they are paralyzed, deprived of appetite and will, then their eyes erupt in Oedipusian bleed, then they die. Of course these modern sophisticates deny this savage myth. Murphy in particular blames Martin for the curse he has only reported. Daughter Kim understands, because she wrote a paper on Iphygenia, Agamemnon's daughter whom he has to sacrifice to atone for having killed a sacred deer. Kim is attracted to Martin and offers herself to him. In him she senses a worldliness apart from the others. Having initially assumed kid brother Bob would go (""Can I have your MP3 when you die?) she then volunteers to be Dr Murphy's sacrifice. She knows the story.The Murphys' life is characterized by a kind of torpor. No-one has any zest for anything. The conversations are banal and wary. Dr Murphy and then Kim report her first period as if it were a head cold. All sense of the primeval has been lost. Anna feigns total anesthesia for her sex with her husband. His friend and anesthesiologist charges Anna a hand job for info. Facing the curse Steven tries coaxing, coercion, threats, even physical violence and the threat of murder, to shake the seer off his vision. Steven turns to a school counsellor for advice on which child to pick. Anna twigs to their predicament: ""Our children are dying, but yes. I can make you mashed potatoes."" She marshals the will to free Martin from her husband's futile abuse. Indeed both the doctor and the anesthesiologist each blame the other for failures in the operating room. This is the modern world with advanced science and culture but with stupefied emotions and a shallow sense of responsibility. Dr Murphy forbids smoking in the house, but his wife and daughter smoke outside. Martin accepts his recent addiction with the same resignation he seems to have accepted as his role of messenger from the gods, to bring Murphy to their harsh justice. This elemental tragedy is the prophet director's harsh judgment on a world that evades its guilt and responsibility by suspending all conscience, all sense of a higher purpose than the mundane and worldly. The modern news cycle allows no time for the eternal.~maurice_yacowar rated 10/10 on 8 November 2017"," Modern take on a Greek myth.: I went into watching this with no background and it is strange from the start, the stilted dialog and unusual responses characters often give. The title threw me until I read later that one version of the Greek myth requires the killing of a sacred deer to get the gods to help.I watched this until the end and was NOT satisfied with its conclusion. A teenager whose dad died on the operating table seems required to take revenge on the doctor's family and that means killing one of them, as they first become paralyzed then their eyes bleed. The only way this could have any reality in today's world is if the teenager has some sort of supernatural powers. And in fact there is a scene where the doctor's wife (Kidman) kisses the bloody feet of the tied-up teenager in their basement, presumably to suggest the biblical story of Jesus' feet being washed by a prostitute.So, while the movie is well-made in most respects, and the actors are good, I did NOT find this movie satisfying. Maybe if I were a fan of Greek mythology it would come across better. I found it very interesting, just not very good.On BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.~TxMike rated NA on 20 September 2020"," Diiiiiiiiistuuuuuurbbbbbiiiing: They have you terrified at what was going to come out of someones mouth in just about every scene.

Should have a warning, ""written by some one with psycological issues""~SeanDTheFilmMaker rated 8/10 on 16 October 2018"," Iphigenia in Aulis: What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen ""The Lobster"" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of ""The Lobster"" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation ""Iphigenia"" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is rather muddled.In the Greek myth, King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, at the behest of the goddess Artemis to allow him and his troops to proceed on the warpath to fight the Trojans. In some versions, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, hence the title of this movie. The reason I don't think the effects work as well here as they did in ""The Lobster"" is because whereas that movie took human shortcomings to absurd extremes, this one takes what was already by modern standards an absurd myth and attempts to make it modern and more ordinary. Gods are dead and replaced by doctors, and if there is a god, apparently, he's a pockmarked teenager seeking revenge for his dead father. I suppose a surgeon's wife role playing during sex as a patient under general anesthesia and a father recalling to his son the time he masturbated his father is more in line with some of the sexual perversity one finds in some Classical Greek literature, though. Yet, overall, it comes across as disjointed. If this were supposed to be a psychological thriller, it seems difficult to lure the spectator in without being able to identify with the characters--whereas this was unnecessary in the black comedy of ""The Lobster"" (and contradictory to the intent of the Greek movies). But, the stilted acting and illogical premise of the narrative works against identification. I don't think any amount of tense scoring and camera movement from distant perspectives can alleviate that--in a world where nothing is sacred.P.S. I still don't quite get the point of ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) as the film-within-the-film. Is it just because characters in both are prisoners of fate or something? I prefer the self-reflexivity of the director's prior ""Dogtooth"" (2009) and ""Alps"" (2011).~Cineanalyst rated 5/10 on 2 December 2018"," Misunderstood: This is definitely not one for everyone and that's okay, sure, but to assign it a 1-star or 2-star rating as some have done, is just ridiculous, especially when the disconnect certainly is on the side of the viewer. In fact, those who deemed the acting 'bad' (one reviewer notes: ""I thought the characters were robots"") missed the entire point of the film.While, admittedly, the acting from the girl who plays the daughter is flawed, both the acting from the rest of the cast and the way in which the story unfolds is purposefully meant to make you feel highly uncomfortable - and it succeeds.From the very first scene, to where your mind goes in regard to the sexual nature of the relationships, to the inappropriate or generally eyebrow-raising topics of discussion between some of the characters, this film is MEANT to BE ""creepy"" and to make the viewer FEEL odd, off - and even dirty.Much of the creepy-factor, if you will, comes PRECISELY FROM the amazing way in which most of these talented actors made these characters come across as disturbing, unappealing, ALMOST like most of us, ALMOST worth sympathizing with, but not quite. It would have lost much as a film of this nature had the acting been that of a normal or run-of-the-mill family). Again, EVERYTHING, from the topics of conversations, to their postures, to their almost detached delivery, was purposeful and meant to lend to the eeriness of the film and the discomfort of the viewer. THINK about it for a moment: have you ever watched Colin Farrell NOT deliver an enthusiastic, almost convivial performance? The departure from his easy affability in other roles, and almost apathetic delivery in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, was purposeful, and necessary to drive the uncomfortable narrative deep into the viewers minds. This is the very same reason (among many others) one particular character sings - eerily. The viewing experience had to be uncomfortable.While The Killing of a Sacred Deer may not go down as a family favorite or as one we watch over and over, it is definitely engrossing for its running time and more importantly, it isn't the thousands of other films on hundreds of streaming sites with nothing to say for itself. In short, for those who specifically look for and enjoy films which are not the standard fare, this one is a should-watch.7.6/8.~Her-Excellency rated 8/10 on 11 December 2021"," artistic endearvor: Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) have teen daughter Kim and young son Bob. He is befriended by Martin (Barry Keoghan) who is the son of his dead patient. Martin insinuates himself into Steven's family and Kim falls for him. Martin reveals his threatening predictions with a devastating solution.After his interesting weird The Lobster, Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos creates another oddity. His insistence on the mannered monotone dialogue delivery has a hypnotic effect that puts me to sleep. I had to rewind to get back into the flow. Keoghan's dead-eye serial killer performance is too obvious. I can't believe that Steven would bring him into his home. While I appreciate a lot of the outsider oddity flavor, I cannot take any reality from any of the characters or situation. The first thought I have as Steven is that the boy poisoned my family. At a certain point, these are no longer realistic people but rather artistic installations. There is some value in the artwork and I can imagine this story as a shocking psychological thriller in another person's hands.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 3 March 2018"," Weird, Intriguing but Absolutely Disappointing and Overrated: The renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is married with Dr. Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) with two children, the young teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and the boy Bob (Sunny Suljic) that are their pride and joy. He works with the anesthetist Matthew (Bill Camp) and recently he is dedicating attention to the teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan), whose father died in a surgery. Steven brings Martin to meet his family and the teenager invites him to have dinner at his home with his mother (Alicia Silverstone), who harasses Steven. He rejects and on the next day, Bob gets sick without walking. Steven and Anna bring Bob to the hospital and after a complete checkup, the doctors do not find any problem with the boy. Soon Martin meets Steven and tells that he killed his father; now he has to kill Anna or Kim or Bob; otherwise they will all get sick and die. Who is Martin?""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a weird, intriguing but absolutely disappointing and overrated film. The plot and the performances are cold, without heart, and has scenes absolutely unnecessary, like Anna masturbating Matthew in the car or the cameo of Alicia Silverstone. However, the screenplay holds the attention of the viewer that expects the clarification of the mystery. Unfortunatelly the conclusion is awful without any explanation for what is happening or who Martin is or has done. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available~claudio_carvalho rated 3/10 on 15 December 2017"," much more than a psychological thriller: Saying that the ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is just a great psychological thriller is at least undermining... This film is full of brilliant metaphors, but you have to know Greek mythology and history to understand some of them. When Agamemnonas wanted to go to Troy to fight with his ships, there was no wind and he could't get there. So he asked the Gods to throw some strong winds, but the Gods replied that he had to sacrifice something in order to get the winds he desired, so they told him he had to kill his daughter. Agamemnonas thought about it and he decided to kill his daughter, but when he was just about to kill her, the gods transformed her into a deer, so he killed a sacred deer.That's where the title of the movie comes from and you can easily guess the reason..So this film is about choices, sacrifices and revenge.But revenge from the Gods. When Martin can bring sickness and death to Steven's whole family, in fact martin is in the place of a God from Greek mythology. And his duty is to bring the justice and punish those who overestimated their powers and tried to play gods( Steven went to do a surgery drunk)In addition to that, this great film of lanthimos, gives a harsh critic to the modern way of living in the western societies. Alienation, fake goals, fake relations and money that that bring comfort but not happiness.In conclusion it's a great film that gives you much homework to think about when you get home after you watched it and surely much more than just a great psychological thriller that many people believe it to be..~methodman-70252 rated 8/10 on 4 November 2017"," V for Vendetta...: What would you do, if a young man came to you, presented you with options after all you'd put him through, where the choices were insane, but you had to take the blame, a vendetta must be settled, and there's no way to eschew.An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, the justice of the vengeful although I'm not sure it would soothe, but the killing sprees continue in 50 countries and some more, the barbarity of revenge, some still find difficult to abhor.Barry Keoghan is outstanding as the vengeful child seeking recompense for the perceived crime committed by Colin Farrell's character in an imaginatively told tale of retribution you rather hoped had disappeared some time ago but sadly hasn't.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 7 January 2023"," Oddness, on purpose: Yes, this movie is weird, and it's entirely intentional.Yorgos Lanthimos is an interesting Greek director who's been making English language films for a few years. The Lobster is so dry and oddball that I ended up kind of loving it. The Favourite I ended up loving because it was able to most effectively balance its weirdness with its characters (perhaps because he didn't actually write this script as opposed to everything else he's directed).The Killing of A Sacred Deer is the movie he made in between the two listed above, and I think it might be the weakest of the three. Good instead of very good, that is.So, let me talk about the weirdness. Everything about this movie feels stilted and mannered. It's off putting, especially at the beginning when you're trying to figure out what on earth the movie actually is. As the story progresses, though, it's easy to see the nefarious undercurrents running through every scene. We spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out where this unease originates from, and the fact that everyone is delivering unnatural dialogue unnaturally heightens the feeling.I've seen so many complaints of unnatural dialogue over the years. The one example strongest in my mind is around the movie Juno. The complaints of the mannered way in which characters spoke seemed to be a mask for complaints about the rest of the movie that people couldn't figure out how to express, so they picked on the dialogue. I'm not saying that criticism of such writing is invalid or always misdirected, but that did seem to be the trend I noticed and continue to notice in such criticisms. Just because dialogue isn't reflective of how people actually speak (I like to think of Mamet), that doesn't mean that the dialogue is a failure. Oftentimes, it's that way for a reason.Anyway, back to the movie. The sense of unease that permeates the film is great, and I kind of loved the film for about the first three-quarters. However, once the plot began to unravel and resolve, I felt like the movie lost some of its edge. When the main character is presented with his great moral choice (and his blackly comedic method for resolving it), I felt more removed from the choice than I should have. The build up is what works best in this movie, while the resolution just simply doesn't gel as well.Still, the movie's an odd but entertaining little thriller.~davidmvining rated 7/10 on 21 November 2019"

I've become a fan of director Ari Aster. Hereditary and Midsommar are both great movies in my opinion, even though they're not for everyone. He has shown that his style is very much out there and he just does whatever he wants. I admire that in a filmmaker, so I was eagerly awaiting his next outing, Beau is Afraid. Well, it's now playing in theatres and I think it's Aster's best and worst work to date. There's no denying this film is brilliantly well-made, but the actual presentation (story wise) downright baffled me, in good and bad ways. Here's why I really enjoyed watching it, even though it will never be a film I recommend.Joaquin Phoenix plays Beau, a man with an insane amount of anxiety. On the anniversary of his father's death, he has a plane ticket back home to visit his mother. Things prevent him from making his flight, which in turn leads to him slowly finding his way home anyways. That's the premise in a nutshell, but many other storylines are present as well. From confronting his demons through stage plays, crazy visuals, flashbacks, and some very creative practical effect work, Beau is Afraid is definitely one of the most unique films I've seen in a while. I loved watching this film, but didn't love it as a film overall.The best way I can explain how much I actually liked it is to say that I think it's a 5-star film on a filmmaking level, but about a 2-star film when it comes down to how effective the story is. I was eating up everything this film was giving me. My jaw was on the floor from how they pulled off certain sequences. I just wish the story became more clear by the end. I was very engaged, but even when the film felt like it was delivering answers, they also felt far too vague. The film plays as if it's giving you all the answers, but I was well aware it wasn't. I never felt frustrated while watching it, because I was loving the journey, but afterwards, I really had to think about whether or not the experience was enough for me. It was, but I have to admit it's not a great movie as a whole.Beau is Afriad isn't afraid to go all out in every scene. The studio that made this film (A24) also funded it as one of their most expensive films to date. The budget is used to its fullest potential here and the effort leaps off the screen. It's weird, visually stunning, and Phoenix's lead performance is stellar. Other than those aspects though, I was underwhelmed by the story. Still, if you're a film buff who likes to watch all movies, I recommend it, but to any casual viewer, I would say stay far, far away, it's probably not for you. It's a fantastic film to look at and follow along with, but it's simply not great otherwise in my opinion.~kjproulx rated 7/10 on 25 April 2023"," Think of it as a long nightmare: If you think of this movie as a nightmare it makes more sense. When you dream, your brain processes deep emotions and fears. Things like guilt, shame, childhood fears (spiders, strangers, water, the woods, etc.) and a lot of times the narrative is confusing and all over the place. This basically sums of the movie.It's hard to review or summarize, but essentially it's a journey into Beau's subconscious. Fear of sex, mommy issues, shut down emotions, and unresolved trauma.I sometimes gauge a movie based on how many times I think about it after I've seen it. For this one, I've been thinking about it all day. There are some really creative, artistic scenes and shots also that keep the viewer interested. Overall it's disjointed and way too long, and definitely not for everyone. 6/10.~zack_gideon rated 6/10 on 14 June 2023"," I feel like I just got punched in the face: What do I even say? I don't know. This movie broke my brain. I'm seriously stuck. It's been two hours and my mind is still racing.Like the headline, much of what I say may sound negative, but I mean it in the best possible way. This movie is indescribably weird, outlandish, absurd and insane. So many times I thought to myself, ""What am I watching?""This is dark comedy at it's finest. It's so messed up. And I was cracking up. Like everything else in this movie, it takes it to the extreme.The directing, cinematography and music work together to fully hypnotize me. It's so creative and imaginative with so many things I've never seen or could possibly imagine.Beau Is Afraid feels like four movies combined into one. That seems like a terrible idea. But each one is amazing. And they all work together. I don't understand how he did it. Ari Aster is clearly way smarter than me.There are long scenes of dialogue but I was fully glued. And there is usually other stuff going on during those scenes, like something funny in the background or interesting details in the set design. It made me even more engaged as I tried to catch everything.In an age where so many movies fail to stand out in any way, Beau Is Afraid stands out in every way. It's not for the faint of heart. I think some people will hate it. But if you've seen Hereditary or Midsommar, you know what you're in for. It's very different from them. But just like those movies, it'll remind you how much a great movie can affect you.(2 viewings, early screening IMAX 4/18/2023, IMAX 4/26/2023)~FeastMode rated 9/10 on 19 April 2023"," Not a story. A string of pathological metaphors.: Artistic styles come in two basic forms. You have your more lifelike art, which is meant to capture a moment in time through the imagination of the artist. The other is abstract art, wherein an artist has no intention of spoon-fooding you what to think, but is hoping to manipulate your feelings.And it's not binary. Most art falls into a spectrum somewhere in between those two extremes.If you've ever seen a David Lynch production like Eraserhead you'll recognize the abstract side of that spectrum, because you'll realize the futility of sorting out an actual plot. David Lynch, like sometimes directors David Cronenberg (Videodrome, eXistenZ, etc) and Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, etc) or writers like Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, etc), confuses reality on purpose and likes characters who roll with it, so that you have no choice but to roll with them. They have no intention of making sense. Their movies are often an attempt to throw off your sense of reality and ask you to simply except what you're seeing instead of try to understand it.Beau Is Afraid falls into that category, but nonetheless, I'm going to try to understand it anyway.This movie spends its entire time inside the mind of a man who clearly suffers from extreme anxiety, but it's hard to pin down what exactly it is that he's afraid of. And unlike movies like David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch, we're offered no obvious reason why Beau is seeing some of the weird things he sees. Is he schizophrenic? Maybe. Ari Aster does not want to answer that question, he wants you to ponder on multiple possibilities. And like most art that leans on the abstract side of the spectrum, each viewer is likely to reflect differently on it, and come up with their own answers (if any at all).From what I could tell, there were many clues in the movie that seem to imply that his anxiety disorder is caused by something sexual. A sexual trauma, perhaps. From graphic graffiti at in the earlier sequences, scenes where he is attracted to a girl his age but believes he will die if he has sex with her, and a creature his mother calls ""his father"" locked in an attic that is basically a monster made out of male genitalia, the movie is riddled with disturbing sexual references. (Not unlike something Cronenberg would do.)And his mother seems to be at the center of this problem. He behaves in a way that is constantly befuddled, and apparently victimized by every possible circumstance he stumbles into, but it all seems to have something to do with the way his mother treats him. Each sequence of the movie is another angle at the same problem, but in very different ways, and with perhaps red herrings to throw you off the scent.In one very key shot, apparently a flashback, there was a POV scene of him in a bathtub and the young girl he has a crush on is sitting at the side of the tub, she gets up and exits the frame, but the camera pans over to see his mother entering the frame from the same direction - and approaching his young self. (He is effectively outside of himself observing his relationship with his mother.) His mother tries to remove his clothes for bath time and he resists, asking for his father. (It's not clear why he wants his father. Certainly not to undress him. My feeling is it was for protection. Why would a boy his age need to be undressed by his mother?)The reason I think this is important is because I think the director is signaling to us that his mother might have sexually abused him through much of his childhood, and lied to him about his father and about his own sexual health in order to keep him tethered.But yet there was an earlier scene wherein he was imagining himself in a play where he actually found a wife and had kids with her, and occasionally this wife looked like a man. (This man, we learn later, is identified as Beau's father.) Beau spends an entire lifetime in this staged story looking for his lost wife and kids (who had disappeared after a terrible flood) and finally he meets up with his sons all grown up. That this was framed as a stage play is no accident. It was an imagined reality.Something about all that makes me think he had an intuition of being lied to all his life, and that his father represented the truth: that he could have a family all along. But we don't know what really happened to his father, and whether the man he met at the traveling theater was even real. Either way, his mother was very mean and impatient with him, and manipulative. She did not seem to approve of his natural interest in girls, and even seemed to enjoy watching him flirt with the idea of being with girls to see how it would play out.It was she who frightened him into a life-long resistance to find love in the arms of another woman. When he finally broke down and at least believed he had intercourse with that childhood crush, now grown up and played by Parker Posy, and did not die, we learn that his mother apparently observed (and probably set up) the entire thing. When the girl died (at least figuratively), his problem shifted from having fears of himself dying to a feeling of terrible guilt for ""killing"" the woman he loves - a role which I think his mother insists on filling.The final sequence was his trial, but unfortunately there was no redemption to be found here. Disappointingly, it appears he symbolically lost his battle with anxiety, false-guilt and low self esteem, and his mother won. No payoff to be found for the poor audience, who has sat through 3 full hours of this!All in all, I would have rated it higher if the film was about 1 hour shorter and his long, painful journey of self discovery and failure to stop the pattern of ""self incrimination"" and ""guilt"" due to probably sexual abuse was rewarded at the end with something happier, something psychologically triumphant. But it wasn't. It was like watching someone die of cancer and then die without fixing anything in his life. So why was I taken on this ride into hopelessness? It's not like Phoenix's Joker character which was a portrayal of a man who chose evil due as a response to his unfortunate medical condition and the cruelty of life. The character of Beau went absolutely nowhere and changed nothing. He just learned the truth about himself, and his mind judged him guilty despite all that.The movie is labeled a comedy and a horror, which is not quite accurate. It was satirical in many places, perhaps intending sarcasm about the violent world we live in. But it was neither that funny nor that scary. I'd have simply called it a psychological drama and satire.Phoenix is an absolutely amazing actor, but I would have advised him to take another look at the third act and insist on a stronger payoff.~CSHaviland rated 5/10 on 23 April 2023"," Interminably Long for What it Delivers, Which is Very Little...: If you lived in Beau's world you'd have nightmares all the time, as the characters and encounters round the bend they would entwine, there's confusion and blind panic, just about everyone is manic, and if they're not, they may have tendencies, that would leave you disinclined; as we journey through a life, or are we really on a trip, all heading to a funeral, or are we heading to some ship, where an emperor of metaphor, is exposed, disrobed and stripped, and you may feel, after three hours, you've been part of some grand trick.Bored to tears for the most part, although the performances are great, as you'd expect, but the relevance to me was close to zero and as such, it drowned in its own effluent.~Xstal rated 4/10 on 20 May 2023"," This curious and demented outing fails to justify its existence: If you think you've seen it all before, I can with great confidence say that after witnessing indie darling/horror upstart Ari Aster's newest epic Beau is Afraid, you're likely going to come away with a realization that you still had more to behold thanks to one of the most bizarre, self-indulgent, original and unfortunately frustrating movie going experiences of the modern era.Like Synecdoche New York, Being John Malkovich and The Odyssey joined forces in one seriously deranged tale of one man's quest to overcome his mommy issues and finally find peace in a world that seems hellbent on ensuring his life is a living breathing example of misery incarnate, Afraid shares a similar bloodline to Aster's previous two adored horror entries Hereditary and Midsommar but if you head into this indescribable feature expecting the same tone and scares as those two modern day genre classics you're going to be left hugely disappointed by Aster's newest venture, much like many unexpecting audience members will be left with jaws on the floor at what they just partook in.If you've seen the trailers for Afraid (once known as Disappointment Boulevard) you do get a feeling that the journey of Joaquin Phoenix's man-child Beau Wassermann is going to be one that blurs the line between what is real and what is not and there are certainly horrific moments within this tragi-comedy that are like nightmares come to life, especially in an extended early stretch of the film where Beau's life in the big city is hilariously and dementedly portrayed but there's really nothing that can prepare one for where Afraid is heading and how it does so.At it's core a simple tale about a boy/man whose life has been shaped and weighed down by mental issues caused by his upbringing at the hands of his single parent mother, Afraid is never once simply told as Phoenix is thrust into wild situation from wild situation that includes home care under the watchful eye of Nathan Lane and Amy Ryan's irksomely nice couple, a run in with a nomadic theatre troupe and a confrontation with his past, present and future and while everything that happens in Aster's tale is handsomely crafted and sometimes undeniably effective, far too much of Afraid doesn't hit with much of its self-indulgent three hour runtime feeling like a filmmaker allowed to take things too far with little care or thought for how viewers may feel about what they are partaking in.Front and center throughout is also a curiously off the boil performance from the usually great Phoenix.Likely playing things exactly how Aster wanted him too, Phoenix is left a mumbling, bumbling and gawking mess as the 50 something Wassermann and while early on his demeanor and mannerisms are tolerable and even understandable in certain respects, after a few hours Phoenix's turn begins to grate much like the film as a whole and while you lay in hope that Wassermann will shake himself from his pitiful way of life and the film will make everything ok in its final legs, come the films long-winded and unsatisfactory finale (the first time Aster hasn't knocked his ending out of the park) you question more than ever just what on earth Aster was hoping to achieve here?A likely candidate for a future cult classic that at the very least will cause much debate amongst the film community both now and into the future, Afraid still showcases a director we know to be a serious talent but there's far too much at play here that misses to call Afraid anything but a curious and unwieldly misstep that's reason for being is one big mystery.Final Say -Beau is Afraid is at the very least a unique and unpredictable experience but its excessive runtime, painful protagonist and unnecessary components combine to create an often arduous journey that may be expertly put together for the big screen but can't help save an indulgent exercise from its cold and hard to enjoy self.2 tins of paint out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)~eddie_baggins rated 4/10 on 3 May 2023"," Disappointing: Couple things:1. I don't like being negative about movies.2. I love when filmmakers and creators take big risks and make original, creative movies that we haven't seen anything like before. Watching directors take huge swings, even when they miss, is infinitely more compelling than safe mediocrity.That being said... I thought Beau is Afraid was terrible. I might even say... unwatchable.And that really disappoints me. I love seeing big risks pay off and love to champion those films, and I really hate having to say I didn't like a movie. I'd usually give a wildly original film like this the benefit of the doubt for taking a big swing even if it doesn't fully pan out... but to me, Ari Aster missed the mark in every possible way with this film. The film felt like it was someone telling you all the unnecessary details of a nightmare they had as you slowly lose interest. The story had no rhyme or reason, and stuff just kept happening that never made sense to me. I really admire the originality and the skill behind the camera - it is still a technically well-made movie, and Joaquin Phoenix really commits to the role. The movie does do a good job of immersing you in the psyche of its protagonist. But overall, it just did not work.This is a perfect example of when art-house cinema becomes too much - the movie is inaccessible. If I as a cinephile struggles to get through the third hour of the movie, I can't imagine what it must be like for a member of the general moviegoing public. Like, the first 45 minutes were promising, but everything after was almost unbearable. Nothing worked for me, and I even questioned whether I could sit through the rest of it. The movie is far too long and is a slog to get through. It is also so obnoxiously self-indulgent. I do need time to digest it and think about it, but overall my gut feeling is that this movie really did not work for me. To me, it was terrible, which is such a surprise since I thought Aster's previous films, Hereditary and Midsommar, were quite excellent (albeit disturbing).I see why this film is so divisive, and I am very upset to say that I ended up on the negative side on this one. It's 100% an original and unique movie - I've never seen anything quite like it......but maybe that was a good thing.~parksiet rated 5/10 on 27 April 2023"," You Must Conform to Beau's Norm: I remember seeing a headline a few weeks ago in which it was claimed that Ari Aster dropped some LSD before a premiere. I don't know if that's true or not, or whether he takes psychedelics at all, but the man walks around with an imagination that is perpetually, creatively tripping. Like a colorful virus, he infects audiences with ""Beau is Afraid"" - a mind-bending journey of a film which I wish many people would see, but could only realistically recommend to a short list of open-minded friends.This behemoth is a lot to digest in one sitting. It's not carried by its characters so much as it is by hypnagogic artillery fire of imaginative sets and set-pieces, most of which have rhyme and reason for existing but some, probably none. The actual plot consists of a paranoid man's surreal, Kafkaesque odyssey to appease his domineering mother. Beau (Joaquin Phoenix) lives in a world where his every decision is governed by assertive women, and every woman leads back to his mother. He's emasculated, directionless, and, as he points out himself, personality-less. The environments around him are nonsense to us. Strangers form theater troupes in the woods, seedy cities are filled with caricatures of real people; anyone's sentence can become a jarring non sequitur at any moment, and no event is guaranteed to be permanent. These depictions are of course exaggerated - but it's hard to separate what is and is not Beau's reality. It's like a strange dream, and the best comparisons I can make are to David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" or Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""But I've only described what this movie is like, and not WHY it is like. Plenty is up for interpretation. At the bottom line, however, is a creative director exploring themes of perceived guilt in awesome, if not totally bonkers ways. Anybody with a narcissistic parent will relate to parts of the film, as well as anyone who is unsure of themselves, or frets over every action (and inaction) they take. I think of Tyrion Lannister's line in ""Game of Thrones,"" defending himself in front of a father who hates him: ""I've been on trial my WHOLE LIFE."" Beau is literally put on trial for his whole life. There are people who feel this way about an extreme mother. I've got to believe Ari's speaking some personal truths here.People who saw it before me had mixed reactions - giddy, disturbed, exhausted, confused. I can empathize with all of these. Though Beau held my attention for the entire 3-hour runtime, his performance is draining. And it should be no surprise that the man behind ""Midsommar,"" ""Hereditary"" and ""The Strange Thing about the Johnsons"" locks this in with a good deal of shock value. His brand includes bringing out emotion through whatever means necessary, and it will turn some people off. My best advice is to give yourself completely to the experience. Don't try to follow the discombobulated world of Beau too closely, or you'll fall off a cliff every time. Sit back, enjoy yourself, and laugh where you can; there's maybe never been a more twisted humorist at work here.7.5/10 for reminding me of the time my dad showed me ""Mulholland Drive"" and I spent a week trying to decipher it.~aweynand96 rated 7/10 on 1 May 2023"," Mommy Issues: The Movie: Beau is Afraid is not a film. It is three hours' worth of the well-acted, stunningly presented garbled ramblings of a very unwell man masquerading as a feature film. Somebody go check on Ari Aster. He needs therapy and a hug.The plot (if one can call it that) starts out coherent and promising and quickly abandons any attempt at consistent logic, tone, pacing, or focus. Instead, we get dozens of plot and character threads that are introduced and either abandoned or sloppily concluded for shock value with little to no impact on character, themes, or events.Only one consistent thread remains present throughout the runtime: mommy issues. And it's clear that this project was Ari Aster vomiting his psychological maladies all over the page and just slapping it on the screen as a catharsis exercise.I give Aster credit for making something that is truly unlike anything else that exists on film, but there is a line where a filmmaker gets so stuck up his own anus that the finished product is inaccessible, irrelevant, meandering, and non-relatable to everyone else. And Aster crossed that line by several miles with this one.Hereditary was a fluke.~benjaminskylerhill rated 4/10 on 19 April 2023"," I'm not smart enough to fully understand it - but damn I loved it: Ari Aster might just be the best director working at the moment. His films are so unique. There is nobody else who feels remotely like what he creates. Both in terms of the way his movies are shot and also how they make you feel. 'Beau Is Afraid' is quite different to his first two films, but the class is still there and it's not a film I will be forgetting quickly.I love that A24 seems to give directors complete freedom to do crazy and ridiculous things with their films. You truly never know what is around the next corner in this film. Nothing is off limits and nothing would surprise me (but also every single thing surprised me).I'm going to have to brace myself to watch this again some time because it was just a little bit too much to digest in a single setting. Trying to appreciate each scene is exhausting enough, without completely understanding the overall message. I got it on the surface level (I think) but when you re-watch Aster's films you always pick up a million other little things.If you like original, daring and unique films then this will be right up your alley. It's not always an easy watch, but it is rewarding in its own bizarre way that I can't even quite explain. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 25 July 2023"

The shadow of Santa Claus. The punisher of naughty children. One Christmas a somewhat disfunctional American family have their lives ruined when a young boy summons him by accident. Many Christmas horror movies are slashers so Krampus makes a good alternative. This is a good combination of horror, fantasy and comedy. It certainly starts off with the emphasis on humour but becomes darker as it progresses. Although much of the cast is comprised of young kids I think it would be unsuitable for pre teen children. There are a few good jump moments plus plenty of on screen violence. A bit of swearing too. Credit to David Koechner and Conchata Ferrell, great performances delivering much of the humour. Toys coming to life reminded me of some horror movies from the 80's/early 90's. Trouble I found here is that much action takes place in the loft and there was too much going on in a confined space. Without giving it away there was a good twist at the end. I certainly would not call Krampus a classic Festive horror movie but it is better than many others, I enjoyed it.~Stevieboy666 rated 7/10 on 27 December 2018"," Good Film: Three days before Christmas, a suburban family gets together to celebrate the holidays.

Krampus takes a while to get into the swing of things, but once it does, it's non-stop fun, getting darker and darker as it goes on.Things start out light-hearted enough, with an amusing opening credits sequence that mocks the commercialism of Christmas, and the film continues in this manner up to the moment when disillusioned Santa fan Max (Emjay Anthony) tears up his letter to the jolly old man, an act that is as good as an invitation to Krampus and his helpers.From hereon-in, it's twisted entertainment, as the family (including their National Lampoon's Vacation-style relatives) are captured one-by-one by the horned, cloven-hoofed Krampus, a gang of wicked ginger-bread men, a massive jack-in-a-box, a terrible teddy, a creepy doll, and some nasty elves. Dougherty handles the action with skill, providing moderate scares and silliness in the vein of that other holiday comedy/horror classic, Gremlins.After a lot of enjoyable Chrimbo chaos, with Max's family all captured by Krampus, it looks as though Dougherty has run out of ideas with an 'it was all a dream' conclusion, but a final shot ensures us that all is not as it seems.While not quite in the same league as Gremlins (largely thanks to the slow start and a lack of Phoebe Cates), Krampus should provide those who struggle with seasonal cheer with a few ho-ho-hos and some memorable monster fun.~BA_Harrison rated 7/10 on 26 December 2017"," And all through the house, a whole damn bunch of creatures were stirring.: ""Krampus"", based on actual folklore in Germany and Austria, may not be without faults, but damn if it isn't a reasonably impressive new addition to the canon of Yuletide genre movies. It starts out as an obnoxious domestic comedy, as one family welcomes their grating relatives in for the holidays. Young Max, played by the very appealing Emjay Anthony, is so distraught by the friction between his kin that he destroys his letter to Santa and turns his back on the Christmas season. Big mistake: an imposing demon named Krampus makes it his mission to punish - make that SEVERELY punish - all those who lose their hopes and beliefs. Soon, horrible weather conditions presage an escalating series of terrors for Max and company.Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who also gave us a modern Halloween favorite in the form of ""Trick r Treat"", this is surprisingly engaging entertainment. However, it's not so much a horror comedy, as it is a full-blown horror movie with some moments of levity. Despite the PG-13 rating, it's not for the youngest members of your own family due to some incredible intensity. It does take on the tones of a nightmare.It does have its pleasures, such as a rich variety of ""monsters"", which are huge, hideous abominations of familiar toys and goodies. (This viewers' personal favorite was the anaconda sized Jack in the box.) There is some very potent atmosphere and quite a bit of macabre imagery filling up the 2.35:1 frame.How one responds to the protagonists will most likely affect how they respond to the film. Yours truly wouldn't have minded seeing almost everybody get theirs. Still, the actors give it 100%: Adam Scott and Toni Collette as Maxs' parents, David Koechner as the gun loving uncle, Conchata Ferrell as the grumpy great aunt, and Krista Stadler as the wise grandmother who knows the score, right from the start.A solid diversion overall, with some groan inducing dialogue and moments but quite a bit of energy & pizazz and a twisted nature.Seven out of 10.~Hey_Sweden rated 7/10 on 1 December 2016"," A Christmas scare that offers tons of fun for the audience: Sags a bit in the middle but Michael Dougherty's Christmas scare, 'Krampus,' still offers tons of fun for the audience.

The movie features strong acting all around with leads Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and David Koechner providing wonderful performances. 'Krampus' also features a wealth of fantastic effects, from the evil toys, to the elves, and especially Krampus himself.

Director Michael Dougherty, who also co-wrote the twisted and witty script with Todd Casey and Zach Shields, keeps the enjoyable story moving along at a quick pace, takes time to develop the colorful and distinctive characters, milks plenty of laughs from the wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor, ably crafts a strong feeling of isolation and vulnerability (the family are trapped inside their home by a fierce blizzard), generates a considerable amount of suspense, maintains a deliciously dark, yet playful tone throughout, stages the attack set pieces with skill and flair, and tops everything off with a surprising downbeat ending. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Adam Scott as meek workaholic dad Tom, Toni Collette as harried mother Sarah, Stefania LaVie Owen as the snippy Beth, Krista Stadler as wise and kindly grandmother Omi, Conchata Farrell as the sarcastic Aunt Dorothy, Allison Tolman as the mousy Linda, David Koechner as the crude uncle Howard, and Maverick Flack as the boorish Howie Jr. Kudos are also in order for Jules O'Loughlin's sharp widescreen cinematography, the dynamic shuddery score by Douglas Pipes, and the nifty practical special effects. Best of all, this movie even comes complete with a pertinent central message about the bitter spiritual price one must pay for giving up on the true spirit of the Christmas holiday.

The storyline follows a young man whose family seems to be falling apart and just in time for Christmas. He can't believe this is happening and decides to curse the holiday not knowing his actions may lead to a visit from the opposite of Santa Claus, Krampus, who hunts down bad boys and girls.This movie is directed by Michael Dougherty (Trick 'r Treat) and stars Adam Scott (Step Brothers), Toni Collette (Hereditary), David Koechner (Anchorman), Stefania LaVie Owen (The Lovely Bones), Conchata Ferrell (Edward Scissorhands) and the voice of Seth Green (Robot Chicken).This is far and away the best cast in a Krampus movie. The storyline is also the best written and executed and I loved how they delivered Krampus and his movements. The house running sequence is an A+ delivery of him and was very entertaining. Some of the closeup shots of him were uneven (I liked him better as a man than monster), but it didn't detract too much from the movie. This also has a solid conclusion.Overall this is definitely a must see and fun film. I'd score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.~kevin_robbins rated 7/10 on 16 December 2021"

While I liked that film I didn't love it, but I do love folk horror and THE WICKER MAN so I expected a lot from this one. Sadly, I didn't get it. MIDSOMMAR is a real mixed bag of a movie, with a decent first half. Florence Pugh gives a fine performance and the opening sequence is particularly powerful, getting off to a good footing. The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film.~Leofwine_draca rated 5/10 on 15 March 2020"," Midsommar murders.: Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first.~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 1 December 2019"," A surreal, but pretty awesome trip.: Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive.

It gets weird allright.The good: decent acting in a incredibly weird mindbending script.Not suited for casual viewers.~imseeg rated NA on 29 May 2022"," Meandering is right: MIDSOMMAR is the latest film from arthouse director Ari Aster, whose HEREDITARY wowed audiences a few years ago. While I liked that film I didn't love it, but I do love folk horror and THE WICKER MAN so I expected a lot from this one. Sadly, I didn't get it. MIDSOMMAR is a real mixed bag of a movie, with a decent first half. Florence Pugh gives a fine performance and the opening sequence is particularly powerful, getting off to a good footing. The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film.~Leofwine_draca rated 5/10 on 15 March 2020"," Midsommar murders.: Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first.~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 1 December 2019"," A surreal, but pretty awesome trip.: Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved.

When Evil Lurks (2023) - IMDb,7.0,Ezequiel Rodríguez|Demián Salomón|Silvina Sabater|Luis Ziembrowski|Marcelo Michinaux|Emilio Vodanovich|Virginia Garófalo|Paula Rubinsztein|Lucrecia Nirón Talazac|Isabel Quinteros|Desirée Salgueiro|Federico Liss|Ricardo Velázquez|Jorge Prado|Diego Sampayo|Pedro Larrabide|Cleo Díaz|Agostina Aguilera,Demián Rugna,Demián Rugna,"In a remote village, two brothers find a demon-infected man just about to ""give birth"" to evil itself. They decide to get rid of the body, only to end up unintentionally spreading chaos."," The only demonic possession film worth watching in 2023: This movie was insane!After being legitimately scared watching Runga's previous film Atterados, I knew that his follow up would up the ante and be even more brutal without shying away from what other directors wouldn't even attempt to show, but even I was shocked at the brutality shown in this film. I mean, was it too much? Some of the scenes were jaw dropping. I've honestly never seen some of the stuff shown in this movie EVER in my 30+ years as a fan of horror movies, and I hope they go over well with the majority of the audience as this new bar that was set and raised simultaneously is extremely high.If you think this a run of the mill demonic possession film, you would be sorely mistaken. There are no catholic priests or churches, no crosses or holy water, no head spinning or contortions (there is a little pea soup, but that's just because it's the easiest thing to feed someone who is comatose). There are no catholic demonic possession tropes to be found in this film, which is a HUGE breath of fresh air for one of the stalest subgenres in horror. It's a movie about demons possessing people like a virus, and they have their own set of rules as to how they are dealt with, and a very specific way of expelling them. Honestly, it's this type of fresh and novel approach to film making that makes Runga a standout where other movies seemed to fail so miserably (I'm looking at you, Exorcist; Believer). If more writers/directors took the time to take horror staples and twist them to make an original and unique creation, we would have a more vibrant and rich selection of horror movies.The standout of this film aside from the superb acting and the terrifying score, was the carnage and gore (as in, the use of practical special effects over CGI). It all looked so REAL. That scene with the dog was absolutely monstrous, and I shook my head in disbelief that anyone would have the gonads to show something that intense in a film. The movie rarely lets up, and you will be treated to jaw drop after jaw drop. Really, it's a spectacle, and one that is best shared with others just to see and hear their reactions.Overall, I couldn't recommend this film more if I tried. It's beautifully shot, well acted, the horror is intense and gore hounds will be pleased. It's original, it's fresh, it's dread induced as all get out. It's just a treat of a horror film and I urge anyone who loves the genre to see this movie. It deserves all of the success it will undoubtedly receive.~manuelasaez rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," Cancerous Evil: A rare film which will satisfy both the gore hounds and the cerebral, this hidden gem is going to earn a cult following.When Evil Lurks places us in a world where evil is so common place, it's become routine. Mundane and dismissible, this film explores the dangers of when people start to think bad things can only happen to other people, shared community and belief are lost, and the institutions put in place to protect us become complacent and disinterested.The rules for safety are clearly stated, but watch as each character's downfall comes from the thoughtless certainty that they are the exception and nothing will come of *them* doing it, just this one time.The unique demonic entities of this modern setting are alien to, yet play with, the tropes of just about every standard possession film: at once familiar and extremely inscrutable. Audiences are left to muddle through figuring things out as the protagonists do, and I strongly urge you to enter the film with as little knowledge as possible.Good for when you want a little thought to your gore, or a lot of gore in your thought, are tired of stereotypical Catholic-based possession films, and those who enjoy well-executed worldbuilding. You can expect high production values (you can practically *smell* the Rotted through the screen) and a balance between the brutal shocks and the lingering creepies.Those disturbed by the graphic harm of children or animals should steer clear.~blatherskitenoir rated 8/10 on 7 October 2023"," Demián Rugna has created another masterpiece for the horror genre: I watched the Argentinian horror film 🇦🇷 When Evil Lurks (2023) at the theater tonight. The storyline revolves around a pair of brothers and their friend who come across a demon-possessed body and are determined to eliminate it to prevent the infection from spreading through the village. However, this task proves to be far more challenging than they initially anticipated.Written and directed by Demián Rugna (Terrified), the film features Ezequiel Rodríguez (The Road), Luis Ziembrowski (The Rotten Link), Federico Liss (Wild Tales) and Demián Salomón (You Don't Know Who You're Talking To).Demián Rugna once again displays his mastery in crafting a unique and refreshing horror film. The storyline of this picture is exceptional and reminded me of Talk to Me in terms of plot, intensity, suddenness and shocking violence. The film delivers an array of incredible and relentless sequences that are both shocking and brutal. The kills are filled with gore, blood splatter, and unrelenting ruthlessness. The scenes involving the goat and children pickup at mother's house are a dream come true for horror enthusiasts. While the ending is somewhat open-ended, it works effectively.In conclusion, Demián Rugna has created another masterpiece for the horror genre. I would rate it an 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommending it.~kevin_robbins rated 8/10 on 13 October 2023"," Total and Complete Chaos: I know it's blasphemy, but I LOVED this possession horror movie way more than 1973's The Exorcist.Yes, I know. I'm in the 4% who doesn't prop The Exorcist up as the greatest horror movie ever made. I just recently watched that now-50-year-old movie only for the 2nd time and unbelievably, my rating dropped for it. (I explained IN DETAIL why in my review, so seek and find that for my thoughts.)This one gets RIGHT to the action with NO time spared. Immediately, you're thrust into the action and world-building. And let me get this straight: while I'm not fully understanding the ending at this point (I REALLY need to watch one of those ""Ending Explained"" YouTube commentators to fully grasp this finale,) I absolutely loved this tense, suspenseful and most of all, ORIGINAL tale of possession. Talk about NOT being spoon-fed this plot to the audience. You're gonna have to piece this one on your own.When Evil Lurks tells the tale of two brothers who will stop at nothing to protect their family and hopefully village/friends from an evil, travelling spirit hellbent on corrupting their isolated village, friends, family and livestock. Much like The Thing invading, how will they stop this threat before all their loved ones...or the WORLD...is demonized?I haven't seen such a bold, in your face, right-away horror that demands your attention and put the pieces together yourself in such a long time. You are in the almost-the-same shoes as these characters with trying solve the riddle and save everyone involved. And the fact that no one is safe while you try and solve this riddle, including children, you better act fast.I loved this movie even without fully understanding the ending for now. Either those ""Ending Explained"" YouTube vids will open my eyes, or I'll do it on my own from future revisits. With any route, Director/Writer Demián Rugna did an EXCELLENT job of opening a new door of horror.***Final Thoughts: YES, this movie is from Argentina and has subtitles. Suck it up. Some of the best horror films are outside the system. Especially serious horror.~thesar-2 rated 8/10 on 28 October 2023"," Evil loves children and children love evil.: This Argentinian gem narrates the story of Pedro who along with his brother Jaime comes across a rotten body of a man who is possessed by a demon. He is about to give birth to it and the brothers not only have to stop the birthing but also ensure not to kill the Kan as it might spread the possession. With the authorities refusing to help and a mistake leading to the spread, it is upto the brothers to safeguard their family and also stop the demon. Will they succeed forms rest of the story.I already used the word ""gem"", so adding onto that, this is by far the best horror film to release this year and I thoroughly loved it. There is no time spent on believer and non-believer, as the story is established in such a way that the characters believe the scenario of an unborn demon about to get unleashed and that alone helps sell this story. The director doesn't waste any time in getting on with the story as the brothers discover the rotting man soon and hell breaks loose thereafter.With constant supply of scares and gore even when the film is devoid of any jumpscares, as the narrative doesn't want to resort to such gimmicks. It's a run for survival rather than fight for survival till the final act and that works the best. By the tike the final act begins, the film throws in more surprises amidst the inevitable outcome. Kudos to the make up team as well, to help elevate those not easily digestible scenes. I liked the fact that the narrative held my attention from start to finish. For this, I would strongly recommend this as a must watch to everyone.~chand-suhas rated 8/10 on 31 October 2023"," Absolutely stellar and near-flawless genre effort: Following a bizarre discovery, a group of residents in a small Argentine town are confronted by a wide-sweeping curse that turns the other residents into savage, bloodthirsty creatures intending to create chaos around them and must find a way of stopping it from spreading out of the town.This was an absolutely entertaining and chilling genre effort. One of the strongest elements here with this one is the massively intriguing storyline that takes a different twist on the possession idea. Rather than deal with a singular individual taking on the role of the possessed and the terrors of that being unfolded throughout the course of the film, this takes place with the concept of the town being able to get possessed and carry out the violence themselves in terms of just snapping and going crazy on those around them seemingly out of nowhere. That not just people but also animals are capable of succumbing to this possessed state is a fantastic concept and generates a kind of fantastic starting point that leaves a chilling atmosphere to carry itself over the rest of the film. As well, that leaves the film with a slew of breathless and wholly disturbing scenes of the townspeople coming together in random attacks or encounters. From the first encounter in the field outside the couple's house where they have to shoot the possessed goat and take turns gruesomely attacking each other for what they've done, this starts off fast and vicious with the possessed generating more encounters and confrontations in rapid succession. The antics at the farmer's house where he tries to explain the situation to his estranged wife and new partner only to have the issue escalate when both animals and the possessed humans come together to try to take each other out in graphic fashion out of nowhere is a spectacular, breakneck sequence that absolutely shreds the nerves with the paranoia and dread established at this point. This provides the setting for the finale where the slight break in pace manages to generate the necessary gaps in the storyline to be filled and the race to ensure they put an end to everything that takes place. The need to go back into town and confront the creatures still there leads to some enjoyable encounters on the highway or the school where the main threat is hidden away infecting the rest of the children there is quite well-explained and generates the kind of overall storyline necessity to explain what's happening and generate the kind of necessary action to keep going throughout here. There's plenty of bloodshed, carnage, gut-wrenching emotional resolutions and a fantastic ending coda that suits the material perfectly and either lets the film work as a solo vehicle or a chilling preview of what's to come in a potential sequel. The other factor here is the idea of how the possession works and spreads throughout the village. The initial discovery of the lone individual living on the remote farmhouse where the gruesome, deformed state they find him in and how the others treat him is a fantastic start to things. It's the way it starts from there involving the family relationships with the individuals possessed and the reluctance to deal with what's obvious which is what lets the idea spread through their inactivity that comes together quite nicely. If there's a flaw to be had here with this one, it's the stupidity of the finale where a series of utterly unnecessary series of poor decision-making skills that shouldn't be there due to everything that's happened before so it comes off as useless contrivance to continue the story but that's really all that's wrong here.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence including against children, Graphic Language, and Brief Nudity.~kannibalcorpsegrinder rated 10/10 on 11 October 2023"," Don't believe the hype.: When a case of demonic possession threatens to spread throughout the area, Pedro (Ezequiel Rodríguez) attempts to get his family to safety, but being an idiot, he only succeeds in exposing them to the evil.I had heard very good things about Argentinian horror When Evil Lurks so I was excited to watch it, but I seem to be in the minority in finding it disappointing. Sure, there are a couple of memorable sequences (the dog attacking the little girl being the obvious one), but the script is extremely muddled, introducing a lore and a set of rules for its demonic possessions that are inadequately explained (if at all).What causes the possessions? What exactly is a 'rotten'? What is a 'cleaner' and what is that metal contraption they use? Why can't the possessed be shot? Why can't electricity be used? Where are the police and the army while all of this is going on? So many questions, but writer/director Demián Rugna never fills us in on the details; while I don't need everything spelled out for me, this film is a case of too little information, making it a frustrating watch (for me, at least).Some of the special effects are reasonable, but the film is hardly the gore-drenched masterpiece that I had been led to believe it is.~BA_Harrison rated 4/10 on 7 November 2023"," Frustrating and bloody brilliant: Don't pay heed to the negative reviews here questioning the main protagonists irrational decision making in the film. It is indeed frustrating, but that's in the film by design and not as a plot armour. The main protagonist is a loser, in fact it's his decision to play hero that kick starts this whole process of him destroying his family and everyone around. It is mentioned throughout the movie how much of a moron he is, trying to kill his autistic son and abandoning his family. So, yes, not surprised that he makes dumb decisions when faces with adversity. The movie can be linked to so many relevant social issues like corona, or the plague, or pollution etc. There is also enough gore and violence to keep you hooked. One of the best horror movies I have seen in recent times. Please give it a watch with an open mind.~alphadude007 rated 8/10 on 29 October 2023"," there's no point in praying: Right off the bat, not even 10 minutes into the film Cuando acecha la maldad (When Evil Lurks) hook us into, what i first i thought, is a body horror. And oh boy, they really don't shy away from the violence and gore. It's amazing that even with the 'shocking' beginning, this film manage to gets even progressively gruesome.It's well acted (shout out Ezequiel Rodríguez ), beautiful cinematography, an overall well-made film with a sprinkle of poignant family drama. Though it's a genuinely scary film, it's noticeably flawed. It weirdly paced, (which i personally don't mind). At times, It can be somewhat unclear of what's really going on as we learn the 'rules' as the film goes.But despite its fuzzy script, WEL is still a decent film with some nice twists and definitely one of the better horror films of the year. I watched Demián Rugna 's interview on how he tried to push the limit of what could happened in horror films, and i think he did it in this film.8/10.~exlana rated 8/10 on 27 October 2023"," Wasn't flawless, but I loved it like it was.: First Spanish movie I've seen. It wasn't the most finely crafted film but I loved it because it brought something new. I watched ""The Exorcist: Believer"" on the same night, which felt better made but formulaic. This felt incredibly new and invigorating, like a breath of fresh air, as I like to say. This was mainly because, in most horror movies, nobody believes in the supernatural events happening, but in ""When Evil Lurks,"" everyone in the village believed it wholeheartedly, EXPEDITIOUSLY lol, no questions asked, which was a wild to me.Start is nice, very engaging. Also the tagline ""there's no point in praying"", was great. I don't speak Spanish, so I watched with subtitles. When watching a foreign language film, it's often one of two things: you either lose interest because you're concentrating on understanding the dialogue, or you become more engrossed in the story, focusing the subtitles. I'n the latter. Also, it's hard to judge the acting when you're focused on the bottom of the screen half of the time, but I think this actually helped in this case.The film masterfully builds the atmosphere, it's tense, not entirely like a traditional horror, the characters exude a war veteran vibe, and the fact that it's set in a superstitious village adds to the intrigue.The type of possession shown is novel to me. The use of the term ""the cleaners"" to refer to the hired exorcist/hitman is still a mystery - perhaps it's lost in translation. Like many elements in the movie, I wished for more explanation. You get an idea, but it's just that - an idea.The film isn't unsettling to watch as a whole, but some of the ""sick"" characters are genuinely disturbing. Despite all the talk about the dark and eerie superstitions in the movie, I wouldn't classify it as extremely scary.There are so many superstitions, and the movie assumes we already know about them. Guessing drawn from Argentinian folklore, which adds to the enigmatic quality of the film. It serves the movie in some ways, doesn't in others. I was so invested because I wanted to delve into all the supernatural folklore the movie revolved around, but it does take its time.Some of the characters make illogical decisions, and they occasionally take forever to see what's right in front of them. It can get seriously frustrating, especially in the third act when the tension reaches its peak. I would have loved the movie so much more if it weren't for those aggravating choices, particularly from the two bumbling brothers who can't seem to follow instructions.This could have been a far better movie if they had chosen a more logical route to reach the same conclusion. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I adored how it injected novelty into the horror genre. It may not be a cinematic masterpiece, possibly a 6 out of 10 objectively, but its captivating and unique qualities made it a 10/10 for me compared to most horror movies I've seen in recent years.~AfricanBro rated 10/10 on 11 October 2023"
The Meg 2: The Trench (2023) - IMDb,5.0,Jason Statham|Jing Wu|Shuya Sophia Cai|Cliff Curtis|Page Kennedy|Sergio Peris-Mencheta|Skyler Samuels|Melissanthi Mahut|Whoopie Van Raam|Kiran Sonia Sawar|Felix Mayr|Sienna Guillory|Tao Guo|Robin Hill|Lele Dai|Ivy Tsui|Stewart Alexander|Xiong Jinji,Ben Wheatley,Jon Hoeber|Erich Hoeber|Dean Georgaris,"A research team encounters multiple threats while exploring the depths of the ocean, including a malevolent mining operation."," For Statham and creature feature fans only: Meg 2: The Trench opens with what seems like a fun scene that would have been deleted from a Jurassic Park sequel for being too ridiculous and overly CGI heavy. It's followed by what seems like a hilariously goofy deleted scene from the first Transporter movie, with Jason Statham beating up nameless bad guys on a container ship. At every opportunity, Meg 2 is trying hard to please the audience with action beats, character archetypes, and scenarios that they've seen before. Half the time, this sequel simply hits similar notes as its 2018 predecessor. Despite this laziness and lack of originality, the movie still has its odd charms, making it pretty hard to hate, even if it's hard to fully appreciate on any real artistic level.As with the first film, the best thing Meg 2 has going for it is Jason Statham. Even if he may not be the best judge of scripts, Statham is still the absolute best action star Hollywood has. He has the physicality, acting chops, and charisma to make even the weakest of his films worth watching. Without Statham, Meg 2 probably wouldn't rank above a 3 or 4 out of 10, but Statham gives it his all with a so-so script and manages to make the overly long two-hour creature feature better than it would have been otherwise. The rest of the supporting cast does what they can with their roles. Nobody outright embarrasses themselves with the mediocre material.Story-wise and artistically, The Meg is the superior entry in the Meg franchise. While not necessarily a bad film, Meg 2 definitely has its fair share of dead spots, with a lot of the first hour seeming like it could have ended up on the cutting room floor. The second hour is much stronger, emphasizing the (PG-13) carnage and attacks the audience wants out of a shark flick. The film is never an absolute bore, though it's disappointing that director Ben Wheatley didn't lean more into the B-movie nature of the first ten minutes. Both Meg movies would have benefited greatly from an R-rating, though the fact that both are super CGI heavy and relatively bloodless without ever playing like Syfy originals is probably a minor miracle.Ultimately, Meg 2: The Trench isn't super memorable. It doesn't tell a particularly strong story or ever really justify its existence as a sequel. However, the opening scenes and the second half delivers the kind of mindless action spectacle one would want from a cheesy sci-fi adventure like this. In the end, it's strictly for Statham and creature feature fans only. Anyone else is likely to find it a complete waste of time. 5/10.~jellyneckr rated NA on 1 October 2023"," The Only Good Thing Is Jason Statham: I wanted to like this, I really did, it has everything, giant creature, Statham, shark, but this is just so boring.The problem is, it hits every cliché. Annoying kid, paint by the number villain, a predictable plot. Unlikable characters who all behave like cartoon characters.I liked the first movie and was looking forward to the sequel, but the irritating characters and lazy [;it just didn't do it for me.I don't mind popcorn movies where you park your brain at the door, but they are usually fun. I think that is the problem here, it just was not fun. Statham is the best thing about this movie, he always turns in a reliable performance. The rest of the cast are so forgettable, in the end I was cheering for the shark.If I want a good shark movie, I will watch Jaws.~ladymidath rated 3/10 on 4 November 2023"," Things we learned from Meg 2! :): A 14 year old girl is a serious scientist and will have a multi million dollar underwater suit made in her size.Said multi million dollar underwater suits can withstand pressure from being at 7 km depth but not the teeth of a big eel.Jason Statham can swim at 7 km depth without a suit and not get crushed.Trained mercenaries with automatic rifles are no match for pre-historic crocodiles that walk on land for the first time.When people arise quickly from 7 km depth no decompression is necessary since the subs are state of the art.Submarines can freely submerge and sail right next to several Megs who won't try anything but if you try to go UP from an underwater station, they will attack right away.Turning on the lights in an underwater station will cause Megs to tear it apart within seconds but building it in the first place was fine by them.Escape pods from an underwater station are never attacked by Megs, only actual submarines.Working with underwater mining in a mini sub every day will not cause Megs to attack you, only if the main character is in that sub.Even if you are backed up by money, armed mercenaries, and an inside (wo)man who can easily fix it if your secret underwater operation gets discovered you kill your friends/employees and risk your own life in a huge series of explosions that will most likely bury you and your sub alive, just to get some action.Megs carry grudges and will ignore a lot of people for a chance to attack a big metal helicopter to get 1 guy they don't like.The black movie guy kliché is still alive and kicking.Megs will only swim up beyond the natural cold barrier if the people they hate are going up there, even if there has been a big hole for them for hours.If a Meg chases a small vessel, it will ignore all other bigger and noisier vessels in it's hate for the main character.A huge octopus will fail to hold a Meg, if the Meg manage to bite 1 tentacle.A newly engaged young woman is eaten by an octopus without the audience batting an eye lash but the annoying little dog must survive since people will be enraged if it dies.Mercs will have devices and know how to jam all cell phones on an island (but struggle with simple combat).A man can hang on the outside of a mini sub from 7 km down and all the way up to the surface with absolutely no problems with pressure, air or taking off the suit at surface level.Seeing an empty helmet float around at 7 km depth means you should go look for your colleague because ""you can't leave him behind"", he will definitely not be dead or eaten.Jason Statham can hold on to a piece of helicopter debris even though a Meg lands on top of it, he is the main character after all.Billion dollar underwater stations have no emergency handles or controls, anyone from the surface can take over remotely and completely.If you are walking to an underwater station and running out of air, you should stop to talk often, or at least slow down and enjoy the view.If you hold a Meg in a tank, a flimsy gate will hold in it check for years until it decides it want babies.If you care about the oceans you will live in a container for days before you emerge when the ship is at sea, not to catch them red handed when they dump radioactive waste or take pictures of them dumping it at sea but to take pictures of their log book, to perhaps sue them later and hope it will stop them next time. Simply taking the pictures when they reach port would rob you of living in a container for days.~erik-29-381626 rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," It's a big megalo-don't!: Horror auteur Ben Wheatley goes Hollywood with Meg 2: The Trench. I don't blame the guy for trying -- after all, this is the kind of blockbuster that, if done right, could propel a director into the big league -- but it's clear from the start that Wheatley is way out of his depth on a film of this magnitude.I wasn't expecting anything more than a fun brainless blockbuster, but while Meg 2 is undeniably brainless, it isn't much fun. The first half of the film takes place mainly underwater, in subs, in a deep sea mining facility, and on the ocean floor, as tough guy Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) and his marine research pals explore the titular trench, fall foul of sabotage, and are attacked by a variety of hungry sea creatures. Unfortunately, Wheatley clearly has no idea how to handle a big action scene, meaning that following what is going on is nigh on impossible. I saw the film in 3D, and the wearing of the glasses made the picture really murky, which only added to my confusion.The action eventually moves to the surface, with Jonas and his friends escaping numerous gun-toting bad guys, before doing battle with three Megs, a giant octopus and some dog-sized dinosaurs that have made their way to a nearby island resort. Up until then, things had been dumb, but what follows is off-the-scale stupid, with characters acting in the most unlikely manner, zero sense of logic, and a general feeling that the director has bitten off more than he can chew.3/10.~BA_Harrison rated 3/10 on 9 August 2023"," Spies, corporate espionage and super-suits (spoilers after a warning): From my review for Jurassic World Dominion: ""If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs.""Now just switch ""dinosaurs"" with ""giant sharks"" and you have Meg 2: The Trench. If you're here for a creature feature, you will be disappointed. At least 80% of the movie has zero to do with sharks.It starts with a fight scene that seems like it should be in a Bourne movie. I wondered, am I in the right place? Then we're introduced to super-suits that can break boulders. What movie is this again? There is a fully useless espionage subplot. Where am I???Meg 2 is ridiculously dumb. The action is mostly gibberish and impossible to see. I couldn't even tell which characters were dying. The story is useless. There are so many cheesy moments. The attempts at jump scares are laughable. Like, are you even trying?You never feel the stakes. At one point the characters are in a dire situation that will be extremely difficult to survive. Their lives are all in danger, and yet they walk around in wonderment and awe like they're on a fun adventure.This movie made me laugh a lot. But only a couple times was it intentional. It's 8 stars on the So Bad It's Good scale. If you liked the first one, you might enjoy it. But I don't recommend it unless you want to laugh at how bad it is.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 8/3/2023)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSA few things I remember that I couldn't believe, to the point of laughter.(1) The villain guy in the trench facility has Statham unconscious but doesn't kill him. I think, maybe there's a reason he needs him alive. But that would already conflict with the previous scene where the villain woman asks someone to kill Statham. And even worse, as soon as Statham wakes up, they start fighting. And it's clear that the villain guy is trying to kill Statham.They could have at least tried to make sense. Maybe tie him up to interrogate him and Statham is able to escape. Then it wouldn't be so glaring. But no, it's just atrocious writing and they hope you won't notice or care.(2) Two good guys armed with a taser and mace are able to beat five bad guys armed with automatic rifles. I kid you not. And it's not like they had the element of surprise. The bad guys knew where they were. Made me laugh so hard.(3) There is a character named Rigas who at one point seriously considers killing Statham to save herself. Later she begs Statham to seal the hatch and leave a team member behind to die. Then the movie has the gall to give her this line with regards to Statham's adopted daughter: ""I'll protect her with my life.""She is literally the last non-villain in the movie who I would trust her with. She is more likely to sacrifice the daughter to save herself. Even after this we see her put another friend in danger by running and leaving him behind. I thought they were setting her up to die, but nope. Horrible character.(4) The super rich head boss villain lady is sitting in the chopper waiting to leave a highly dangerous situation. She's completely fine with killing innocent people, a character we'd likely see abandoning her henchmen to ensure her safety. Yet when she hears a noise, she tells the pilot to go investigate.Let me repeat that. She sends the pilot, the only one who can fly the chopper, out to investigate in a scenario where people are getting eaten by giant lizards. I can't do it, man. It's too dumb to handle.(5) I know this is supposed to be a light and fun movie, but these characters just watched, nay, experienced numerous friends and team members dying. And yet they are celebrating, toasting, and making jokes at the end. Not even a moment to remember the fallen?There is so much more, I just can't remember. Probably because it's so forgettable.EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention Statham swimming at the bottom of the ocean without a super-suit. They give you some explanation that sounds like complete nonsense. You just have to fill your sinuses with water??????? How do you do that? Even if you can... how do you prevent your lungs from collapsing? They could have easily written around this. It's just lazy.~FeastMode rated 2/10 on 4 August 2023"," DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH PAINT DRY INSTEAD: Don't believe these fake reviews by probably paid, semi-professional writers who say the movie is good.

There is no excitement or suspense, no characters one can relate too (at least I couldn't), and compared to fine ""shark movies"" like Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, Open Water or The Shallows, this one is not B-league but C-league, despite some production value. Also, some well done CGI is no news anymore for quite some time and not very entertaining if the rest of the movies is just crap. I really would prefer to put some of those good old Godzilla themed movies of the 50s and 60s back on my screen (and have some fun) instead of watching this, well, void of boredom ever again. I really like some of the movies starring Jason Statham, but as I don't watch (and like) Fast & Furios movies (the last one I watched was the third entry) the last really good one I can remember was that little movie Homefront, a movie made 10 years ago - simply put, I would prefer to get more class and less mass.~Tweetienator rated 3/10 on 26 August 2023"," Just Bad: The first impression of The Meg 2: The Trench (2023) is that this was hard to watch. There were dumbfounded scenes that did not make any sense led by decision making. The kills were not that good especially since it is a PG-13 movie. The only parts that I liked are Jason Statham and his great acting and the antagonists getting killed off. Other than that, I was ready to leave the theater. It really questioned me on how does the protagonists keep on surviving after questionable events. I honestly liked the first one better because it was not that bad of a shark movie. The sequel, however, just made it worse. I am surprised that this film was allowed to make it in Dolby Cinema since it only allows good or great movies in the auditorium. Overall, The Meg 2: The Trench is pretty bad with its scenes and kills.

NONE of that.Only the big shark looks a little bit daunting, but we only get to see the big beast a few times, but most of the time there are lots of other smaller (cgi) croccodile like creatures that are now attacking Jason Statham, which dont look daunting at all!Fail nr 3:This is one heck of a cheaply made sequel, with many (MANY) below average B-movie actors. They bore me. The special effects look cheap as well. They bore me.Fail nr 4:I should not expect a serious, credible storyline with such a summer action spectacle, but there are limits to my tolerance of stupidity of the script.Not any good then?The only good thing to say about it, is that there are lots of loud sounds and lots of fast moving images, so I didnt fall asleep...~imseeg rated 4/10 on 6 August 2023"
The Menu (2022) - IMDb,7.2,Ralph Fiennes|Anya Taylor-Joy|Nicholas Hoult|Hong Chau|Janet McTeer|Paul Adelstein|John Leguizamo|Aimee Carrero|Reed Birney|Judith Light|Rebecca Koon|Rob Yang|Arturo Castro|Mark St. Cyr|Peter Grosz|Christina Brucato|Adam Aalderks|Jon Paul Allyn,Mark Mylod,Seth Reiss|Will Tracy,"A young couple travels to a remote island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the chef has prepared a lavish menu, with some shocking surprises."," A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today: From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger. As the chef pointed out, they didn't try hard enough to fight back. It was as if they all had already accepted the menu. In the final scene, you can see some of them even thanking chef.Though some of them tried to escape, they didn't fight back. Margot fought back, against the menu, by sending it back and being authentic with herself and then with the chef.~redbeardceltic rated 10/10 on 13 January 2023"," A completely bonkers and over-the-top, yet perhaps brilliant satire: This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.I won't spoil anything with a synopsis, but rather try to intrigue anyone on the fence about seeing this movie.The Menu has something fresh and interesting to say about the tired conversation surrounding the marriage between art and artist. There are some very clearly illogical and confusing elements of the plot that you can easily miss if you're taking it at face value.Overall, this movie isn't meant to be a sensible, coherent and satisfying thriller. Instead, it's a comment on a poignant phenomenon in our society: the way we view, consume, pursue, and ultimately obsess over those who produce the art around us. Sure, the movie is about a chef and his meticulous menu, but in reality the larger point is about the production of any type of art, namely filmmaking.It seems to me that the filmmaker is making a very focused point about the state of movies nowadays. There seems to be a constant theme throughout about how often artist and their fans seem so detached from each other, even though their mutual approval of the art should be enough to bring them together.An absolutely bonkers second act and a considerably more bonkers third act wrap up what I believe to be a masterpiece commentary on the state of filmmaking in 2022. The only moneymakers are massive superhero movies, massive studio A++ list celebrity movies, etc, and the makers of this film ask one simple question:How long until we collectively call out their BS and ask for some simple bread?The movie makes you question how far you'd go into ""buying into the hype"", and conversely has a quite shocking commentary on those who consistently stay away from ""the hype"" without buying into it. Think of some of the ridiculous fashion trends that some of the highest brands in clothing perpetuate, and just how many people will blindly follow simply because there is an LV or GG stamp on it.It's no shock to me that a script with this kind of tonal shifting comes to us from the writers/directors of Succession. So much of the way this film is crafted reminds me of the show. Sharp wit, sarcasm that lies somewhere between funny and cringeworthy, twists, turns, and of course, the oh-so subtle thumbing of the nose at all the socially accepted, yet fundamentally insane reverence for brilliance that we hold dear.As a movie-lover, this was one of the more thought provoking pieces of the year. This movie makes you wonder what the line is between brilliant artist and insane psycho. The movie makes you look around and find yourself in the all the characters; the artist, the art, and those who are (literally) consuming it.All in all, this movie is an insightful parody of the state of not only the word of fine dining, but also fashion, art, filmmaking, music, etc. I might have a completely wrong reading of this movie, but hey, that's what art's about, right?~naregian rated 8/10 on 18 November 2022"," One of the most unique theater going experiences I've had in a long time: This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.What set this film apart from other thriller, horrors are great performances and great writing. Every character here is well done and intelligently written. The entire cast gives great performances with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy truly being the standouts as they playoff each other very well.Each character purposely reflected a personality type that if you ever worked in service you would encounter and come to know very well. To my fellow service employees you know what I'm talking about.What really stuck with me long after the credits have rolled is the commentary this film has on society. At it's core I believe this film to be about a Chef who's long career facing multitudes of people both customers and critics has affected his passion for his art. It's here where I also believe to be the film makers commentary on what it is to be an artist in this films case a Chef. It felt to me what the film makers are saying is as artists they pour their heart and souls into their art and craft both to serve and entertain us and as consumers it's very easy to lose appreciation for that hard work and effort.But I digress, perhaps I'm over thinking things and this film is not very deep as I seem to believe it is. Nonetheless this film was quite unique, thrilling, and entertaining. It's films like these that remind me of why I go to the theater and why I fell in love with storytelling and cinema.IMDb: 8/10Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters.~nscoby93 rated 8/10 on 18 November 2022"," The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.: The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry.~Paragon240 rated 5/10 on 22 November 2022"," Nice Try, But the Satire Doesn't Land: Nice try, but the satire doesn't land in this film that skewers pretentious foodies and the chefs who cook for them.There's already been one satire this year that savages the rich, ""Triangle of Sadness,"" and that's a much better film than this one. I'm ok with an outlandish premise, but if you're going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they're in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next. The tone doesn't stick to one or the other, so what was probably intended to be cutting instead falls flat.The ending especially is silly. It definitely did not leave me wanting s'more.Grade: C+~evanston_dad rated 6/10 on 2 December 2022"," 🍲The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution 🍛: And that's all Folks, that's all you need to Know.

There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.While the plot is pretty original (which normally scores high points with me) and while the film is at times quite beautiful to look at, it altogether missed the main point of a good meal: gratification.Scares are not included on the menu; comedic value is barely there; it is unsatisfyingly light on gore; hints of interesting dialogue exist, but they are scantily peppered throughout; the characters as well as their backstories, are as distinctly unpalatable, as are their intentions nondescript; it wore on and became progressively less, instead of more enjoyable; and the main course was both 'cheesy' and less than fulfilling. By the time dessert was to be served, the previous dishes laid still undigested and leaden.I'd like to speak to the manager, please.~Her-Excellency rated 6/10 on 20 November 2022"," Great satire: The Menu isn't the first to satirise the rich and their incompetence and isn't saying anything new but that definitely doesn't prevent it from being a great satire that pokes fun at everything it can in ways that are often consistently funny, playful and extremely stylish.Ralph Fiennes gives a terrific performance full of awkward unease that only enhances his commanding screen presence. Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect audience surrogate amongst a sea of deliberately unlikeable characters of which the best is Nicholas Hoult whose almost too good at making his character hilariously pathetic.Mark Mylod's direction is excellent, the film has more than enough visual style to match the pretentiousness of its characters and is really good at building tension. The music by Colin Stetson is fantastic, striking a unusual balance between beautiful and unnerving.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 18 November 2022"," I tried to chew but couldn't swallow: ""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end. ""The Menu"" could have given us something to chew on, instead I walk out of the movie theater scratching my head.~julieshotmail rated 6/10 on 24 November 2022"," The Menu Lacks Flavor: I saw all the glowing reviews for this movie, so I was expecting a winner. But this menu lacked flavor.Problems with this movie: Nobody you cared about; why did Chef decide to do this final menu; why did everyone believe in his cause; how were these people who came that 'bad' or deserving of their fate; why would he tell at least one of them what he was planning; and what was the point of setting up a fake coast guard, how did he know that would even be needed; what was the point of having his mother there; how does the protagonist not only figure out how to start up the boat but also pilot it in the dark.The movie had good pacing, but the direction this film was going, even who would survive in the end, was way too obvious early on.

Pearl (2022) - IMDb,7.0,Mia Goth|David Corenswet|Tandi Wright|Matthew Sunderland|Emma Jenkins-Purro|Alistair Sewell|Amelia Reid|Gabe McDonnell|Lauren Stewart|Todd Rippon|Grace Acheson,Ti West,Ti West|Mia Goth,"In 1918, a young woman on the brink of madness pursues stardom in a desperate attempt to escape the drudgery, isolation, and lovelessness of life on her parents' farm."," Twisted, poignant, and macabre by turns: ""Pearl"" is Ti West's followup to the 1970s-set ""X"", which serves as an origin story for that film's villain. It focuses on her life as a lonely and whimsical young woman who feels stifled by her obligations caring for her family in 1918 Texas while her husband serves in World War I. Pearl's only outlet is the local cinema, where she is invigorated by the glamour of motion pictures and dreams of being a star. Pearl's longing for a more thrilling life--along with some ostensibly psychological predispositions to insanity--drive her to do some unspeakable things.Though branded as a ""Technicolor slasher"" of sorts, ""Pearl"" is, in truth, more of a twisted psychological family drama, and a character study of a deeply sad outsider who feels her life is slipping away from her; her dreams, desires, and impulses out of reach due to her circumstances. This theme was tapped upon in ""X"", which showed the character at the end of her life, and this exploration of where she came from is demented and poignant by turns. The film is notably effective because this existential theme is one that is endemic to being a human--a fear for many that, no matter where we are in our lives, is ever-present--all of the ""what-ifs"", the mourning of ""lost"" time, and even worse: the possibility that where we are is in fact where we belong.This film would not work without Mia Goth's performance, which is truly remarkable. Here, she portrays an outsider anti-hero that is steeped in nuance and conflicting character traits (and flaws). Her ennui and sadness is empathetically played, and one can sense that Goth herself, on some level, identifies with Pearl's pain. She lends the role a potent mixture of naiveté, delicateness, and pure, murderous rage. While Pearl is all of these things, she is also none of them entirely, and thanks to Goth's performance (and the screenplay, which she had a hand in co-crafting with West), the character emerges as multilayered and human despite her propensity for evil. Encircling Goth is a solid supporting cast who are all capable of meeting her intensity with varying degrees of bewilderment, disgust, and sheer terror.""Pearl"" does indeed edge into slasher territory in its third act, and the film as a whole is a visual feast--garishly colorful, and tipping its hat to a number of films. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is an obvious cornerstone, but there are visual and symbolic nods to ""Repulsion"" and, even more heavily, Frederick Friedel's obscure farm-set ""Axe"", another film that follows a mysterious (and murderous) young woman caring for her infirm grandfather on a rural farm. As with ""X"", West uses these influences smartly without browbeating the audience or pushing the film's content over the edge into pure pastiche, and the film downshifts in its denouement in a way that is unexpectedly touching, despite all the spilt blood and entrails.As a companion piece to ""X"", ""Pearl"" may leave some fans of its predecessor underwhelmed, largely because it is so tonally different and not the conventional ""slasher"" film that might be expected. However, as a nuanced character study of a budding serial killer, it could not possibly be any better. ""Pearl"" stands tall as a disturbing and strangely heartbreaking portrait of a person who, upon finding that her search for meaning and validation from others leads her nowhere, is then only capable of destroying them. 9/10.~drownsoda90 rated 9/10 on 16 September 2022"," Very enjoyable.: Pearl is desperate for a better life, a life away from the grind and drudgery of the farm, and to escape her ailing father and disapproving mother, a dancing competition at The Church Hall provides an opportunity.What an unexpected, enjoyable movie this is, a good mix of horror and drama, with a pretty great story mixed in. A repressed girl desperate to escape to a new life, but very much close to the edge.I had all but forgotten about X, and kept thinking there was something strangely familiar about this, of course Pearl is the prequel to that movie, I think on balance I actually preferred this one.Some cracking scenes, Pearl's long monologue after losing out in the dancing competition, and that moment where she chats to her father at the river's edge.A fine performance from Mia Goth, well acted all round.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 5 November 2023"," Pearl might not be a star but Mia Goth certainly is!: Pearl is an absorbing character study of a woman who mentally and emotionally unravels, leading to devastating effects for those closest to her.It is a well crafted story, cleverly peeling back the character of Pearl and providing a great contextualisation to the events of Ti West's X. That being said it totally stands up as a film in its own right for those who haven't seen X.The highlight is the leading performance from Mia Goth. I just can't get over how good she is as Pearl. She is utterly compelling and gives one of the most intriguing and punchy performances I've seen. She is undoubtedly a star and is now one of those actors whose films I will always seek out as I know I'll be getting a magnetic performance. It shouldn't go unmentioned that the supporting cast (limited as they are) are all terrific, but this is Goth's show from start to end.Ti West puts such a distinct and vibrant stamp on this film, he really directs the hell out it. It is visually arresting with a vivid colour palette and a retro, period feel to it all that works so well. Simply put I just loved looking at every second of this film. The music as well is superb. It sets the tone for the whole thing perfectly.Ti West is well on his way to creating not only one of the best horror trilogies of all time, but perhaps one of the greatest trilogies full stop.~ethanbresnett rated 9/10 on 14 March 2023"," Mia Goth's uncut 5 minute monologue is the standout: As a slasher film, Pearl is pretty timid compared to the first film, X. In fact, I would say Pearl as a whole is neither as scary, witty, nor erotic as its original - but what it does is ink out a complete background to Pearl that viewers invested in the world of X will be satisfied with.For me, the absolute highlight of the film was a five minute (or so it felt) monologue by Mia Goth giving the scope of her entire life in a emotional and riveting delivery, all filmed in one uncut scene. Pearl's husband Howard and his returned entry into Pearl's life on the farm did feel a bit rushed, but perhaps not necessary.The film can certainly stand on its own. If you liked Ti West's original in the trilogy, you probably will like Pearl. I know I'll be anxiously awaiting MaXXXine...~Airman87 rated 7/10 on 18 September 2022"," The complexity of insanity: Many who liked ""X"" will probably find themselves disappointed with this prequel, as it never comes close to reaching the levels of shock and intensity that the former reached.In fact, ""Pearl"" isn't really a horror film at all (let alone a slasher), but rather a slow-paced descent-into-madness character study that uses it's brutal violence sparingly. And it's a great character study at that.If you're ok with that, then you're in for a psychological treat.Highest praise must be given to Mia Goth. She co-wrote the screenplay this time around and it's clear she understands the character profoundly. Her performance is terrifying. On a dime, she is able to flip from sweet & innocent to bloodthirsty & vengeful to remorseful and empathetic all within the same scene, sometimes even within the same shot.It is, no hyperbole, one of the best lead performances I have ever seen in the genre.When the protagonist of your story is a murdering psychopath, obviously there is a risk of alienating the audience. But that never happened because the script keeps all of Pearl's actions rooted in the festering grudges she holds toward her unfulfilling responsibilities and the subjectively monotonous life that she feels anchored to.Pearl remains a sympathetic character because she is written as what a lot of us would become if we snapped and acted on every thought we had in our minds.Lastly, the cinematography and other visual choices elevate the journey of madness we are following by adding surreal, otherworldly qualities to Pearl's fantasies that she indulges.The only complaint that I have is that some of the dialogue could have done with a bit more polish. I understand that they were trying to mimic the over-the-top style of older films, but there were times when the spoken words felt cheesy when they should have had more power.I was not expecting it to be as psychologically hard-hitting as it was. And what an emotional gut-punch of an ending that was.It's a great film. Ti West's best work.~benjaminskylerhill rated 9/10 on 16 September 2022"," Better than X - Goth gives an Oscar-worthy turn.: PEARL (2022) *** 1/2 Mia Goth, David Corenswet, Tandi Wright, Matthew Sunderland, Emma Jenkins-Purro, Alistair Sewell. Filmmaker Ti West's prequel to his X is an origin store of the titular farm girl (Goth in an exceptional, Oscar-worthy turn).Set in pandemic stricken 1918 with WWI at its heights the film offers her background strife with the burden of her family and the stars-in-her-eyes promise of a better life only she can see. Echoes of THE WIZARD OF OZ, PSYCHO & CARRIE intermingle yet the screenplay collaborated by West & Goth proves to be cemented in something more than its horror underpinnings. But don't despair - there's enough violence and troubling images to fuel any nightmare. And the gator's back too.~george.schmidt rated 9/10 on 16 September 2022"," There's things to like about this movie and components that dragged and was overdone: Pearl (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a young lady in 1918 who lives on a farm with her handicapped father and over burdened mother and whose husband is off at war. The young lady has delusions of grandeur and feels she should be a movie star and far away from her farm. Her family needs her to stay and help with chores and keep them alive. When there's tryouts for a traveling dance team she plans to audition whether her family wants her to or not.This movie is directed by Ti West (Them) and stars Mia Goth (A Cure for Wellness), David Corenswet (The Politician), Emma Jenkins-Purro (The Brokenwood Mysteries), Matthew Sunderland (The Lost City of Z) and Tandi Wright (Jack the Giant Slayer).The cinematography in this movie is outstanding, as is the attire, depiction of the era and the performance of Mia Goth (who co-wrote and produced this movie with West). This is more of a character piece with horror elements than a traditional horror movie. There's elements that worked for me and scenes that left me scratching my head. I will say I was very frustrated watching this movie. Every scene with the alligator was awesome. There's a pitchfork scene, fight with the mother and explosion I adored. The father was also a solid, creepy character (the bath scenes made me cringe). However, the movie feels like it is trying too hard to prove Pearl is insane. The scarecrow scene felt rediculous and didn't work for me. How people reacted to her behavior at times felt off (they tolerated her uncomfortably long). The monologue scene was great acting but felt unrealistic from the sister in-law's perspective. The ending was sudden and I wanted more.Overall, there's things to like about this movie and components that dragged and was overdone. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 21 September 2022"," Pearl harbours violent thoughts.: 1918 -- Pearl lives on a farm with her mother and incapacitated, wheelchair-bound father; her husband Howard is away in Europe fighting in the war. Pearl longs for a different life, dreaming of fame as a dancer, but such fantasies are unlikely to become reality: she doesn't really have what it takes to be an entertainer, and then there's the fact that she's totally cuckoo.I approach A24 horror films with trepidation: their 'elevated' approach usually means that I'll be bored and irritated by what I see. Ti West's X, however, was a reasonably entertaining movie -- a little slow and underwhelming to begin with but picking up for a very enjoyable second half.Pearl, the prequel to X, is also slow burn, as one might expect from West, and it is very different in tone to his previous movie, but it's also one of A24's better films thanks to a standout performance from Mia Goth, who makes the film's titular character so much more than a one-dimensional movie psycho.Pearl is a complex character, deeply troubled but well aware of the fact that she is somehow different to most people; she desperately wants to fit in, to be loved, to have the perfect life that she sees others enjoying, but it is not to be -- her insanity, anger and violence is barely restrained. Her mother sees what Pearl is capable of and tries to keep her daughter under control, but ultimately even she cannot stop the inevitable from happening.Not exactly a horror film, although horrific and bloody things do happen, Pearl is more of a character study, in which the character in question is a few sandwiches short of a picnic. Goth is extremely impressive, particularly in the scene where she confesses her sins to her soon-to-be-dead sister-in-law Mitsi (Emma Jenkins-Purro). Even if the film isn't to your liking in terms of style, it's hard to deny that its star is anything less than superb, successfully making Pearl both a sympathetic and believably scary person.~BA_Harrison rated 7/10 on 12 November 2022"," Weird hidden gem: The story about a young girl's life descending into madness!Pearl is an ambitious and bold work with art-house horror sensibilities from A24 and Tie West .

She acts with unbridled ""wild abandon"" and is not afraid to declare her self to the word.

This film reminds me of "" Darling""Pearl is a serious, deliriously messed-up psychodrama with an amazing musical score, period piece accurate 1917 wardrobe and vintage early cars Terrific cinematography and disturbing imagery . A heavily Stylized slasher with some suburb kills that yield some tantalizing gory effects. This film won me over as it starts off as a very slow burn ! As the character study progresses and also the performance of Pearls overbearing mother played by talented Tandi Wright ;I found the merit of the film sneaks up on you ! It is terrifically accomplished and horribly gripping . 8.5/10Note: You must stay a watch the closing credits . It is excellent mind-f % $ k .The strained smile that Goth holds for more than three minutes behind the closing credits was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration from Ti West. He had planned to film her smiling and then choose a freeze-frame of the most unsettling shot, but at the last minute suggested ""What if you hold a smile as long as you possibly can and let's see what happens?"" They shot the smile, which ""goes from comical to haunting to deeply disturbing the longer it continues,"" in one take.~robfollower rated 8/10 on 28 September 2022"," Mia Goth's performance is one for the ages: Extremely entertaining throwback-appearing (think old Hollywood cinematography and score) blood-soaked origin story of a girl with big dreams. After hints of malevolence, a chain of circumstances and events leads Pearl down a dark path.The key here is Mia Goth's performance. One minute she comes across as a sympathetic character, the next she is beyond creepy, and there are still times in this film with laughter interspersed between moments of horrific violence. Perhaps the best moment in the film is a monologue that is best described as otherworldly. Really good watch, tremendous performance.~robodoc-20897 rated 8/10 on 16 September 2022"

When they find the body of the girl in a park, Lt. Fuller asks to bug the telephone of the sisters. Meanwhile the prowler has killed Mrs. Mac and is stalking the three sisters.""Black Christmas"" is a simple but very dark and suspenseful horror movie. The deranged serial-killer is never seen and the slightly ambiguous conclusion clearly indicates that Peter had nothing to do with the murders or calls, and the incompetent police officers do not find the bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac. In 1979, the idea of a psychopathic killer calling from the inside of the house was brilliantly used in the creepy ""When a Stranger Calls"". The future Superman's girlfriend Margot Kidder is very beautiful but her character is completely fool. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Noite do Terror"" (""Night of the Terror"")Note: On 03 July 2020, I saw this film again.~claudio_carvalho rated 7/10 on 19 November 2009"," The original and perhaps the best slasher film ever made.: The girls of a sorority house are being tormented by a twisted prank caller who continually calls to convey increasingly vile and abusive sentiments. What at first appears to be a sick joke eventually turns violent for the girls during the season of supposed goodwill and merriment.The original and maybe even the best, Black Christmas' set the ball rolling for the slasher genre and was the biggest influence for the phenomenally successful John Carpenter classic, Halloween' (1978), which was, in fact, originally conceived as a sequel. Although Italian director, Mario Bava, had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie, Bay of Blood' (1971), it was Black Christmas' that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative sub-genres of horror cinema. Bob Clark (who previously made the kooky, enjoyable, low-budget zombie film Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' (1972)), still at this point something of an amateur director, took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nerve-wracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as The Haunting' (1963) and Alien' (1979) are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by Black Christmas'.The simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely, comic-book style events; the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudo-claustrophobic environment of the sorority house, from where the vast majority of events occur, offers the perfect, vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented; even at the very end, very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity, Black Christmas' has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways, the concealing of several key points puts the viewer's knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.Black Christmas' is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget, this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as Halloween', Friday the 13th' (1980), Slumber Party Massacre (1982) and The House on Sorority Row' (1983) should be able to spot several of the now-clichés that first materialized in Black Christmas'. My rating for Black Christmas' - 8½/10.~Snake-666 rated 8/10 on 28 July 2004"," ""If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl... then it's on too tight!"": Released and ignored in 1973, ""Black Christmas"" became a forgotten classic. The Canadian shocker was eventually re-released as ""Silent Night, Evil Sight"" in order to avoid confusion with the blaxploitation films of the time, but it bombed once again. In the early 80s, it was broadcast on cable as ""Stranger in the House"" in order to snatch up some rantings. Right when the movie seemed dead, NBC decided to cancel a prime-time airing of it because it was deemed ""too scary"" for network television. This was all film-buffs needed to go back and discover the wonderful ""cool movie that you never heard of"" that is ""Black Christmas"".Before I go on, here it goes: ""Black Christmas"" is one of the scariest (and finest) horror films ever made. Major credit must go to director Bob Clark (who went on to direct the epic ""Citizen Kane"" remake and because of legal reasons had to change it's title to ""Porky's"") who like John Carpenter in ""Halloween"", is able to create a current and simplistic creepy atmosphere. ""Black Christmas"" is indeed very similar to ""Halloween"": Both movies are themed with a particular time of year, both movies feature a killer with breathing problems who loves POV shots, and both movies have a long and slow build-up that makes the audience care for the characters that are about to get slashed. The difference is that ""Black Christmas"" does it much better, in fact, I think it is a superior film.The movie begins with a shaky POV shot of a stranger who decides to sneak inside a sorority house in order to get some fresh meat. That's it! Plain and simple. There is no ""your father killed my cousin's cat"" motive, the killer wants to kill because he simply wants to. Isn't it much scarier like that? No motive at all?The cast is not your usual teen slasher stereotypes: There is the not-so-virginal sweet leading lady Jess (Olivia Hussey) who is having trouble because she wants to have an abortion. Her boyfriend Peter (Keir Duella) eventually disagrees. In the sorority house there are many other odd characters, including chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking Barb (ironically played by Margot Kidder) who steals the show with the much-needed humor. Unlike the countless other slashers out there, ""Black Christmas"" takes time for the audience to get used to these characters and actually care for them. Unlike in ""Halloween"", the entire top-notch cast in ""Black Christmas"" give excellent performances. Olivia Hussey is perfect as not-so-innocent Jess, Keir Duella is scary and misleading as her deranged boyfriend. And of course, Margot Kidder steals the show with an excellent and amusing take playing herself. Also noticeable is cult star John Saxon as Lt. Fuller who many years later started showing his personal love for ""Black Christmas"" on interviews.The well-balanced doses of drama and comedy connects the audience to the characters on screen so strongly that they sometimes we forget it is a horror movie. And when something scary eventually happens, it comes as a total shock. Bob Clark eventually became famous for his comedies, and you can sense his upbeat sense of humor though the entire film. Recent movie audiences lost their patience, so movies like that can't be made anymore. And there is a good reason ""Black Christmas"" is currently labeled as a comedy at the IMDb, it is really funny. So many memorable quotes here: ""These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to top of it!"" or ""I'm a drunk? Here we have the queen of vodka herself!"" and of course, the whole Fellatio address.But isn't this a horror film? It really lives up to it's tagline. To begin with, the killer is not a silent invincible maniac on a Santa Claus costume. Instead, he is never seen. Most of his moments come from POV shots and dark takes. He is confined to the sorority house's attic for most of the time. How is that scary? Sound comes to play. The killer calls the sorority girls though the phone many times (early shades of ""Scream"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"") and uses some of the most disturbing voices you will ever hear. He imitates pigs squeaking, perverted dirty talk, animal noises, screaming, heavy breathing, and many other weird sounds. Does it work? Of course. This guy makes Norman Bates look like Richard Simmons.These disturbing elements are all put together though the brilliant cinematography by Reg Morris, who is able to capture the silent Christmas atmosphere perfectly with the wonderful use of silent snow-covered streets and decoration. Let's face it, Christmas is a bit creepy, isn't it? It certainly will be after watching this flick. The piano score by Carl Zittrer is simplistic and effective as well. The repetitive use of Christmas carols also add up to the tension.Ignored over the years and unknown outside the cult horror fans, this is an underrated classic that deserves much more attention that it ever got. Everything is perfect in this Canadian chiller: The atmosphere, the music, the overall spooky look, and one of the scariest villains in history. No gore (although the killings are so disturbingly shot they don't really need any) no sex, no nudity, just plain old-fashioned horror. This is ""Black Christmas"": Snow-covered silent streets, creepy Christmas carols, spooky use of lightening and color, scary atmosphere and the overall look of the plastic bag suffocated victim in a rocking chair staring from the attic window. Trust me, you will never go to your attic the same way again.""Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a creature was staring...""~fdpedro rated 10/10 on 3 November 2003"," Hugely influential slasher/horror is nearly a match for Halloween: A classic exercise in subtlety, this film prefers to leave the horror to the imagination rather than splattering it graphically across our screens. And it benefits as a result of this. In fact, the film has the (dubious) distinction of being the first 'proper' slasher film, influencing many others that were to come later, including the classic HALLOWEEN.The director, Bob Clark, was no stranger to horror films, having directed CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. With Black Christmas, he popularised many of the clichés we are used to seeing in horror films today, such as the obscene telephone calls. Of course, when this film was made these ideas were still fresh, and not clichés at all. There's also the POV shot from the killer in the opening scene, which was used again to great success in HALLOWEEN. Due to the success of the latter, this film remains neglected in the annals of horror, and is not credited with the creation of the numerous clichés which slasher horrors of the 1980s contained.One big advantage this film has over the many other slasher films around is the realism and atmosphere. For instance, the characters in the film are totally realistic, and all have traits which make them interesting. Margot Kidder is fine as the foul-mouthed alcoholic and Olivia Hussey is excellent as the main heroine. Obviously parallels are to be drawn between her character and Jamie Lee Curtis' character in HALLOWEEN, but I would go so far to say that Hussey creates a more believable person in this film, someone to really empathise with. John Saxon is on hand once again to play a policeman (what else?) and personally I find him totally capable in the role as well - he offers a hard, but kind presence, someone who you can turn to for help, which is exactly what a policeman should be.There's also a little bit of comedy, revolving around a slow policeman at the station. The killer's manic telephone calls are totally disturbing and offer a contrast to the silent menace of Michael Myers. This killer is insane! With lots of atmospheric scenes and an unsettling ending guaranteed to stay with you long after the film has finished playing, this is really one of the best slasher films there is, a film strong enough on chills to cope without the welter of blood and gore and inventive deaths we are used to seeing.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 4 December 2015"," Damn this was effective!: Think of the most compelling and interesting modern slasher you've ever seen, and then imagine if it was filmed in 74'. That's what this is. I was put off by the fact that this movie looks and sounds dated by today's standards, just like all movies from that era. For me, that's usually a deal breaker. But goddamn this movie truly is tasteful and classy horror, with well acted characters that make smart decisions and say smart things that a real person would do and say, and a truly terrifying psycho killer! This movie absolutely puts to shame all ""slashers"" that have come after it. Seeing a brooding atmosphere set up like this really makes me understand just how much my standards have been lowered by the current offering of horror movies out there. I've just gotten used to the mediocre and accepted it as normal, but Black Christmas is true home invasion horror, like I've never imagined. And this might be the creepiest psycho killer I've ever seen.I could see how this generation might be put off with the slowness of some of the movie. From my perspective, it wasn't slowness, it was absolutely necessary scenes to properly build an atmosphere where the actual terrifying scenes are extra terrifying, but that's getting rarer and rarer to see in modern films.What a movie.~jamespurcell-17815 rated 7/10 on 23 November 2022"," As Chilling And Somber As A Cold Winter's Night.: I watched this film during the holiday season a few years back, and have come to the conclusion that ""Black Christmas"" is a neglected classic, and (in my opinion) is the first and best slasher film ever made. Guaranteed, fans of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" will love this film, some may find they love it even more than ""Halloween"". And even though I thought I'd never say that, after viewing ""Black Christmas"" a few times, I found myself enjoying it much more.""Black Christmas"" starts off with a Christmas party at a sorority house. While the festivities are taking place, a stranger is breaking into the attic upstairs, while the unknowing sorority sisters are enjoying themselves. The phone rings, and we are introduced to Jessica (Olivia Hussey), our main character. A strange person on the phone makes obscene comments, speaking in different voices while the sorority sisters listen in disgust. As the sisters flood out, all leaving to visit family and friends and whatnot, only a few are left at the sorority house, among them are - Jessica, Barb (Margot Kidder), and Phyl (Andrea Martin). Clare (Lynne Griffin), a fellow sorority sister, has gone missing, and Clare's father comes to investigate along with the help of law enforcement and her friends. The strange phone calls continue, and get more and more disturbing as time goes by, until Jessica is forced to call the police. Could it be her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), playing some sort of sick joke? Or is someone watching the helpless girls from within the house? As the holiday nears, the psychotic killer sets in motion his bloody agenda, while the local police try and track him down before more murders are committed.Before Bob Clark went on to direct the family holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"", he took a darker look at the holiday season with this hidden gem. ""Black Christmas"" is a masterpiece horror film, and surprisingly predates the classics by many years, such as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"", which get most of the credit for ""creating"" the slasher genre, when in fact this little Canadian chiller started it all. The plot was very original at the time, and contains some very scary moments - the scenes in the attic with the killer are among the scariest and strangest scenes I've ever watched, and the phone calls are flat out bizarre. The movie reeks a very dark, foreboding atmosphere (despite it taking place during the holidays) that never lets up throughout the film's entirety, as it slowly builds suspense before reaching the climax. It takes place during Christmastime, which honestly doesn't matter to the plot (it could've taken place at any time of the year), but the fact that it's set during such a joyous, festive season gives it a little more of a sinister quality, and makes it a perfect holiday horror movie.The acting in this film was excellent. Olivia Hussey is our lead, and she plays her character with vulnerability and innocence, putting the audience on her side the whole way. Margot Kidder plays the loudmouth, drunk sorority girl, and is also excellent in her performance, being a boisterous yet a likable character at the same time. Her character is probably the most memorable of the bunch. Andrea Martin plays Phyl, the quiet but friendly girl, and is also very good in her role. And Keir Dullea plays Jess's suspicious boyfriend well - the audience isn't sure if they should consider him a suspect or not, and he plays that perfectly. The rest of the cast includes numerous Canadian performers, all whom turn in convincing performances. There is even a little comedy thrown into the mix, an example being the alcoholic sorority housemother, Mrs. Mac., and her witty one-liners. The humor is subtle and is easily overlooked by the movie's grim demeanor, but it's in there for sure. The movie also contains some very creative death scenes (especially Barb's glass unicorn death, and the plastic attack in the closet), but even though these are present, it's really not a gory film, we mostly see the aftermath. The deaths aren't very bloody, tending to rely much more on sound, which is equally effective. One of the major things I admire about this movie is that the audience never knows who the killer is - he's kept a mystery, even at the shocking conclusion - the audience ever really gets a resolution and we aren't given any answers, something that I find to be very effective. I like the fact that we are given so little information on the villain, because it makes his presence much more terrifying. The tricky camera-work prevents us from ever seeing his face, in fact all we really see is his body shape, hair style, and his hands. We hear his voice though, as he harasses the sorority girls over the phone, muttering vulgar and disturbing phrases and making death threats (which were very well done, I might add). Even scarier, is the fact that he's hiding in the attic the entire time. This movie completely shatters the idea of feeling safe in your home... you can lock your doors and windows, but what if the killer is already inside the house, and you just don't know about it? Very scary concept. To sum things up, ""Black Christmas"" is an overlooked classic that deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten over the years - I'm sure any horror fan would love to find it in their stocking. Hopefully the upcoming remake will gain the original film some long-deserved attention. ""Black Christmas"" is the ultimate holiday-horror film for fans of the genre, and is the best slasher movie ever as far as I'm concerned. An underrated masterpiece. 10/10.~drownsoda90 rated 10/10 on 20 December 2006"," Amazing: It's not often that you find a film in the thriller/horror genre that has something ""new"" to say, so it's even more exciting to find that one of the original films in the ""slasher"" genre is actually still one of the freshest, most unique and utterly entertaining of them all. This is the kind of movie you can't wait to tell your friends about, knowing full well they've probably never seen it, but they've heard of it.Everything about this film is stellar. The acting, to steal the words of a great reviewer who loves this movie, is flawless. The direction is confident and assured. What is Bob Clark's story? How did he go from making quirky, ground-breaking horror to...well...""Baby Geniuses 2?"" His black-humored wit is on display in all his movies, and here too. Margot Kidder and Marian Waldman shine as foul-mouthed alcohol abusers. Particularly Kidder--it's hard to believe she did this at the BEGINNING of her career, she's that assured...and fun to watch. Olivia Hussey is alluring as the lead, Jessica, and her beauty, as well as her speaking voice are a welcome presence.The plot might seem clichéd now, until you understand that it was all the movies that came AFTER that were the clichés--even ""He Knows Your Alone,"" which seemed so vital at the time, can't compare. ""Black Christmas"" is a FILM, and goes beyond the conventions of a cheap slasher. The key is the ending--only a director with an artistic sensibility would have fought for it (no spoilers here). Suffice to say, in all the slashers I've watched I've never seen the equal. It's a tricky business to sum up a mystery in a plot, and few can maintain the element of surprise, intelligence or creativity required. You will NOT see the ending coming here, and though the end is a surprise, it works well.If you're like I was and hesitating to watch this because you think it'll just be ""another fear film,"" don't waste anymore time! You will NOT be sorry you spent your Christmas ""black...""~TonyDood rated NA on 26 September 2005"," Priceless: I am not into horror films but I loved this. It is a laugh riot.

Instead of having ""Dracula"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Mummy"" we had ""Michael Myers"" ""Jason Voorhees"" and ""Freddy Kruger"". Well a few years before those movie villains hit the screen there was another killer who packed a powerful punch his name was Billy and he was terrifying in the 1974 film ""Black Christmas"". To me he is the scariest man in movie history.This 1974 film is not well known. It is however 10x better than most other horror movies pf the 1970's and 1980's! This film has many things that seemed to of inspired ""Halloween"". The opening shots and set up were almost identical to ""Halloween"" which was released 4 years later. In this film As winter break begins, a group of sorority sisters, including Jess (Olivia Hussey) and the often inebriated Barb (Margot Kidder), begin to receive anonymous, lascivious phone calls. Initially, Barb eggs the caller on, but stops when he responds threateningly. Soon, Barb's friend Claire (Lynne Griffin) goes missing from the sorority house, and a local adolescent girl is murdered, leading the girls to suspect a serial killer is on the loose. But no one realizes just how near the culprit is.This film developed a cult following and was later remade. The original however is still an edge of your seat thriller!
