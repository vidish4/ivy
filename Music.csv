Maestro (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Carey Mulligan|Bradley Cooper|Matt Bomer|Vincenzo Amato|Greg Hildreth|Michael Urie|Brian Klugman|Nick Blaemire|Mallory Portnoy|Alexandra Santini|Jarrod LaBine|Sarah Silverman|Kate Eastman|William Hill|Valéry Lessard|Renée Stork|Tim Rogan|Sara Sanderson,Bradley Cooper,Bradley Cooper|Josh Singer,This love story chronicles the lifelong relationship of conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.," Beautiful to look at, gorgeous music, but no story.: I went to Maestro expecting a film that would chronicle the life of one of America's, if not the world's, great composer/conductors. I've seen Leonard Bernstein many, many times, starting at age 8 when my grandfather took me to Bernstein's music for kids on Saturday mornings at Lincoln Center. I had no idea who he was at the time, only that people called him Lenny. My grandpa took me to meet him and he was spellbinding. I remember him looking right threw me with his expressive eyes.He loved kids and loved to teach them about music. Turns out grandpa and Lenny went to Harvard together, hence I got a personal introduction. Bernstein is the guy that got me hooked on classical music and music in general, but I didn't learn anything about his musical career, his childhood, his years at Harvard, his work in Europe, who inspired him, etc.The making of West Side Story is really interesting (if you know the story) but nothing about it in this film and I mean ""nothing.; We get a tiny glimpse of Candide, but nothing about its composition or insight into the Maestro's process. We get zero insight into his Missa Brevis, perhaps on the highlights of his career.Bradley Cooper blew me away. I've seen Lenny up close many times and I've talked to him a few times. Cooper nailed it, and the scene at St John of the Divine is probably one of the greatest musical scenes ever captured on film. Cooper's conducting is simply amazing. He worked very very hard to capture the speech, mannerisms, and the Bernstein attitude and texture toward music. I cannot speak highly enough of Cooper's performance, but we get so little insight into the musician, and that was so disappointing.Carey Mulligan? Her performance is nothing less than spectacular, in fact all the acting is extraordinary, but it's not a story. The Bernstein children really have nothing to do in this film, and I have no idea why Lenny's sister was included as she has very little to say or do. Overall, a very perplexing film ... not sure what he was going for. In fact, I kept waiting for it to start. The emphasis was all on style, and believe me, it's beautiful to look at.~rich-fouts rated 6/10 on 14 December 2023"," Showcases Everything Least Interesting About Bernstein's Life: When Amy Schumer was roasting the film ""Being the Ricardos"" at the Oscars a couple of years ago, she was making fun of Aaron Sorkin for writing a screenplay about the most iconic female comedian of all time that didn't have a single funny moment. She compared it to making a biopic about Michael Jordan and only showing the bus trips between games.Bradley Cooper, pay attention. Why did you choose to make a movie about Leonard Bernstein, arguably one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century, and then focus on all of the most mundane aspects of his life? Do we need yet another movie about a famous person bogged down with scene after scene of them squabbling with their spouse? If you don't already know why Bernstein is so legendary, you're not going to learn it here. You might not even come away from the movie knowing what Bernstein wrote, because the film tosses out titles quickly and casually as it's rushing to get to the next scene of Cooper overacting and Carey Mulligan looking strained as all long-suffering wives in all biopics ever made must do. You don't see him developing any projects or working with collaborators. The movie implies that he was disdainful of his success in musical theater despite revolutionizing it with ""West Side Story."" But then why did he spend so much time working in it if he hated it? Why weren't we at least treated with someone doing a cameo appearance as Stephen Sondheim? Why why why?And then to top it all off, the last quarter of the film is a dreary slog as we watch Mulligan slowly die of cancer. I despise it when movies show characters slowly dying of cancer. It freaks me out, and I hate it. I know this woman actually did die of cancer, but I don't want to watch it. That's more my problem than it is the movie's, because that's what happened, but still.Cooper's screenplay is terrible, and because of that, nothing else about the movie has a chance. Mulligan is quite good, but she's hampered by the material. Cooper will be nominated for an Oscar, and might win, because the Academy loves nothing more than rewarding actors for playing famous people while heaped under prosthetic makeup. To the film's credit, for once the makeup is quite good. Usually biopic makeup makes the actors look like their faces are about to melt off, but here the effect is pretty seamless.Someone clearly told Bradley Cooper that Warren Beatty is the only person to ever score Oscar nominations for producing, directing, writing, and acting in the same film, and Cooper said ""Hold my beer."" He's so desperately hankering for an Oscar for this film that you can smell red carpet wafting from the screen.Grade: C-~evanston_dad rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Mesmirising portrait, but not in the way I had expected...: Beware, this is a movie about Bernstein's marriage, NOT about his music. It should have better been titled as ""The Marriage of Leonard & Felicia"" and not ""Maestro"".I expected a music biopic, but what I got was a masterfully directed and terrifically acted portrait of a marriage with a bisexual husband and all the difficulties (secret affairs with gay men) that came along with it, when back in the days of the fifties and sixties, being gay wasnt something one could openly talk about in public.The good: LONG scenes with NO editing cuts. What BLISS to be able to watch these 2 great actors perform uninhibited by cuts, with many minutes long lasting scenes filmed from 1 static angle. I truly applaud the director (Bradley Cooper) and the photographer and editor for this gorgeous and balanced way of filming this portrait. I was really impressed!Any bad? I had my trepidations about Bradley Cooper's impersonation of Bernstein that was borderline according to many. Did he pull it off? I think he did a really good job, although it took me some time to get used to all the mannerisims (the peculiar voice in particular). I can understand though that others might get a bit uneasy / irritated by some of the makeup (too much?) and other mannerisims.Carey Mulligan (as the wife of Bernstein) deserves special mention. Her role was more subdued and subtle, but AS powerful and touching. She truly shined!Conclusion: I am not a fan of watching stories about artist's private lives, but as far as this personal account of Leonard Bernstein's marriage is concerned, they created a really mesmirising, warmhearted portrait, that left me behind in my seat with goosebumps and in reverence...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb!~imseeg rated 8/10 on 26 November 2023"," Admired it more than I liked it: POSITIVES:1) The two central performances are both absolutely sensational. Both Cooper and Mulligan have some really jaw dropping scenes and they were what kept me engaged throughout2) The direction and cinematography are both superb. There are lots of long takes and clever camerawork and this helped to make certain scenes feel much more impactful, such as the big conducting scene near the end that goes on for several minutes with only a couple of cuts3) Using Bernstein's own pieces as the score for the film was very clever and I loved how over dramatic the score felt a lot of the timeNEGATIVES:1) I really didn't like the first hour or so of this film while it was in black and white. It just felt so pretentious, fake and full of itself. Also, the characters all talk insanely fast for some reason during the black and white scenes. Things did improve once things went to colour though2) As the title of this review states, I felt like the film was more of a technical achievement than something I actually enjoyed watching. I didn't really care about any of the characters, in fact I found Bernstein very unlikeable, and I wasn't really invested in the plot3) As is the case with a lot of biopics, I think this film is guilty of trying to cram an entire person's life into only 2 hours, which makes a lot of things feel very rushed.~DanLawson146 rated 7/10 on 7 December 2023"," Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance: It's a biopic set in New York City between 1943 and the late 1980s. Its primary focus is the relationship and marriage between Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). We learn pretty early that Bernstein's sexual appetites extend to both women and men. An early male relationship is with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). Felicia knows Bernstein's orientation from the beginning but asks that he be discrete. We also meet Bernstein's sister, Shirley (Sarah Silverman), and, especially, he and Felicia's oldest daughter, Jamie (Maya Hawke).The second orientation of ""Maestro"" is Bernstein's difficulty harnessing his expansive skills in composition, conducting, and popular education about music. His extroversion sometimes hinders his ability to focus. The film portrays this issue less effectively.""Maestro"" is an intense and skillfully photographed movie. The cinematography reflects the era being portrayed. Thus, for example, the film is black and white until the 1960s. I cannot comment on the portrayals of Bernstein's conducting or the quality of his compositions, except to note that Bernstein's conducting is very intense. An enormous number of people populate the film, making it difficult to keep track from time to time. That said, Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance that deserves Academy consideration, though some parts of her life are missing, such as her political activism.Cooper's Bernstein is not deep outside the relationship with Felicia that slowly deteriorates. The film omits to mention that Bernstein also had affairs with women during the marriage. The movie portrays Felicia's final illness with breast cancer very effectively and emotionally..~steiner-sam rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," I've watched too many of this kind of story, and 'Maestro' isn't an inch different.: A struggling musician agonized by his own genius, talents, and creativity and trapped in loveless marriage filled with guilt. Both look the other way while one has an affair and realize the importance of one's own partner too late. Right now, at the top of my head I can think of 'Fosse/Verdon', 'A Star Is Born', 'George & Tammy', 'Walk the Line', 'Dreamgirls', 'Daisy Jones & The Six', and etc. (Wow, that's a lot.) Biographical genre is especially tricky because it has to excel the life of actual historical figures. 'Maestro' could have been so much better if it delved into the introspective and artistic side of Bernstein deeper or provided a different and fresh point of view on his life rather than reciting his personal life. His autobiography or research would be more fun and interesting than this explanatory movie.There were a few futile attempts to make the movie look more artistic, abstract, and ambiguous. They failed because they serve no purpose but to look pretentious. White and black, camera movement, the use of light and shadows, and musical aspects. They are all good attempts, but for what? By doing so, is the story getting stronger? Do they enhance what viewers feel? Waste of time and films.Bradley Cooper's performance is disappointing. He never acts; he imitates. When he's on the screen, we know clearly that he's acting. It's hard to be absorbed and immersed into the screen because he always pushes the audience away with his trying too hard. I get that he wants to emulate Bernstein's twangy voice. However, emotions and messages he delivers are more important than his likeness of Bernstein's tone, accent, sound, or mannerism. He focuses on what's outside of Bernstein rather than what would be inside of him. There is a 10 minute sequence of Cooper conducting, and it's screaming 'Look how good I am!!!'. It's one of the highest points for emotions to burst out for the audience, and I started to laugh.~TaylorYee94 rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," The filmmaking was very good, but I found the story not that interesting.: We don't know much about Leonard Bernstein. We didn't learn why he wanted to be a composer or how he got in the business. His relationship wasn't very clear either. He's bisexual, but that doesn't go anywhere. His wife isn't explained much either other than being a stage actress. We don't know much about his children. The timelines aren't clear when the movie takes place. It seems to start in the 50s other than the opening scene of him as an old man. I do like Bradley Cooper's performance, but not much comes from the character. We don't know what made him famous since he was already famous before his memorable score in On the Waterfront.~MJB784 rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," Where's the biography?: Yes, good acting, great music but absolutely no story. At all. Apart from his bisexuality which dominated the script.Bradley Cooper was too greedy in writing, directing and starring. What did he write? Not much of a story. I'd like to have seen Lenny's childhood explicated, more meat on the bare bones offered here.Also, why so little on West Side Story - one brief extract and not the huge explosive hit it was at the time. The adulation which followed.The teasing bits of his Missa were beautiful and far too much of his Mahler, though lovely, had little bearing on the overall story.Brad's prosthetic nose was distracting in that it gave a nasal whiny tone to his dialogue. And he might have done better with another actor.Carey Mulligan, as always was amazing in her role but again, underplayed the distress she must have felt at his infidelity/. At one point he left her for a young (male) lover and only returned when she was diagnosed with cancer. (in her breast, from a broken heart? Who knows)The great man of music was not served well here, far too shallow a treatment of his genius.5/10.~wisewebwoman rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," How is it possbile to make Leonard Bernstein uninteresting?: The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper's transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn't a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife's dealing with her husband's bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein's conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn't much left!~fmdead rated 6/10 on 24 December 2023", Too much about his marriage: Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception. Bradley should just have acted and not tried to direct and write the screenplay.~phd_travel rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023

When Floyd is kidnapped, Branch and Poppy embark on a journey to reunite his two other brothers and rescue Floyd."," Great fun if you let it: A cinema full of children (and parents who had to accompany their children *g*). Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film. There will probably be few judgments in between. But children will be thrilled.~MarcusCyron rated 8/10 on 15 October 2023"," Loved It!: I personally really enjoyed the movie the whole way through. It's truly amazing to watch these characters grow and develop, the soundtrack is catchy, the cast is incredible, the voice acting, too!The movie captures Branch's trauma in a special way and I really love that. They manage to make it real but in a kid-friendly way.I've been a fan of the franchise since the first movie, so getting to see how these characters became who they are and getting to see their backstories was really satisfying.Branch and Poppy's relationship really stuck out to me. I love how Poppy dealt with Branch's feelings and made sure he knew his feelings were valid.Very very well done dreamworks threequel and I can't wait to see where they take this franchise next.10/10.~evangelinebone rated 10/10 on 7 November 2023"," New Characters, Old Friends: Well as a 49-year old woman(giving out my age lol!!), who is a kid at heart with these movies here. Still you have to really love the Trolls.Expect references to boy bands and in jokes from that. With Branch and Poppy as the latter realizes he used to be as a toddler but his three other brothers due to the oldest one being bossy went their separate ways.Forced to be reunited over in next to the youngest, Floyd is kidnapped by the brother-sister antagonists that wanted their own sound but stole from Floyd's.In getting the two other brothers, one married with so many kids, another into yoga, and the other the older brother who bossed everybody around in trying to unite the band to free Floyd.Poppy who thought she was an only child to her king father, realizes she may have a sibling as well. Who looks like her.New characters and old friends. Great for the holiday crowd in kids films.~shelbythuylinh rated 8/10 on 17 November 2023"," Adorable, witty characters with original true to life dialogues and funky soundscore. Definitely suited for grownups as well. Not kiddin': Accidentally stumbled into this movie and what a joy it was. Why did I have such a good time as an adult? Because the (terrific) dialogues are tailormade to grownups first. I am not kiddin'More good: the trolls look absolutely adorable and kids will love the happy go lucky spirit and vivid colors and fastpaced animation. This movie is a sure bet for a fun family time.Such a relief to see an animation movie that is targetted at kids, but which can be be enjoyed by old folks as well. I applaud the writers firstmost for this achievement. The dialogues arent difficult or anything, but there are tons of subtle jokes packaged inside this story, that only grownups will understand.Definitely recommended for young AND old if you are into 90 minutes of charming and witty entertainment.~imseeg rated 8/10 on 24 October 2023"," Delivers A Lot Of Heart, Along With Showing The Importance Of Family Values, Friendship, And Love: I love the new animated musical, Trolls Band Together. The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. Trolls Band Together had me out of my seat, dancing and singing along to all the songs.In the film, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple. As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boy band ""BroZone,"" with his four brothers. BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch has not seen his brothers since. When Branch's bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of pop-star villains, Velvet (Amy Schumer) and Veneer (Andrew Rannells), Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity.Trolls Band Together embraces the boy band era with so many references to everyone's favorite bands. The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. The entire movie is filled with humor, catchy cover songs, amazing animation, and lessons about family. Directed by Walt Dohm and Tim Heitz, the animation in this DreamWorks production is stunning -- all the vibrant colors throughout the movie are amazing. I was not able to take your eyes off the screen. All the music goes so well with the storyline in every scene. It features a new original song, ""Better Place,"" from Justin Timberlake's old boy band NSYNC. It was so fun to sing and dance along. The voice actors are terrific. Timberlake and Kendrick are joined by Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Icona Pop, Anderson Paak, Ron Funches, Kenan Thompson, Kunal Nayyar plus a handful of newcomers. They could not have picked a better group of actors to voice these characters. The script by Elizabeth Tippet is so smart, but my favorite part is all the songs and dances throughout the movie. Trolls movies have been a hit with viewers of all ages and this one is no different. I predict that everyone will be singing and dancing and loving every minute of this movie.The film's message is about family dynamics and how all family relationships are different. It shows viewers that no two families are the same and all families have their differences with each other, but they are still family. Be aware that it contains some rude and suggestive humor and some scary creatures like the Bergens and large spiders, plus the trolls are chased and eaten.I give Trolls Band Together 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults. You can watch Trolls Band Together in theaters on November 17, 2023.

I love the different artstyles, locations and characters! There're not just giants and trolls but more to that like human giants etc : mountain Ragenous people and the people in the 'Wish you were here!' Island. The artstyle changes when they tried to hustle and the animation is smooth like butter. I love the songs a lot, especially different time with different songs, it really adds up to the atmosphere. There were times where I felt chills like the first scene of mountain ragenous. I also love the chemistry Poppy and Branch has, its lovely how they depend and listen to each other, love how Veener also has a change of heart and decided to be honest about it. Overall, it's definitely a hundred for me, recommended!!! Maybe not for little kids? Just skip the scenes where tiny 'curses' into the black box. I didnt really pay attention to the bad stuff (if there were any in the first place). I just vibe, chill with the movie, characters and the songs.

Of the songs that I really liked, I want to mention «Perfect», «Mount Rageous», as well as «Better Place».Also, I was pleased to hear the song «Sweet Dreams».Overall, «Trolls Band Together» - is a great, fun, 92-minute adventure that I'll happily repeat when it comes out in good quality.I think that the digital release will take place in mid-December or early January, because the cartoon will be released in US theaters only on November 17th.My rating is 9 out of 10 and I recommend watching this cartoon, and especially going and watching it in the cinema with the whole family.~anonim-73883 rated 9/10 on 25 October 2023"," Tons of cute visual humor.: IN A NUTSHELL:I think this is a cute franchise, so I was excited to see what they would do with this new sequel.

It also showcases a few different styles of animation design. It's so great at making you feel the felt and other fabric textures with your eyes.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:The movie assumes you have seen the previous Trolls movies and know these characters' stories and relationships. If you haven't seen the first two films, you'll miss some of the character development.If you enjoy this Trolls franchise, this sequel will be a welcome addition. If you don't, you should probably skip this movie altogether because it's a lot more of the same.We have to wait 37 minutes for a full musical number. After that, the music is almost non-stop.TIPS FOR PARENTS:Parents will appreciate the music, clever jokes, and well-presented values.A character asks someone if she's a ""Narc"". Kids probably won't know what that means.Because the movie was designed for kids, there are a lot of scenes that feature underwear.To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!~trinaboice rated 8/10 on 31 October 2023"

Then Priscilla, leaves her life behind to be part of Elvis's life and live it the way he wants her to.

The film documents their life together till their divorce.Having watched Elvis the movie and totally enjoying it to the core, it was hard to buy into this Bad Elvis. Thanks to the performances especially by Cailee Spaeny, I was able to stay with the narrative till the end. This had a serious narrative and it wasn't an easy watch. As it only documents the years from the moment Priscilla meets Elvis and them living together, only to end up in a marriage which parts them enough to give Priscilla enough courage to seek divorce.Once again it was a powerful performance by Cailee and kudos to Sofia Coppola to get such a performance from her and to have that control over the narrative, which successfully portrays the emotional journey of Priscilla. From being a naive teen who is hopelessly in love, despite being ill treated to finally grow up enough to figure out what needs to be done.

Coppola (who wrote the screenplay adapted from Priscilla's book) makes a case that Elvis (Jacob Elordi) viewed his then future wife as a type of possession. When the teenager asks for permission to take a part-time job, the musician forbades it saying that he needs her to be available whenever he desires. Like the dog, Priscilla is always to be primped and pampered to its owner's specifications.One could say that PRISCILLA represents the other side of Baz Luhrman's recent phantasmagorical film ELVIS in both style and POV. That's certainly true in many ways, but it's doubtful that Coppola would have made her movie much differently even if Luhrman's film didn't exist. Phillipe La Sourd's cinematography, Tamara Deverell's Production Design and Stacey Battat's costuming all fit nicely within Coppola's aesthetic. The filmmaker's love of pop music is also fully on display with period songs mixed freely with more recent tunes in a similar vein (the movie begins with The Ramones and fades out with Dolly Parton).Coppola has rarely been an auteur interested in pure plot and narrative drive. She prefers to soak the viewer into the milieu of her characters. On that level, PRISCILLA has a certain effectiveness. Neither Spaeny nor Elordi are stars, but, their anonymity adds to their relatability. Elordi in particular, faces not only comparisons to Austin Butler's ebullient Oscar nominated performance, but decades of imitators. He humanizes the mythic figure even if, at a certain point, his lack of flash reduces the King of Rock 'N Roll to too much the mere mortal. The elephant in the room is, of course, that Elvis would be considered persona non grata in today's climate. When Priscilla first enters Graceland, Elvis' ever-present entourage are taken aback at how young she looks. Coppola exaggerates the difference by casting actors over a foot apart in height (the real difference was closer to 8""). It does make her look like a little girl (and Spaeny convincingly pulls it off despite being only a year younger than Elordi; Elvis was a decade Priscilla's senior). In Coppola (and Priscilla's) telling, Elvis isn't portrayed as making his young wife into a purely sexual object. He kept her under glass in his misguided notion that he was protecting her. To make her into an idealized good Christian girl and modern Southern belle who his recently deceased mama could have been proud of. It's an extraordinary tricky balance - particularly with the real Priscilla being a Producer on this film.By design, PRISCILLA never takes a truly deep look at all the details of the couple's lives. Colonel Tom Parker is only vaguely alluded to. The viewer sees Elvis performing only near the very end, and briefly. Once at Graceland, Priscilla is barely shown with anyone other than Elvis' posse. The movie only spans the years they were together. It's a very insular movie which relies heavily on mood and atmosphere. It will be up to each individual viewer if that is sufficient.~gortx rated NA on 9 November 2023"," Almost one of Coppola's best; Spaeny is an immediate star: Priscilla is absorbing material told with a quiet confidence; like Marie Antoinette, for at least two thirds of the way in, this feels like it is so close to being one of this director's most Formally and performance-wise impressive and inspired films. Whether you sense any deeper personal connection Coppola may have had with the story (Id need a psychology degree to unpack what it may or may not be like for this director to have been so close to a figure like Francis Coppola, though a much different context), the film largely works as a story where you get not only why a young woman would fall for this man at this time, but why it would be so hard to leave when it gets... rough.When it's Priscilla in her high school years, in total yet totally understandable infatuation with Elvis (that time period when he goes away and she counts the months by calendar, chefs kiss), and even into most of the time into Graceland, it's engrossing. The flaw is when it kept going after running out of things to say; in that sense, ironically given how they are so wholly tonally different films, this has the same problem as Luhrmann's Elvis where it covers so much ground that it runs out of steam dramatically (the Hit The Points We Know sort of thing). If you asked me which is the superior film I'll say Coppola's, but it's not by a long shot exactly, just with different strengths for each.Still, Spaeny gives, along with Dominic Sessa in The Holdovers, the OMG where did *that* come from Young actor turn of the year, as well as Elordi being ideally cast as *this* Elvis, and even with my qualms I would say to anyone vaguely interested to check it out. It's the kind of storytelling where the physical details are so impactful - watch what Priscilla does just before she goes to the hospital to give birth to her daughter, not subtle but a devastating fine-underlined point about her life as it was - and as per Coppola the production design and costuming and the camerawork is fantastic (though it took me a few minutes to adjust to how dark some of the scenes are lit).And I must also add, other mostly splendid music choices besides (sampling from 80s New Wave to Santana), the opening needle drop (""Baby, I Love You,"" by The Ramones via Phil Spector) is as nerve-tingling as the final one is tacky (I'll leave you to be the judge, but I kind of groaned at that forced romantic irony).PS: that moment when Priscilla breaks down and tells Elvis to stop reading from that book is one of my two or three favorite moments from any film this year.~Quinoa1984 rated 8/10 on 5 November 2023"," Expected more: Priscilla takes the spotlight instead of Elvis in this one. It had that retro aesthetic, but it was portrayed differently from the 50s/60s in Baz Luhrmann's 'Elvis.' This film had a more understated, even slightly gloomy vibe in comparison. Andrew just like the visuals, we get a quieter look at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla, told from her perspective.The soundtrack is nice, you don't hear much of Presley's music. Unlike last year's Elvis biopic, this one doesn't cover an entire career; it's solely focused on their marriage. It feels like we spend a significant amount of time watching how they met, but the later years felt like we were skipping stuff. Priscilla seems isolated and controlled by Elvis, whose presence is distant in the movie. The first part of the movie feels like we're sitting through Priscilla's memories, but the last half feels like we're skimming through them.It's hard not to compare them, but Austin Butler's portrayal of Elvis is better than Jacob Elordi's; Butler's performance is almost iconic. Jacob's fine, I just think there was a disconnect between Jacob's speaking voice and his singing voice. The age difference between Elvis and Priscilla is depicted better here, more creepily, mainly due to the innocence Cailee Spaeny conveys, emphasized further by the height difference.There isn't much chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla depicted in this film. Maybe it's how it was in reality and how it's depicted, but it seems like they fell in love over small talk, like ""hey, I miss home,"" ""hey, I like talking to you,"" and then it jumps to the abusive, controlling part of their relationship filled with arguments. Intimacy over small talk.I do think Cailee Spaeny did a great job as Priscilla. You can always tell how she feels, and the movie doesn't need to explicitly state ""oh, she's sad"" for you to understand. We witness the transformation of Priscilla over the years, and Spaeny flawlessly captures the journey from an innocent young fan to a frustrated woman trapped in a controlling and isolating relationship, culminating in her portrayal of a grown woman who had had enough of Elvis' behavior.Honestly, the film isn't particularly special, especially considering the visually epic story we got from the 2021 Elvis movie. I thought it would bring something different or offer deeper insights, especially since it's a well-known story and was recently told on the big screen. But it doesn't feel deeply felt or ravishingly detailed as described.Vegas backdrop looked so fake, like not even cgi, more like when they build small miniature towns and shoot those. Movie's Anticlimactic too.Certain aspects of her life are teased, like her affair with the instructor, which seems essential to the story but is only hinted at. It goes back to how the last years of their marriage are depicted, making it feel like we're skimming through memories instead of experiencing them. Maybe it was just to keep her innocence.It's a story that's already famous, so I expected this film to bring a unique and possibly deeper perspective, but it doesn't offer anything that isn't already known. It feels like it missed the mark and turned out mediocre, uninteresting, and somewhat forgettable for me.~AfricanBro rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," What did these two ever see in each other?: It's a biopic of the relationship between Priscilla Beaulieu and Elvis Presley between 1959 and 1972 in West Germany, Memphis, Tennessee, Las Vegas, and California.In 1959, Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) is the 14-year-old daughter of Ann (Dagmara Dominczyk) and her stepfather, Paul (Ari Cohen), a career military man. The family has recently been posted in West Germany, and Priscilla is lonely. 24-year-old Elvis Presley (Jacob Elordi) is serving his military time in Germany. His friend, Terry West (Luke Humphrey), notices Priscilla in a restaurant and asks if she wants to meet Elvis. Of course, she does, and her parents reluctantly allow them to meet.Elvis appears to fall for Priscilla, and they date for about six months until Elvis's tour of duty is complete, and he returns to the United States to resume his career. Three years later, in 1963, Elvis reconnects with Priscilla and invites her for a visit to Graceland. Her parents reluctantly agree. The film then follows the evolution of their relationship, including the fact that they lived together almost immediately, even as she was finishing grade 12 at a Catholic school. They finally marry in 1967, but the relationship continues downhill almost immediately.There are no good guys in this movie. Priscilla is the victim of a significant power imbalance; her primary role is to encourage the insecure ego of Elvis, who constantly needs to be surrounded by an entourage of fawning sycophants, and who introduces 17-year-old Priscilla to drugs on her first visit to Elvis in 1963. On the other hand, the movie portrays little genuine chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla except for pointless entertainment. They proclaim love for each other, but there never seems to be any depth to the relationship. And the music that shaped Elvis Presley is almost entirely absent.Cailee Spaeny does an excellent job with a mediocre story. Jacob Elordi mumbled enough to miss some of the dialogue. No one else has a personality.~steiner-sam rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," Return to Sender: I saw ""Priscilla"" yesterday. ""Priscilla"" is a 2023 American biographical drama film written, directed, and produced by Sofia Coppola, based on the 1985 memoir ""Elvis and Me"" by Priscilla Presley (who served as an executive producer) and Sandra Harmon. It stars Cailee Spaeny in the titular role and Jacob Elordi as Elvis Presley. I looked forward to seeing this film based on the rave reviews it has received. However, I must say that I was disappointed by the film. Some critics say that the movie was ""understated"" - that is an understatement! I found it to be tedious and slow. I just couldn't get invested in Cailee Spaeny's performance - it didn't grab me as authentic. She has limited range as actress - which seems to be all the way from A to B. Jacob Elordi is strikingly handsome (as Elvis was) but he doesn't seem right for the role - he is 6' 5"" and Elvis was 5' 11""! More importantly, his performance is annoying, especially when he mumbles (of course, he could be a victim of Coppola's script and direction). Speaking of writing and direction, Coppola speeds through parts of Priscilla's life towards the end whereas she spends too much in the initial buildup to the marriage. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film. As Elvis sang - ""return to sender"". 4/10.~dlmiley rated 4/10 on 1 December 2023"," Uncomfortable reality coupled with a one-dimensional narrative: Wow, this was an uncomfortable movie to watch. Priscilla invites inevitable comparisons to last year's ""Elvis,"" portraying an exact opposite narrative. Helmed by the talented Sophia Coppola, who commands great respect, and featuring Jacob Elordi, an actor I admire, the film falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, it presents a one-dimensional, flat perspective that left me somewhat disappointed.While the performances are strong, and the direction commendable, Priscilla's narrative feels tedious and slow at times. The harrowing depiction of power imbalances in the central relationship adds a layer of discomfort that makes the film hard to watch. Sophia Coppola's artistic choices unveil a side of the characters that, while impactful, renders the viewing experience challenging. Priscilla sheds light on the vulnerability of a young protagonist, emphasizing the discomfort of witnessing a story where she is just a child.~cutie7 rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Torturous, monotonous and melancholy: Discussing the loss of some brain cells while watching the film ""Priscilla"" is quite an accurate description. I had initially been eager to watch it due to my affinity for period pieces, especially those that depict real historical figures. However, this film proved to be an exercise in complete frustration within the first 15 minutes. It began with an excruciatingly slow pace, followed by a moody atmosphere that failed to captivate in a compelling manner. To make matters worse, it rapidly devolved into an incomprehensible and unpleasant production that relied on numerous quick cuts with reckless abandon.""Priscilla"" made the unfortunate decision to hop between different time periods without delving into any of the characters in a meaningful way. None of them received the development they deserved, including the title character, Priscilla. What was particularly glaring was Sophia Coppola, who directed and wrote the script. Her portrayal of Elvis was nothing short of brutal, depicting him as a mumbling, shy individual with multiple personalities, a serial cheater, bad-tempered, controlling, sexually dysfunctional, stunted in his emotional development, and plagued by a Madonna Complex.No wonder right before she passed away, Lisa Marie Presley hated everything about this script and also thought that it was akin to being a hatchet-job. I'm beginning to have some questions about Priscilla Pressley. She's been involved in too many controversies regarding her daughter, grand-daughter, Elvis and that estate. Just sayin'.First and foremost, it's hard to fathom how a parent could permit a 14-year-old to associate with, and secretly date, a man 10 years older. Even more bewildering is the decision to let her relocate back to the United States, considering her father was stationed in Germany at the time, and reside at his estate. The only explanation that seems plausible is the overpowering influence of money. Given Elvis's wealth and fame, it appears that these factors overshadowed any morality her parents may have had.The film portrays Priscilla as a pampered and privileged young girl, essentially held captive within the opulent confines of Graceland. In one scene, she expresses her desire to secure a job while attending school, telling Elvis it would be fun. However, Elvis dismisses this idea by presenting her with an ultimatum: him or a career, all while he's away filming and allegedly screwing his leading ladies.Do any of us know if all of this is completely true...no, except the fact that her parents did hand her over to Elvis while she was underage. What we also know is that a child shouldn't be living with an adult man like this, and scenes like the one I described, without any context before enduring yet another quick cut time jump, is one of the many things that made this film extremely unbearable.Also, Coppola rushing through years of multiple betrayals, sadness and pleasure at a breakneck pace, made the film feel as if she was trying to check all of the boxes on her ridiculous timeline, rather than fully immersing us in Priscilla's early life and experiences with Elvis.Now let's get to the casting. Jacob Elordi as Elvis didn't strike me as authentic. There wasn't enough suspension of disbelief in the world to buy him as the titular 50s/60s heartthrob. The difference between his Elvis and Austin Butler's Elvis is simple: Elordi played Elvis and Butler became Elvis. That's what made Butler's portrayal more believable and real. Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley was serviceable, though a bit stiff. She had 2 expressions in this film...wide-eyed, young and naive and sullen. That was about it. Even when it cut to her leaving Elvis after his Vegas show, there was nothing for the audience to get excited about. And by no means are either of these performances award-worthy, no matter what the Hollywood PR machine is spinning.In case you might be thinking about Col. Tom Parker, he never appeared in this film. You just heard Elvis on the phone with him. Even Priscilla's parents were in it sporadically. Elvis' mother was already dead and his father popped in and out with his now wife or girlfriend, that too wasn't fully explained. His grandmother, Black housekeeper and his so-called ""memphis mafia"" were seen here and there.""Priscilla"" is a torturous, monotonous and melancholy story surrounding the relationship between Priscilla and Elvis....nothing more than that. It had the potential to be a seering and engrossing film because all of the elements were there, but the ball was badly dropped and much to this film's detriment, no one took the time to find it.I usually like Sophia Coppola's films, with the exception of that abysmal ""The Beguiled"", and I'm sure I'll end up in the minority with my take about this film, but none of it worked for me. From the beginning to the end, I kept wondering what in the Hell am I watching???~syd9907 rated 1/10 on 8 November 2023"," Bland and boring: How can they make such an interesting story into such an uniteresting movie? Well, that's a good question.Some of the reasons as follows.No chemistry. No emotions. No sensuality or sex. Nothing interesting happens. No new insights. No real suspense, tension, happiness, joy or emotions. Just actors trying to act without any real feeling getting through to the viewer.And the actor that plays Elvis are to tall for the role. He doesn't come through as someone that millions of girls and guys would love. And what about the music? Just a collection of songs that have no relation to Elvis.Nope, this is just a bland and boring try to tell the Priscilla - Elvis story, without actually telling us more than a short written article could do as good, or bad.~petercarlsson-92297 rated 1/10 on 16 December 2023"," keep the home fires burning: Greetings again from the darkness. It was less than 18 months ago when Baz Luhrman's Oscar nominated ELVIS hit theaters and we were admiring Austin Butler's performance. Where that movie was glitzy and loud and centered on Elvis and Col Tom Parker, this current film from writer-director Sofia Coppola (Oscar winner for LOST IN TRANSLATION, 2003) offers a quieter, more intimate glimpse at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla through her eyes.Ms. Coppola is a detailed filmmaker who excels when dealing with personal isolation, and Priscilla makes a fitting and worthy subject. The screenplay by Coppola and Sandra Harmon is adapted from Priscilla Presley's 1985 memoir, ""Elvis and Me"", a book that also served as the basis for the 1988 TV movie of the same name (screenplay by Ms. Harmon). Although Elvis Presley Enterprises was not involved with this film (explaining the lack of familiar Elvis music), Priscilla Presley did serve as Executive Producer (EP, ironically), so her memories and preferences likely play a key role in much of what we see here.Relative newcomer Cailee Spaeny (""Mare of Easttown"") delivers an outstanding performance - from 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu in 1959 to Elvis's bride in 1967 through their divorce in 1973. Ms. Spaeny perfectly captures the wide-eyed innocence of a young fan, the frustrations of a young woman being controlled and isolated, and finally, a grown woman standing up for her own freedom. Playing Elvis through this same time period is Jacob Elordi (""Euphoria""), and he is effective in mimicking the familiar mannerisms and speaking voice. Physically, he towers over the diminutive Spaeny, which although not historically accurate, does add a dimension to the couple's disconnect. As for the age difference, the two actors are close in age, but are able to portray the actual 10 year age gap between Elvis and Priscilla.The creep factor is ever-present as 24-year-old Elvis, overseas on military duty, shows an elevated interest in 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, whose military father is also stationed in Germany. The naivety of their first meetings is captured as Elvis' beloved mother has recently passed away. Both are lonely and away from home, and Elvis simply finds her easy to talk to. It's hindsight to question how parents could allow the situation to escalate, but anyone who has parented a teenager understands the challenges. When Priscilla turns 17, she moves into Graceland, yet Elvis insists the intimacy wait until after they are married.At the core of the story is Priscilla's solitude and loneliness. She is confined to Graceland and requested to ""keep the home fires burning"" as Elvis marches off to the stream of movies set up by a never-seen-here Col Tom Parker. Keeping Parker on the phone allows Priscilla's world to remain even smaller despite being married to the biggest star on the planet. Doses of Elvis and the Memphis Mafia occur between extended stretches alone with Elvis' grandmother and personal cook. She is isolated from the real world and clearly controlled by Elvis, who was only partially present.When Priscilla and Elvis are together, the strain is apparent. Prescription drugs and sexual tension are interrupted by periodic bursts of Elvis anger, followed by a sincere apology. It's here where we realize he's more of a kid than she is ... emotionally stunted in what makes a relationship (it takes more than the tabloid reports of movie set flings Priscilla reads about). This is also evident as she watches him go through many phases in search of himself - martial arts, bible study, eastern philosophy, etc. In the family photo shoot with Lisa Marie, body language tells the whole story. Priscilla's fling with karate instructor Mike Stone is teased, but not dwelled upon. We realize that Priscilla was the one thing in life he felt he could control. By the end, one of them has escaped the cage, while the other remains captive.Voted 'Best Film' at this year's Venice Film Festival, it also reminds us what a terrific filmmaker Sofia Coppola can be. Working with a limited budget, she and her team are so proficient, it never seems as if they cut corners. Cinematographer Philipe Le Sourd and Editor Sarah Flack manage to sustain the pacing despite an inordinate amount of time Priscilla spends on her own at Graceland. Production Designer Tamara Deverell recreated the recognizable interior of Graceland, while the work of Costume Designer Stacey Battat guides us through the fashion changes that occurred over these 14 years. The film recreates some of the iconic images and moments that are ingrained in our memory banks, and director Coppola chooses to end with Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"", supposedly the song Elvis sang to Priscilla as they finalized the divorce.Opens in theaters on November 3, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 2 November 2023"

There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece.

Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.: Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further. The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.10/10.

Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in ""Oz"". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle ""good job"".~ferguson-6 rated 8/10 on 26 October 2014"," Intense: This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach) It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around. Excellence!!~bbickley13-921-58664 rated 9/10 on 22 October 2014"," A strive for perfection.: Music teacher Terrence Fletcher spots something in raw, but talented young drummer Andy Niemann, desperate to get to the top, Andy makes several sacrifices, to strive for greatness.I can't always give one hundred percent attention to a film, sometimes my mind can wander, here though, I was glued for the full run time. This film is absolutely phenomenal, a relatively low budget movie, but one with an incredible story and some phenomenal acting.How can a film be equal parts subtle and brash, I can't explain why or how, but this film has an incredibly rich content, there is so much going on beneath the surface.The characters, incredibly rich, rounded and thoroughly believable, I must start by commenting on Fletcher, he's fascinating, irascible, angry, but deep, smart, demanding and passionate. JK Simmons won an Oscar for this performance, and deservedly so, he is breathtaking here, it is acting to savour.The film is as much about Fletcher, as it is about Niemann, a total contrast, where Fletcher is hard, brash and tough, Niemann is a little naive, meak, cute, but loaded with talent, it's Fletcher's outrageous demand for perfection from him that's the key.Damien Chazelle nailed it here, the script is pretty near perfect, Oscar nominated, it should have won it.I am blown away by this incredible film, 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 6 January 2023"," A masterful tale of inspiration, set against a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation: An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead, what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and sensational drama from 2014.J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years.The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he rekindled the dying flame that is jazz.The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a ""somebody"", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning masterpiece!~CalRhys rated NA on 31 January 2015"," Blistering: Nominated for five Oscars, and winning three (editing, sound and Best Supporting Actor, with nominations for screenplay and Best picture), 'Whiplash' is positively blistering, with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that's tense and inspirational.Visually, 'Whiplash' looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful, gripping shots (like close-ups of the drum playing) and some of the tightest, cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year. The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does.The script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace.Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view.'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene.Otherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 16 February 2017"," Tension, tension, tension!: After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next ""Yardbird"" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of ""Whiplash"" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: ""What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days"".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with ""Whiplash"" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10~drakula2005 rated 9/10 on 28 October 2014"
Holiday Inn (1942) - IMDb,7.3,Bing Crosby|Fred Astaire|Marjorie Reynolds|Virginia Dale|Walter Abel|Louise Beavers|Irving Bacon|Marek Windheim|James Bell|John Gallaudet|Shelby Bacon|Joan Arnold|Bob Crosby Orchestra|Edward Arnold Jr.|Loretta Barnett|Muriel Barr|Harry Barris|Patsy Bedell,Mark Sandrich|Robert Allen(animation sequences) (uncredited),Claude Binyon|Elmer Rice|Irving Berlin,"At an inn which is open only on holidays, a crooner and a hoofer vie for the affections of a beautiful up-and-coming performer."," Bing was a marketing genius.: Finally Paramount gave Crosby a big budget musical and didn't rely on his charm and personality to carry the film. The budget went to hire such outside talent as Fred Astaire and Irving Berlin. And none of them disappoint.In the first of two films Astaire and Crosby did together the characters are remarkably the same. Astaire is the elegant and charming show business professional who's ambitious for success. Crosby is the talented, but lazy partner who just wants a life of ease and comfort and not to work more than he has to. Small wonder that their double act broke up. But now enter a complication. They both get interested in the same girl who in this film is Marjorie Reynolds.Crosby dreams up the idea of a nightclub/hotel called Holiday Inn where they only work on holidays. He wants Reynolds to help with the shows there. Astaire wants her for his act after his other girl partner Virginia Dale runs off with a millionaire. And the fun starts. Now since this was Crosby's home studio and he's first billed, just who do you think gets Reynolds in the end? As maid Louise Beavers put it, don't sit and mope because some slicker stole your gal.Irving Berlin writes a majority of new songs to supplement a couple from his vast trunk of songs mostly about our holidays. By that time Berlin had extracted an agreement which became standard for all the films he wrote for. Not one note of non-Berlin music is ever heard in a score he writes. Just listen to this and just about any other film Berlin is associated with. Even music in the background is his.The hit song in this was supposed to be Be Careful It's My Heart, the Valentine's Day song, sung by Crosby and danced to by Astaire and Reynolds. It did have a good deal of success. But the success of White Christmas was exponentially phenomenal. It netted Irving Berlin his one and only Academy Award and for Bing Crosby his number one item on vinyl. In fact everyone's number one item on vinyl.I don't know if Bing Crosby ever set out to become the voice of Christmas, but if he did he was a marketing genius. If he's known and appreciated for anything with today's audience, it's for that. White Christmas became the first Yule song he was identified with although he had recorded some Christmas material before that. After this he started doing the holiday music in serious. Just think, along around Columbus Day, record companies even now reissue his Christmas stuff every year and his totals as largest selling recording artist in history grow once again. That's why the Beatles and Elvis, etc. don't have a prayer of overtaking him.In fact White Christmas's initial success was so great that Decca wore out the original master putting out records to meet the demand. So in 1945, Decca got Bing, the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter to re-record it almost note for note. The original 78 had White Christmas with the flipside of Let's Start the New Year Right also from Holiday Inn. The newer version which most people hear has as it's flipside God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.I don't want to ignore Fred Astaire's contribution here. He does a nice comic turn with I Can't Tell a Lie, the Washington's birthday number where Crosby keeps changing the tempo to upset him and Reynolds. The Fourth of July yields a number for each. Reynolds is kept from the show by Bing's machinations and Astaire has to ""improvise"" something. He ""improvises"" Firecrackers and anyone who knows anything about Astaire knows how hard he worked to get that spontaneous feeling in his dancing. Bing sings The Song of Freedom, reminiscent of James Cagney's Grand Old Flag number from Yankee Doodle Dandy also out in 1942 and Song of Freedom is also reminiscent of what Paramount could have given Bing in the 1930s had they hired someone like Busby Berkeley to give Bing some of the production numbers that Dick Powell had at Warner Brothers.So what more is there to say, but sit back and enjoy the fun.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 25 June 2004"," Stylish, funny romantic musical: They don't get much better than this:  Astaire with the drop dead dancing cool, and Crosby with the honey crooning, both competing for the same gal. Crosby decides to let it all go and settle in the country, then on a whim realizes he can open his country house as a club open on holidays only.  The girl he ends up drafting for the floor shows ends up being the love of his life, and the dancing partner Astaire has always been searching for.Astaire, Crosby, and Reynolds have great chemistry together:  I thought it quite convincing how Crosby's overprotective zeal scared Reynolds away for a while, and Astaire was very cool and believable as a kind of an inoffensive opportunist who exploits Crosby's passionate responses to whatever threat he perceives in Astaire.  Top it off with many of Irving Berlin's best classic tunes, performed in interesting interpretations, and you have a very good musical film.~funkyfry rated 7/10 on 3 August 2003"," You shouldn't skate on ice as thin as this plot!...: ... but plot is not the point. It is pure escapist entertainment, which the homefront desperately needed in this first full year of wartime. Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) and Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) have a song and dance act that Jim retires from to go start an inn in Connecticut. After a year of this, Jim decides to convert the inn into a nightclub that is open only for holidays - 15 days a year. Put down your adding machines and forget trying to figure out the financial feasibility of this.An unknown girl comes out to the inn (Marjorie Reynolds as Linda) looking for a career in entertainment and a job, and she and Jim begin to fall for each other. But then up pops Ted, and Jim is worried that history will repeat itself and Ted will steal his new girl. Ted is the sophisticated type, Jim is the homebody type. Linda is not sure which type she is. Let the rather predictable romantic triangle that at times becomes a rectangle begin. More importantly cue the Irving Berlin songs and the great singing and dancing.Marjorie Reynolds just did not impress me, but it's not like she is awful either. She is just...there. But the back and forth between Fred and Bing is wonderful with Walter Abel as the agent lending great comic support.Odd for a 1942 film, this one does not mention WWII once. The only reference to it at all is a little bit of film of production lines of wartime equipment being made during the Independence Day number.And as for folks who dislike this movie for The Number That Shall Not Be Named, do take note that it is Louise Beavers' character that actually saves the day by getting Bing's character to come to his senses. I'll let you watch and find out what I mean. As for me, I highly recommend this. It's a great holiday film and a great feel good film.~AlsExGal rated 9/10 on 24 December 2018"," Happy Holidays...Start with this movie.: This film is good in so many ways.  The song and dance numbers were all great.  Teaming Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire was a great idea.  These two played off each other so well that I can't imagine two other actors doing so well.  Even Crosby and Hope wouldn't have done as well here.  Marjorie Reynolds was a treat to look at but also had good chemistry with both Crosby and Astaire.  The support cast was equally as good, Walter Abel as Danny Reed, Virginia Dale as Lila Dixon and Louise Beavers as Mamie gave solid performances.  The set was also beautiful.  Obviously the Hollywood set of Holiday Inn at the end of the film that was supposed to be a reproduction of the real Holiday Inn in Connecticut is the same set used for both scenes.  However it is such a realistic set that the viewer never suspects that the Connecticut scenes were filmed indoors.  I think the fact that the film was in black and white helps in that respect.  A color film may have actually looked more phoney.  The story is a simple one but well put together.  I think many viewers can relate to guys trying to steal girls from one another, its a common enough practice today.  The ending is a bit fairy tale like but then that is why so many probably like it.  We get enough ""reality"" in our every day lives.  It is nice to escape reality with a film like this.Lastly, the black face scene during the Lincoln Day performance is offensive but it does not ruin the film.  Of course a minstrel show today using black face would be unacceptable in today's environment but you can't hold a 1940's film to the same standards.  I know some would like to have that scene removed from the film but I disagree.  I am of African American decent and while I could view this film as a disgrace I accept it for what it is. Rather than try and obliterate scenes such as this from our film history I think they should be viewed as stepping stones to where African Americans are in film today.  There may still be barriers that need to be broken through in the film world but considering where African Americans started we as a society should also take time to appreciate the accomplishments that have been achieved.  Black face is out.  Demeaning ""yesum"" roles are for the most part gone and now leading roles that portray African Americans in well to do positions in society are becoming more and more frequent.  So while some of the film history regarding African Americans portrays them in a negative manner it is because of those actors and actresses were able to work in those roles and under those conditions that the modern day African American actors and actresses are able be seen in a more positive light. Ignoring the past roles ignores the actors and actresses that struggled through those times.~AbeStreet rated NA on 6 December 2002"," A True Classic: This is truly one of the great musicals to ever grace the silver screen. Between the great song, the dance numbers and the chemistry between Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, this film really is one of the the all time classics. What really makes it great is that it pretty much plays like a great Broadway review that uses the different holidays as an excuse to display the individual talents of each of the film's stars. However, the thing that this film will truly be remembered for is the fact that it introduced one of the all time classic song's to the world, ""White Christmas"".Another thing that makes this film so beloved is that it came out during a time when America needed somewhat of a diversion, World War II. This film helped to give people something to put smiles on their faces as the whole world was going to hell. At least for two hours, this film helped America to forget its troubles and put a smile on everyone's faces.~Sargebri rated NA on 24 December 2004"," Seasons Greetings: HOLIDAY INN (Paramount, 1942), directed by Mark Sandrich, with adaptation by Elmer Rice, based on the idea by Irving Berlin, stars crooner Bing Crosby and dancer Fred Astaire for the first time (their second would be BLUE SKIES in 1946). In their best on-screen collaboration, they play a couple of song and dance men who vie for the affection of a female dancing partner. While the movie itself has been long associated with Christmas, hence the introduction to Irving Berlin's Academy Award winning tune of ""White Christmas,"" HOLIDAY INN features songs for almost all holidays, however, this is the kind of movie that can be aired on television at anytime, whether it be Easter or Fourth of July, but it is that wonderful time of Christmas that has long become associated with the musical of HOLIDAY INN.Opening and closing with a focus of a calendar, which is used throughout the film when centering around a certain holiday, the plot, set in a two year span, centers upon Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) and Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire), friends and entertainers working at the Club Pierre in New York City with Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale) as the third party to the trio. Although Jim has plans on retiring from show business and spending the rest of his life on the farm with his future bride, Lila, the big surprise comes when Jim discovers Lila loves Ted and intends to marry him instead. So as Jim resides alone at his farm in Midville, Connecticut, he becomes lonely, and a year later, decides to combine the best of both worlds by turning his farmhouse into a night club opened only on holidays, leaving Jim ""347 days in which to kick around in,"" appropriately calling it Holiday Inn. Jim later hires Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), a former flower shop girl wanting a career in show business, as one of the entertainers at the inn. On New Year's Eve, Ted gets a ""Dear John"" letter from Lila that she has broken their engagement to marry a Texas millionaire instead. Depressed and later drunk, Ted comes to Jim's Holiday Inn where he unwittingly stumbles upon Linda on the dance floor and starts dancing with her, much to the pleasure of the patrons. Ted's agent Danny Reed (Water Abel), who has only seen the girl from the back, convinces Ted that this girl (whom he'd remember if he danced with her again) would make him a fine new dancing partner. Not wanting to lose another girl to Ted, Jim decides to keep him and Linda apart through various schemes, and after Ted and Linda do form a partnership, it appears that history is destined to repeat itself.Aside from two guys and a girl theme, the score by Irving Berlin and performance by the two leading men make up for some of the weak spots. Songs include: ""Happy Holidays"" (sung briefly during opening credits); ""I'll Capture Your Heart Singing/Dancing"" (sung by Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire and Virginia Dale); ""Lazy"" (medley, sung by Crosby); ""You're Easy to Dance With"" (sung by Fred Astaire/danced by Astaire and Dale); ""White Christmas"" (sung by Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds); ""Happy Holidays"" (sung by Crosby, Reynolds and chorus); ""Let's Start the New Year Right"" (sung by Crosby); ""Abraham"" (sung by Crosby, Reynolds, Louise Beavers and chorus); ""Be Careful, It's My Heart"" (sung by Crosby/ danced by Astaire and Reynolds); ""Washington's Birthday March (I Cannot Tell a Lie)"" (sung by Astaire/ danced by Astaire and Reynolds); ""Easter Parade"" (sung by Crosby); ""The Song of Freedom"" (sung by Crosby/ firecracker dance by Astaire); ""I've Got Plenty to Be Thankful For"" (sung by Crosby); ""White Christmas"" (reprise by Reynolds and Crosby) and ""I'll Capture Your Heart"" (with Crosby, Astaire, Reynolds and Dale).While HOLIDAY INN was intended to feature songs for all holidays of the year, some were obviously omitted, intentionally or unintentionally, including a song or a song to Memorial Day and Labor Day, yet a production number for Valentine's Day (February 14th) is hardly considered a holiday of any kind, but is included as part of a holiday number just the same. While Irving Berlin could write so many songs, it leaves one to wonder what he could have done with a song for Halloween Once upon a time, birthdays to two U.S. Presidents, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, were national holidays. While Washington's birthday is currently celebrated as a day off in many states, Lincoln's birthday is no longer considered a time off from school or work. Since the 1970s, the production number, ""Abraham,"" dedicated to Abe Lincoln, usually got deleted when aired on commercial television. Even the original 1979 motion picture soundtrack from Sunbeam Records included every song from the film except for ""Abraham."" The ""Abraham"" number was later restored when distributed to video cassette in the 1980s.Also seen in the supporting cast consists of Louise Beavers Mamie, Jim's housekeeper; Irving Bacon as Gus; John Gallaudet as Mr. Parker; James Bell as Mr. Dunbar; and Shelby Bacon and Joan Arnold as Mamie's children, Vanderbilt and Daphne.Aside from its annual revivals on commercial television on Christmas Eve, HOLIDAY INN has played on any given time on cable television's American Movie Classics from 1994 to 2000 to Turner Classic Movie where it premiered July 16, 2003. Having once aired on the Disney Channel in the 1990s, it eliminated the segment leading to the ""Abraham"" number. While HOLIDAY INN is a reflection of the times, it hasn't really aged a bit, making it a wonderful package to Holiday movies, improving every time it airs. At 101 minutes, the film goes by very quickly. Even with black and white photography, it's a very effective film, ranking it one of the best musicals to come out from the 1940s. In spite of their on screen rivalry, Crosby and Astaire make a fine twosome who'll capture your hearts singing and dancing. (***1/2).~lugonian rated 10/10 on 24 December 2002"," THE FILM EVEREST OF HOLIDAY MUSICALS: Holiday Inn (1942) directed by Mark Sandrich, stars a laid back, crooning Bing Crosby, and a suave, dancing Fred Astaire. Without question Holiday Inn is a genuine, universally admired classic film, specifically created to showcase music from composer Irving Berlin. The prolific Berlin wrote twelve original songs for Holiday Inn, with the best known being his mega hit tune, ""White Christmas."" Holiday Inn, in unsophisticated black and white, may arguably be the ""Film Everest"" of all musicals past and present. Indeed, the song, ""White Christmas,"" is still one of the most recorded, played, and performed songs in music history.The charming, straightforward plot, is quite simple. Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) has decided he's had enough of show business, nightlife, and endless travel. Hardy then purchases a small farm in Midville, Connecticut, and though he feels he made the right decision to leave show biz for a life on the farm, this kind of rural retirement Nirvana doesn't last long. After a series of ""farm failures,"" Hardy converts his project into a nightclub that is only open on holidays, and hence, ""Holiday Inn."" Hardy's novel concept is fairly simple: You work 15 days of the year (with some time thrown in for rehearsals, arranging music, setting up the proper holiday theme at the Inn), essentially doing the kind of things you truly enjoy. This is actually an ingenious concept when you stop and think about it, so much so that the real Holiday Inn chain of hotels was intentionally named after this film.Hardy soon falls in love with aspiring actress Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), who is also being aggressively pursued by dance celebrity Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire). Yeah, forget that Ted and Hardy are best friends, and forget that Ted has routinely stolen all of Hardy's former girlfriends. This is all about love, and this kind of subtle, ""gentlemanly combat"" means that the girl can only go to the winner. Bing, Astaire, and Reynolds become featured at the Inn where they perform heart thumping dance and song, the likes of which, will probably never be surpassed. Holiday Inn is a solid testimony to the kind of classic fare that a more artistic yet conventional Hollywood used to generate with apparent ease in the 1930s and 1940s.Twelve years later, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen would team up for White Christmas (1954) in what would ironically become the ""better known"" perennial holiday film. And though this ""loose remake"" of Holiday Inn would be filmed in blazing Technicolor instead of stark black and white, and would again include a bevy of Irving Berlin hit compositions (with Bing reprising ""White Christmas""), it lacks the essential cast chemistry and charm of its predecessor.But Hollywood never stands still, and every now and then, we see flashing glimpses of that beautiful era in more contemporary musicals such as La La Land (2016). My personal hope is that film history will, at least in this genre, repeat itself, again . . . And again . . . And again.~Sunsphxsuns rated 10/10 on 26 November 2018"," Holiday Inn is an uplifting and heartwarming remembrance that is a legend in its own right.: In any endeavor there are greats, and there are legends.  Bing Crosby crooned his way to the latter status years before this movie, and he is in fine voice here.  It is such a shame that things like talent aren't present in music anymore, but if you want to remember it, this is a great vehicle. Irving Berlin, Crosby's long time friend, wrote magical numbers for the film, including the unforgettable White Christmas.Fred Astaire gave a tour de force performance, singing, and, of course, dancing his way through this delightful piece in rare form.  It is said that he worked so hard during rehearsals that he wasted away to 85 pounds by the time he filmed the firecracker number.  He might just as well have been weightless, because he defies gravity with his every move.Marjorie Reynolds was seriously outclassed in a role that was intended for Mary Martin, who probably could have improved the chemistry of the starring cast.  Reynolds nevertheless does a creditable job, and Holiday Inn remains her finest hour.Years later, Paramount undertook a vastly inferior remake entitled White Christmas, which failed to capture a fraction of the magic of Holiday Inn. Astaire was replaced with funny man Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney gave it her torch song damndest, but it didn't gel.  Holiday Inn has more wit, sincerity, charm and, despite being over a decade older, freshness.  Holiday Inn is an uplifting and heartwarming remembrance that is a legend in its own right.~budmassey rated 10/10 on 28 November 2003"," Great musical revue with a plot: What's not to like about this movie? ""Holiday Inn"" fits in many film genres -- comedy, musical, romance, drama and Christmas. It's one of the best efforts of Hollywood to make a musical revue with a plot. It succeeds marvelously in that and gives us some of the best song and dance routines of the day. The film is a showcase of Irving Berlin music, dancing by the greatest dancer of the silver screen (Fred Astaire), and singing by the top male singer of the early decades of filmdom (Bing Crosby). Crosby and Astaire together are a sure fire combination for entertainment. Crosby plays Jim Hardy and Astaire plays Ted Hanover. While they dominate the film, a small supporting cast fills in the details, mostly in the plot aspects. Virginia Dale and Marjorie Reynolds are the romance interests of both Jim and Ted, as Lila Dixon and Linda Mason, respectively. They both dance very well with Astaire. Linda has some songs with Jim, but her voice is dubbed by Martha Mears. Walter Abel as Danny Reed, Louise Beavers as Mamie and Irving Bacon as Gus are nice window dressing in the plot mostly with comedy. Astaire has two first time and exceptional dance numbers in this film. The first is the firecracker dance and the second is a soused Ted Hanover who gives a funny but superb drunken dance. Work on the film began before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and with its release to be early in the war, the studio added a patriotic number with some films clips. Of course, Irving Berlin's music holds sway with this great piece of entertainment. The master composer wrote a dozen songs that were used for this film. Some were originals (i.e., ""Happy Holiday"" and ""White Christmas""), and others were reprisals (i.e., ""Easter Parade""). Most were recorded separately before being used in the film. If for no other reason, ""Holiday Inn"" will be remembered as the movie that brought ""White Christmas"" to a worldwide audience. Crosby sang Berlin's ""White Christmas"" for its first ever performance on the radio broadcast of the Kraft Music Hall show of Christmas Day, 1941. He subsequently was the first to record the song, on May 29, 1942, for Decca Records. After ""Holiday Inn"" came out in August 1942, the song got worldwide attention. It was wildly popular among American GIs and others serving during World War II.The history of that single song is interesting. No one at first thought of it as a sure-fire top hit song. Berlin and Crosby liked it, but they and the people at Paramount thought that the hit number of ""Holiday Inn"" would be, ""Be Careful, It's My Heart."" According to the Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's rendition of ""White Christmas"" is the best-selling single song of all time. It had more than 100 million sold (by 2010). All versions of the song, including Crosby's, have sold more than 150 million copies. Guinness states that there are more than 500 versions of the song recorded in various languages. Besides Bing Crosby, many other top singers have recorded ""White Christmas"" over time. They include: Frank Sinatra in 1944, Perry Como in 1947, Elvis Presley in 1957, Johnny Mathis in 1958, Andy Williams in 1963, Doris Day in 1964, Barbra Streisand in 1967, Tony Bennett in 1968, John Denver in 1975, Willie Nelson in 1979, Dolly Parton in 1984, Neil Diamond in 1992, Linda Ronstadt in 2000, Bette Midler in 2003, Dionne Warwick in 2004, and Ray Stevens in 2009, ""Holiday Inn"" is a wonderful movie that the whole family should enjoy.~SimonJack rated 10/10 on 14 December 2016"," Musical Treat: Lots of fun.

But one movie stands out for me: La La Land.It's perfectly shot, the acting is underplayed in a time when most cinematic blockbusters overact like they are on stage with Jerry Springer. The music is exceptional and the colour is something out of a fairytale.I understand why people don't like musicals. That's your call. Don't rate it then. I don't rate superhero movies because I know the good guys will defeat the bad guys in a predictable monstrosity to chase revenue. This movie doesn't have fight scenes or a shootout or car chase - it's about one basic premise we all face in life - do you follow your dream or your heart?It's a combination of everything that's great about the movies and it shows restraint at the end when it could have easily chosen a different path for our couple.It's funny in parts, excruciatingly sad in others. It finds the perfect balance. It's a masterpiece.~tuggerwaugh rated 10/10 on 7 February 2020"," Dream or Love: I love you, you can not spend time with me, but it is taboo to look down on my dreams.

'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 12 January 2017"," Loving you is like loving part of my life: This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.~IreneWatsonC rated 8/10 on 4 April 2020"," Nostalgic, Colourful, Joyous CinemaScope Magic: Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.~CalRhys rated NA on 18 January 2017"," Love letter to Hollywood .. and a Heck of a Film: Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods.Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic.

The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is ""a dying art"".Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it's not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She's given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song ""Audition"" near the end.There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", and ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film's greatness.The reference to ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" comes through strongly in the movie's final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side. The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy.The teaming of director/writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Damien Chazelle2) Acting by Emma Stone3) Music by Justin Hurwitz~proud_luddite rated 9/10 on 20 March 2018"," For The Love Of Movies: Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy.

I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace.

Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.Austin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.This biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.Both stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.Austin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.At times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .Many other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.Unlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.I'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.There were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.The Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .All biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.The opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.There's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.Those who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.The supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .I personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.~tm-sheehan rated 7/10 on 23 June 2022"," Entertaining, But Can't Get Out Of Its Own Way Enough To Be Great: There are certainly times in which Baz Luhrmann's ""Elvis"" is an engaging and entertaining biopic of rock-and-roll's biggest star. The performance numbers are often incredible and Austin Butler inhabits all aspects/ages of the lead role adeptly. Unfortunately, Luhrmann's let's say ""unique"" style of filmmaking can't quite get out of its way long enough (especially in the early goings) for this to be a top-notch flick.For a very basic overview, ""Elvis"" tells the story of the titular character (played by Butler) from childhood all the way through his Vegas residency at the end of his career. The narrative frame comes from the voice of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks), Presley's manager and quasi-abuser (largely in the financial department). Elvis's relationship to ""black music"", teen heartthrob fame, military service, and late-60s comeback are all given time here, including his marriage to Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge).Perhaps the most notable thing to mention about ""Elvis"" is that the first 30-45 minutes are kind of a mess. Luhrmann is in peak wackadoodle form (granted, what else could be expected from the director of 1996's ""Romeo + Juliet""), what with jarring time-cuts, crazy montages (one that turns the proceedings into a comic book!), and quite a bit of time spent on the bizarre Hanks Parker portrayal. There is also a far-too-on-the-nose scene in which a young Presley supposedly learns his later musical style via an R&B jam session and a revival ministry happening concurrently. I'd blame no one for thinking this was a total mess before the 1 hour mark.Fortunately, in this case, there is still 2 hours left of ""Elvis"", and that's when it settles into being a pretty entertaining film. Basically, once all the crazy material is out of the way and audiences can just settle into Butler's portrayal, there is a lot to like. I was really impressed with Butler's ability to portray the young rebellious Elvis, as well as the fat, worn-down-by-life version. The staged musical numbers are every bit as good as those found in recent musical biopics like Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody. I'll certainly be revisiting some Presley tunes after seeing this.Overall, I can't put ""Elvis"" in my top tier (Walk the Line, Love & Mercy, & Judy) of biopics because its director seems almost physically unable to ""tell it straight"" when this film and acting performances would have certainly been good enough for that grounded approach. But it was easily good enough to hold my interest and take me on an interesting journey through the iconic musician's entire career.~zkonedog rated 7/10 on 4 July 2022"," Incredibly exciting and a roller coaster of emotions! Incredible performance by Austin Butler: Elvis is a movie everyone needs to see! One of the greatest biopics is finally here and it does not disappoint. Fans of all generations will love this film for years to come.Elvis is told from the point of view of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks) who used to be Elvis's manager. He tells the story of how he met Elvis (Austin Butler) and how the singer took the world by storm. The film covers the years of Elvis's life as a young adult until his passing.This is an incredible and exciting film. From the opening scene until the credits roll, the movie is a roller coaster of emotions. Austin's performance as the king of Rock n Roll is revolutionary. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him. He truly becomes Elvis with his mannerisms and dancing. Austin's performance is Oscar-worthy, just like the rest of the film. The movie humanizes Elvis, where audiences see him as more than just a performer. It's heartbreaking to see how this larger-than-life legend never lived the life he wanted. The film unites both Elvis fans and non-enthusiasts by showing this icon in a never-before-seen profile. Following Elvis throughout his life and witnessing his love of music made me feel as if he's been a friend of mine for years. Producer/Director/Writer, Baz Lurhmann delivers an incredible film and story here. It is completely engaging, has a perfect mix of modern music and Elvis classics, along with swapping between Elvis and the Colonel's points of view. Archival elements such as newspaper headlines and comic book art are put to good use and the film ends with a video recording of Elvis's last concert. The costumes are spectacular. The scene of Elvis's Las Vegas residency wearing his iconic white suit is beautiful since it looks like the viewers are watching a live performance. This is one movie that you should watch in theaters to capture its greatness. The music blaring; Austin's acting; and the cinematography should be experienced on the big screen.Elvis offers several themes, but the most important one is to live the life you want to. Elvis's mother warned him of living a life to please others and that he would eventually lose himself, which is exactly what happened. Elvis never lived his life for himself and, in the end, it consumed him.I give Elvis 5 out 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. It premieres in theaters June 24, 2022.

Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given. The music varies, at times it's fantastic, others it's inappropriate and awkward.Absolute waste of Austin Butlers performance.~slak96u rated 6/10 on 8 August 2022"," Incredibly Annoying: Austin Butler's performance as Elvis Presley is quite literally the only saving grace in this whole godforsaken movie.Not even Butler's inspired performance could save this absolute dumpster fire of a film. Elvis is one of the most vapid, obnoxious, superficial, headache-inducing movies I've seen in I didn't even know how long. Elvis is so bad that it actually makes Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody look like a masterpiece. I despise this movie, and I knew that I would which was why I put off watching it for so long.Baz Luhrmann is one of the very few filmmakers that I legitimately loathe. Both Romeo and Juliet and The Great Gadsby were two of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. To say that Luhrmann's movies are all style and no substance would be the understatement of the century. I knew within 10 minutes of watching Elvis that Luhrmann had no genuine intentions of telling an authentic and mature story about Elvis Presley. Instead, he was more focused on making a 2 and a half hour music video that has even less depth and heart than Elvis's Wikipedia page.Baz Luhrmann's directing style is so aggressively annoying that it feels like he's trying to cater this movie to an audience of ADHD-stricken toddlers. The editing in this film felt like it was done by cokeheads. Most shots in this movie lasted less than 5 seconds. I know that because I counted. This movie cannot sit still. On top of that, there is the classic Luhrmann trademark of adding crappy pop and rap music to all of his films which never works and always feels out of place. This movie even went as far as taking Elvis' songs and remixing them with random modern pop artists. The most nauseating example of this was when they remixed Viva Las Vegas with Britney Spears' Toxic. I'm not kidding.This movie feels like a bad joke. All the authenticity that was desperately needed in order for the film to have any sort of emotional impact gets completely wiped out by Luhrmann's overly flashy visual nonsense. I felt nothing watching this movie, even in its most dramatic moments.There were numerous times when this movie went full-on Dewey Cox and didn't even see the irony. And don't get me started on Tom Hanks, oh boy. What happened Tom? This is easily the worst Tom Hanks has ever been in a movie, EVER. I challenge anyone to find me another Tom Hanks movie where he sucked this hard. It was beyond embarrassing.Out of all the best picture-nominated films I've seen in my lifetime, Elvis just might be the very worst. This is an awful movie in practically every regard.~nathandm-75297 rated 1/10 on 16 February 2023"," Totally Overrated: For the first two hours it felt like I was watching the longest music video of all time. It was all over the place and extremely rushed. And what was up with the soundtrack? Why the hell was there a Backstreet Boys song in the film? Not to mention the Hip Hop? I didn't get it. This film was hard to get through and I couldn't take Austin Butler serious. I was glad when it was over. I guess if you're a fan of Elvis give it a shot. If not, pass on it, it's nothing special. Basic 5 star film.~Draysan-Jennings rated 5/10 on 18 August 2022", Ugh Tom Hanks: For me Tom Hanks looked and sounded ridiculous. His makeup was absurd and his voice was irritating. Austin looked good and the wardrobe was ok but the movie was one long muddled weird music video. For some reason they portrayed Elvis as a whiny wimpy immature baby and that was not what I had heard he was like especially from my father who did a movie with him. This movie is really terrible. The entire first 20 minutes is a total waste of time. I think putting Tom Hanks in any role in any movie is just too hard to not just see Tom Hanks! And I was way done with this movie after an hour but for some reason it just kept going on and on. Ugh really terrible!~hpcmakeup rated 2/10 on 5 September 2022," I can't put my finger on why but was a little disappointed with this movie: Firstly Austin Butler was great , he could actually be Elvis as he looked so much like him and clearly worked hard to do Elvis justice , but I didn't really enjoy the movie but can't put my finger on why , the Main actors did a good job but I couldn't really get an emotional connection with them or the story line until the very end , I thought the legend Tom Hanks had too much of a part to play and Elvis didn't get enough , the story seemed to bounce all over the place and to me just felt and bit disjointed , Im no movie critic or expert so I recommend seeing it as lots have really raved about it but I woo the be watching it again.~mikemars38 rated 6/10 on 25 June 2022"," What movie is everyone else watching?: I normally love Baz Luhrmann's films but this was a chore to sit through. When I sit down to watch a film about Elvis I expect the soundtrack of the film to be full of Elvis music or even the music that inspired him. Why they decided to have this film filled with modern day hiphop/rap music is beyond me and it totally detracts from the story. Apart from that the acting in this makes it feel like a direct to dvd film you'd rent out of the redbox, even that from Tom Hanks! I had such a hard time getting through this 3 hour film, I honestly don't understand how it has such a high score.If you are a fan of the king I highly recommend watching Elvis from 1979 with Kurt Russell instead of this.~DeadMansTrousers rated 3/10 on 9 August 2022"

At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film.~Hitchcoc rated 10/10 on 19 January 2019"," A captivating watch, with sensational acting.: Not often these days so I give ten stars to a film, with Green Book however, I had no other choice, this film had me totally captivated.It's a fascinating story, I had no idea that it was based on true events, temporarily losing his job at a club, Tony Lip Vallelonga gets a job driving for Doctor Don Shirley. Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 January 2021"," Green Book: This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 14 February 2020"," Ranks #5 on my IMDb Top 25 Best Buddy Films List. A Feel Good Movie at its Core: Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended.~Instant_Palmer rated 9/10 on 26 June 2020"," ""It takes courage to change people's hearts."": In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart.~classicsoncall rated 9/10 on 5 March 2019"," ""Green Book"" is Gold: We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is themovie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!~taylor_king-890-815491 rated 10/10 on 25 November 2018"," A perfect example of Yin & Yang - and black and white has nothing to do with it.: Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.Great performances from the entire cast, especially Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who were perfectly cast and convincing in their roles. It was also great to see comedian Sebastian Maniscalco in this film as well.Writer, director and producer Peter Farrelly nailed every aspect of this biography.The score, cinematography, sets and visuals were all on point.I'm not a fan of slow paced long films, but this was was close to an exception. I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.Excellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.A well deserved 8/10 from me.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 2 January 2019"," A re-awakening journey: My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 10 December 2019"," A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.: I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been conditioned to abide to his whole life.~BassLightyear rated 7/10 on 26 February 2019"," Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner: Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.~Art Snob rated 9/10 on 22 September 2018"

We first noted that every girl was dressed up and was just so happy. When the film started, there was an excitement I've never experienced. Everyone was so happy. The film started and we soon realized this would be different than anything we've experienced. As soon as the music started, every girl in the theater started to sing. And, I mean sing loud. We looked at each other and wondered if it was just the first song. Nope. It wasn't the first song as it would be every single song after that. I've never experienced anything like this in a theater. It was so much fun and highly recommended.~robby77777 rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Kind of hard to review this one, but yeah, I see the hype: My wife is an ENORMOUS Taylor Swift fan and we've been trying to get tickets to see this concert for months. Suffice to say, when tens of millions of people across Canada are also trying, it's not very easy. Taking her to see this was a treat, even if our theatre was kind of quiet and lame. We genuinely expected more of a concert vibe, but unfortunately, even the amazing staff at our cinema, who tried their hardest to hype people up, couldn't do it.To say that this concert really fits the cinematic experience would be an understatement. You don't have to love TS (although, 17 years of making music, there has to be a couple songs you know...admit it), but this concert does a phenomenal job of showcasing what makes her special. The sets, the outfits, the distinct visual and sonic style of the Eras...let's just say, the whole room shimmers.Taylor is an incredible performer and has amazing stage presence. She simultaneously feels like a a girl sitting on the bleachers and trouble as soon as she walks in. Her outfits gleam in the Los Angeles night and she commands the room in a way few artists do. For the film specifically, the cinematography is honestly fantastic and not only makes you feel as it you're on stage with her, but allows you take in the enormity of the moment tooDon't what else to say, if you're a Swifty, you belong in a theatre watching this thing. If you're not, you'll be enchanted to meet her.(And yes, this concert did what all great concerts do. Make you appreciate the artist even more. I'm a soft Swifty now.)~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 9/10 on 17 October 2023"," A newer, better and cheaper way to enjoy a concert: Not only were Swift's tickets expensive as hell (700+ for a VIP. What?) but I would have had to travel to a different city and stay the night in a hotel to see the concert.Not worth it.So I was really pleased when Swift announced a movie of her 3 hour long concert for theaters.And boy was this amazing.The sets, the costumes, the lighting, the props and the videos were absolutely sublime and gorgeous to look at. The dancers and the backup singers gave it their all in their choreography and singing.And then there's Taylor herself.Her goofy, lovable personality was on full display, as well as her prowess and blooming confidence as she strutted the stage in hella sparkly costumes crooning out all of her best hits from all her albums.Had I been there, no doubt my bank account would have been empty and I would have ended up being squeezed with a bunch of Swifties, barely catching a glimpse of the songstress. Instead, the camera focuses lovingly on Taylor from all angles throughout the show. And no extra charge for a pair of glasses. Plus I giggled as the ardent Swifties in the cinema got up from their seats to dance and form circles in front of their beloved.Great choice to film and to share it in the cinema. :)~Avwillfan89 rated 9/10 on 19 October 2023"," Spectacular sets, choreography, music and cinimatography: I am hardly what I would consider to be in the ""Taylor Swift"" demographic. A man past 70. But a female friend of mine liked it, and I like music so I went to see it tonight.This is called the ""Eras Tour"" because the 3 hour show is divided into the various eras of her songwriting, with different stage sets and dress for each ""era"".I read a few weeks ago, in the WSJ of all places, a bit about her tour - requiring 50 semis to carry all of the stage equipment from city to city. I was thinking just of the logistics and of all the people ""behind the scenes"" who put all of this together.When you see the show, you wonder how they could do all of this in 50 trucks.This was filmed at the last stop of her tour, the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, CA.It was sold out.The visuals are spectacular, the costumes, sets, and of course her music.And you are right on stage with her.It isn't simply a recording of the show with 2 or 3 cameras angles but a very well thought out production and with a mystery to me, not an external camera in sight as you see various angles of the massive stage.Very well done in all respects.~wlb rated 9/10 on 21 October 2023"," 🎆 WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE! 🎇⚡: Just Got out Of The Eras Tour Dolby Cinema, I'm Going to See this Again in IMAX next Weekend.Taylor Swift is such an Efficient and Unique Performer and her Songwriting is at times Remarkable (Yes, I know she has Co-writers for Many of her Songs). 🎤Taylor Swift -1. She's Gorgeous to look at.2. She was Performing so well in the Routines and Singing.3. The Edits were Spot on 👌4. The Cinematography was in certain Scenes Breathtaking (especially the Shots of Taylor Swift with the Huge Scale Audience or Stage Behind her)5. Her Speeches in Between every other Couple of Segments added even more to the Show.6.

She has a know-how, she has a Brightness or Likeability to her Facial Expressions, also her Physiognomy coupled with her own added personal Face Mannerisms and Look Mannerisms adds more to her. She also has this certain type of Elegance about her that adds to her Singular Ability to pull off what she does and how she does it. She's a Superstar.There's a few moments when the crowd was just applauding and cheering for Taylor and it was Roaring in Dolby Cinema.It was Such an Outstanding PerformanceBonus - She has Great Face Symmetry both when Frowning and Smiling 👌Segments -Lover - Excellent introduction to the Show 👌💖.

Sure, we didn't get to see the concert live... but this was very much the next best thing (especially in IMAX with a large crowd of excited, passionate Swifties)! It made for such a fun, truly impressive experience! It's truly a spectacular achievement in terms of cinematography, editing and sound for a concert film - it's really something special to treasure forever. I would even say this is likely the greatest concert film ever made... due to both the insane production value of the show, and the impressive work put in to film it all! Some of the shots/coverage they got blew me away, and the sound was excellent! They did such a good job of making you feel like you were there, feeling the energy and emotion of every song along with the crowd at SoFi stadium! It's infectious, and my god is it ever so exhilarating to experience with a full theatre of fans!But nothing would have made this experience what it is if it wasn't for Taylor Swift herself, who enchants with talent, charisma, grace and stamina to carry such a long event like it was the easiest and most natural thing! She puts on a show that can feel intimate even in a stadium setting. Swift has a way of making every viewer feel like she's personally performing for them whether they are sitting in the back row of a stadium or in a movie theatre. This is possibly the most famous performer in the world, but she engages her audience with humility. She's such a talented performer and put together one of the most elaborate and stunning concerts I've ever seen.My favourite eras during the concert: Lover, Red, 1989 and especially Reputation!Excellent vibes, unparalleled cinematic experience for a concert. It's a must see in IMAX!Only problem is it made me want to see this show live even more...~parksiet rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Taylor Swift - Phenomenal Performer, Businesswoman, & Human Being: I got the luxury of seeing this beautifully produced film of Taylor's Eras Tour on opening night at the Big Mo Drive-In Theater (Monetta, South Carolina). Taylor did not fly in on a helicopter, but emotionally, I felt like she did! It was packed with Swifties & other people from all walks of life. It started out and people were screaming and clapping as if it were the actual concert. The movie itself had effortless transitions and preserved the beauty throughout the concert. I am a trained opera singer with a degree in Vocal Performance (I even have perfect pitch) , and I am here to say that Taylor sang with marvelous pitch, technique, resonance, and stage presence throughout the concert film. Her entire team of singers & dancers were great, as well, and I mean phenomenally great! The actors featured in her story songs in Folklore and Evermore were amazing, as well! In my opinion, there weren't any weak points in the entire movie. Her mini-speeches beautifully connected the songs when she chose to add them in, her outfits were gorgeous, & her live performances of HER music was unmatched. Is it too early to say it was timeless? ;)~Gleek4eva rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Tour of an Era: I've heard that Swift's concerts are expensive to attend to. So recording them and putting them into an accessible format she can monetize even more, is just good business. Just like how I constantly see BTS' events here, where we are far and away from anywhere.If you are not a fan of her safe and generic songs, there's nothing to get out of this, as the theatrics do little to impress or highten the shallow experience.. it's just not the same as being surrounded by thousands of people, and enjoying the energy. Here you get 3 long hours of an exhausting event and nothing more. There's no added backstage recordings, preparations or stories to tell or anything that would make this a worthwhile for movie goers.. so calling this a ""movie"" is somewhat insulting (but it does help in selling it, I guess).You know who you are and what you like, so the recommendation is a no brainer.~daisukereds rated 4/10 on 18 October 2023"," Good, but not great: First off, I want to say I went to the Eras Tour in Los Angeles on night four, right after a the filming of this movie. It was awesome! By far the most fun I've ever had at a concert. So I was glad to hear the movie of this show was coming sooner than expected. That's where I think they went wrong. The grand scale of this show wasn't showcased in this movie. There were too many closeups of Taylor and not enough wide shots of the stage sets and the stadium/crowd. The sound was good, but honestly I thought it could have been better. I just don't think the production had enough time to properly mix the audio. I thought the Reputation All Stadium Tour film was really good, and with all the hype surrounding this epic tour, a little more time editing of this film could have made it even better. My hope is that there will eventually be a Directors cut, or maybe a Taylor cut that includes all the songs, including the surprise songs in the future. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm putting down the production, I am not. With the time they had, I'm sure it's the best they could do. Great job though, recording a live 3-1/2 hour show and editing out all the cameras must have taken up most of the time because on first viewing I didn't see a single camera. I can't wait to see this again at home and enjoy the Eras Tour for many years to come.~themanford rated 8/10 on 16 October 2023"," Even those who aren't fans of Taylor Swift, this concert movie is still a really fun to watch: As a whole, it was a good watch.It's a fun concert movie with great production, camerawork and fun musical performances and acts from Taylor Swift. I am not a fan of Taylor Swift but growing up, I had enjoyed quite a few songs from her. Especially with her songs ""22, Bad Blood, Style, and Love Story"" I really liked. The production sets, colors, and the camerawork is insanely colorful and demonstrates the big energy and atmosphere presented. I did enjoy that the concert had some creative moments with its structures as the sets, dancers, melody and tone were like telling a form of theme and narrative.Since I haven't been following Swift's recent works, many of the new songs were a mix of some I really liked listening to and some I didn't really like much. Though some of her older songs have brought some nostalgic vibes back. The sound mixing from the audio and music is amazing to which it helps create if you are at the concert. The dancers all provide good energy and feel to the environment though admittedly some of the dancers movements and expressions were slightly cringey at times.Overall, it's a good concert movie that fans will enjoy and good for music lovers to have some fun.~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 14 October 2023"

However, this one isn't one. i like many types of movies and this is one of them. a purely fun and colorful take on things. enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it! not all movies need that. it is great for kids and adults if you look at it as being simply fun! i am well over 21 and liked it very much!~sb-487-173392 rated 7/10 on 25 February 2017"," My son loved it...its a kid's movie!: After seeing so many negative ""trolls"" on here about what people don't like about this film, I thought I would just throw one glaring fact out there...it's a movie for kids! And my 2.5 year old loved it! As far as he is concerned, it currently has infinite replay value. He really seems to like movies that have a great sound track...which this one does. The songs are enjoyable covers of easily recognizable pop songs from several decades, with some modified lyrics. The point is, if a film entertains your kid many times over, then the writers did something right. The plot was simple and was about what I expected. If you really hated this movie, stop being such a Bergen and lighten up!~kdbtd rated NA on 20 February 2017"," Love the positive vibes and creative, colorful animation! Instant good mood!: I'm a 30 year old man, so probably not what the producers envisioned as their primary market, but I still love this movie!Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR! I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent. I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!~gtylerpayne rated 9/10 on 6 January 2017"," Entertaining enough kids' feature: My fiance made me watch this one and to my surprise it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It provided a bit of entertainment and featured some funny moments within its running time. We would later watch The Emoji Movie and that would be as bad as I thought it was going to be and she did not care for that one either. This one though managed to create funny and entertaining characters considering this thing was likely made to just to create more toys for the kids to go out and buy as the trolls here looked like more detailed trolls than the ones released sometime in the late 80's early 90's. The story has these creatures called Bergens basically eating the trolls because it is the only way they can be happy as trolls are singing and happy creatures in this film. The leader of the trolls though devises an escape and they end up forming their own town outside the realm of the Bergens. The cook of the Bergens gets the blame and is expelled from the city and life goes on peacefully for the trolls, that is, until the trolls throw a really big celebration that catches the eyes of a certain cook who is then able to capture some trolls and take them into the home of the Bergens to get back into the good graces of the new king. It is up to the super positive Poppy and the really negative Branch to infiltrate the town of the Bergens and rescue their captured friends. It had some really good music in this one and I liked the character of Poppy and the one Bergen who helped Poppy out, Bridget. I found it humorous when they started doing one of those music montages when they were giving Bridget a makeover and it gets cut short because Branch is not singing.So I enjoyed this film a bit, the only reason I did not rank it higher, I am not the biggest fan of computer generated films. I prefer live action films and my favorite animation type is anime. Not to say I don't like them all, just not my favorite media, though I am definitely in the minority because a lot of these films do so incredibly well including some that just seem so mediocre. This one is enjoyable enough, but I think it was because of Poppy's incredibly positive attitude even as she is being wrapped up by a spider and passing out that won me over.~Aaron1375 rated 7/10 on 12 September 2018"," Fun for what it is: This is a fun little silly kids movie. And it works really good. Again do not set any high bar or standard, just accept this for the animated fun that it is. And you don't even have to be a kid to enjoy it. There is enough for everyone. You shouldn't mind singing too much, though the songs are also very free and with Justin Timberlake at the helm you know you got a hit in the making.I actually knew one song before I had seen the movie. But that's just because it got very popular quickly. It may be the same for you. The story is simple and I wouldn't even really spoil anything, especially because it is very predictable. Just sit back and enjoy if you can and are willing too~kosmasp rated 7/10 on 17 June 2017"," Kids will eat it up, Grownups have seen it one too many times: I took my 5 1/2 year old daughter to watch Trolls, and for her it was a sight for sore eyes. The main character, Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a fluffy, instantly lovable princess troll, who has been raised in a careless, yet slightly obnoxious, world - where everyone hugs each other on an hourly basis, poops cupcakes and bursts into sappy pop tunes in the blink of the eye. Her male counterpart, on the other hand, is all doom and gloom. This troll party pooper, named Branch and colored gray to differentiate him from the endlessly colorful group of merry trolls, keeps warning his friends that their loud lifestyle will put their lives in jeopardy, once the evil Bergens, who are only happy when they eat the tiny little Trolls, will take notice of them. Sure enough, this does happen pretty soon into the movie, and when several Trolls are taken - Poppy and Branch (who refuses to sing throughout the film, even though he is ironically voiced by Justin Timberlake) need to join forces in order to save them.All in all, Trolls is a very cute film. It stands out of the pack with its familiar setting (the Troll toys have been very popular ever since the early 90's), its rich palette of colors and imaginative drawings, and the catchy tunes which are cleverly adapted into the film. Also, its short run-time will make sure your kids are glues to the chair. On the flip side, I felt the plot didn't really offer anything new, the proceedings were predictable from miles away, and that it lacked a stronger emotional pull that could have left a longer impression. There was some stuff in the movie that seemed like it was trying a bit too hard to be tongue-in- cheek, without really taking itself seriously, and while it gave way to a few laughs, it left me wanting something more than just another cute animated feature.~saarvardi rated 7/10 on 16 October 2016"," Brings Back Memories To The 1980's Saturday Morning Cartoons: Back in the 1950's an artist from Belgium named Peyo created those lovable blue-faced whimsical little creatures named The Smurfs. By the 1960's, a Danish woodcarver named Thomas Dam built a wooden doll for his young daughter, which like the Smurfs, would become a cultural icon better known as The Trolls. These cute little peculiar critters with their over-the-top pointy colourful hair have become one of the most popular toys in the 1960's and continued to have exceptional fame in the 1970's and again in the 1990's. It should come as no surprise that these iconic toys would be spawned into a full-length animated feature that inspires you to yearn for Saturday morning cartoons to come back so I can enjoy them with some sugary cereal.In their first animated feature (hopefully not their last) we see these cute little trolls, whose purpose in life is to be happy and spend their days dancing, hugging and singing jovial songs. It truly shows that the animators have taken this film by heart as they made the characters possess a softer, plushy skin complexion as opposed to the hard-plastic I remembered during the 1990's. It was also clever that the animators gave them generic clothing partially because naked trolls would not sit well the sensitive viewers. With the vibrant colours, the spontaneous musical numbers, the caressing and hugging, this will surely attract the younger audience, the adult with the inner child nostalgic for those 1980's cartoons or just anyone having a good time at the movies.Even though their village is permanently marked with glitter and happiness, they are an easy target to a group of unhappy goons known as the Bergens. They believe that the only way they can achieve happiness is if they must eat a Troll at a festival called Trollstice. As Bergen leader Prince Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is about to indulge in some delightful Troll happiness, the Trolls rebel by evacuating from their homes. Twenty years later, the village of Bergen Town is equally wallowing in misery while the Trolls are in preparation to one of the biggest parties since their escape under the watchful eye of the most ecstatic and whimsical of the Trolls Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick) not letting anything get in away even from the very pessimistic warnings from the gloomiest of the Trolls, Branch (Justin Timberlake). Their partying catches the attention from a witch-like Bergen named Chef (Christine Baranski) who ends up kidnapping them which lead to Poppy and Branch to go on a rescue mission.What makes this film truly stand out is that it works on plenty of nifty creative ways in its storytelling all the while succeeding in keeping the kids entertained for the next 90 minutes. It was cool that they juxtaposed classic songs like Funky Town and September and doctored it with rap remixes. Even the Bergens get some fun out of the music like Gorillaz' ""Sunshine in a Bag"" and Lionel Richie's ""Hello"". We do some fairy tale subplot involving Bergen scullery maid named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) who is head-over-heels with Prince Gristle. Rounding out the impressive cast is John Cleese as the Bergen King was a pleasure as always and Russell Brand as hipster like Troll named Creek who later becomes a traitor to them.Sure the message is that happiness is not an outer beauty but an inner beauty is simple, it succeeds without falling victim of being preachy or rubbing it in our faces. And surely enough if you have kids they will have a ball with this movie and the adults will surely recall a time when watching cartoons as kids is truly a sign of our childhood innocence that will remain in our memories forever.~eric262003 rated 9/10 on 25 June 2017"," A cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure you will definitely enjoy!: At first I had pretty low expectations for this film because of its first teaser, but then the first full length trailer made me look forward to it, and now that I've seen it, I have to say, you will enjoy this once you see it. It's very vibrant and filled with colour, which makes for a bright and exciting time, the trolls themselves are all really cute and colorful, and they are usually really funny in a situation and they are always positive and full of hope. It has a very well thought storyline, even if it does sound a bit generic at first, but it feels new and so fresh and original when you see it. And there is a lot of signing and dancing, and a lot of musical cues, and the songs really do get to you, as they are very catchy. And at times this film is very heartwarming, and a bit emotional at places, but that's sort of what you'd expect from a film like this. So overall, definitely see this one, as it is a cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure that the whole family will enjoy!~PeterJasonQuill rated 10/10 on 15 October 2016"," Colourful and upbeat confection that will especially delight the younger crowd: Despite loving or really liking a good deal of DreamWorks' previous work, especially 'The Prince of Egypt' (for me their best to date and one of my favourite films, animated and ever) and 'How to Train Your Dragon' (also a favourite), expectations were low for 'Trolls'.That is partly because although there are some very good to outstanding DreamWorks films, there have been underwhelming efforts too like 'Shark Tale', 'Bee Movie' and 'Home', even thought the last two 'Shrek' films and 'Penguins of Madagascar' could have been better than they turned out. A larger part however was that the teaser looked dreadful and the first trailer only marginally better, so was expecting a bad film and very much a lesser effort.What a surprise. 'Trolls' is yet another classic victim of bad and misleading advertising/marketing, and it is a shame as for me it is one of DreamWorks' past decade or so efforts along with 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' and 'Kung Fu Panda 2'. That said, it is understandable as to why some will still not like it or find it entirely appealing to them. It is somewhat younger-crowd oriented, so older children and adults may find, and have found, it too cute, too hyper-active and too cloying for their tastebuds.As a young adult myself with there was a lot to like, with the colours, the music, the characters, energy and overall atmosphere more than compensating and almost masking a story that narratively and structurally is not really all that special. There isn't really anything new as such conceptually and not a lot done in bringing freshness to it, while the magical hair subplot did feel shoe-horned in and as a result of not being elaborated upon quite enough it doesn't make as much sense as it ought to have done.On the other hand, the animation is brilliant. There is so much imaginative detail, the characters are well modelled, the backgrounds meticulous and best of all the colours are gorgeously vibrant and leap out at you from the screen. The soundtrack is like a musical extravaganza, and an upbeat and infectious one that has a huge presence in the film without being overkill. The script is enough fun and wit to counter-balance the cuteness and sugar, and neither of these elements felt over-balanced personally but that is not going to be an opinion shared by everybody.Story-wise, that is where 'Trolls' is least successful. However the energy is exuberant, and personally just couldn't fail to be captivated by the energy, feel-good nature and charm that the film had, even if narratively it's not that strong the atmosphere certainly was. The characters were pretty adorable, none of them were annoying and none on the wrong side of sickly sweet. The voice acting all round is adept, and the singing showing the vocalists attacking the music with gusto and love of music.On the whole, colourful and upbeat confection that may be too cute and sugary for older audiences, though there will definitely be exceptions (being one), but will especially delight the younger crowd. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 23 October 2016"," A Bombardment of Pure Joy and Happiness: I don't know what's wrong with those people who gave this movie a rating below 7, but they definitely need professional help. Cause if you don't feel that this movie is great, then there must be something really broken inside you! This movie gave us nothing but beautiful music, great adventures, hilarious comedy, with a little hint of fairy tale inserted (Hello, Cinderella!). It also gave us a strong moral lesson, which is to never give up hope in any kind of bad situation. It also tell us to be brave, kind, and always try to see the bright side in everything. How can it be called anything except amazing? I'm a guy, but I'm deeply touched when I saw Poppy's sadness killing her happiness, turning her whole body grey but then Branch started healing her and reviving her colors back. I have to admit I cried when I witnessed that heartwarming event. The songs which were picked for this movie is spot on! Each and every one of them brushed this movie with joy, thrill, and spirit. This animation movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. If you want to feel happy, then you definitely need to watch this movie.~cahidi rated 9/10 on 11 February 2017"
Tár (2022) - IMDb,7.4,Cate Blanchett|Noémie Merlant|Nina Hoss|Sophie Kauer|Adam Gopnik|Marc-Martin Straub|Egon Brandstetter|Ylva Pollak|Paula Först|Sylvia Flote|Sydney Lemmon|Mark Strong|Nicolas Hopchet|Zethphan D. Smith-Gneist|Kitty Watson|Alec Baldwin|Jessica Hansen|Mila Bogojevic,Todd Field,Todd Field,"Set in the international world of Western classical music, the film centers on Lydia Tár, widely considered one of the greatest living composer-conductors and the very first female director of a major German orchestra."," tar: It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".Thing is, though, that a lot of this film does approach, if not encroach upon, masterpiece territory. Certain scenes, like Lydia Tar's bleak Staten Island homecoming where she summons the spirit of her mentor Leonard Bernstein in an effort to recapture the humanistic values she has lost, are genuinely heartbreaking. And the sequences that deal with Lydia's manipulation of her acolytes are difficult to watch as we see how artistic power feels even more corruptible, somehow, than the political kind, perhaps because it is a profanation of a purer space.And I think we can all agree that Cate Blanchett is one helluva fine actor! As are Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant and Sophie Kauer who play various of her entourage/victims.Bottom line: For all its faults I have a sneaking suspicion that in twenty years they'll be watching this and not ""The Fabelmans"". Give it a B plus.~mossgrymk rated 8/10 on 27 December 2022"," All Hail Queen Blanchett: I believe that people in positions of authority should be held accountable for their actions. I believe that terrible people can make miraculous art. I believe that people studying an art form have an obligation to understand and engage with the full history of that art form, even when it's made by people who identify very differently from them. I believe that 99% of people accused of misdeeds are guilty to some extent of those misdeeds. I believe that there are many people who seek to avoid engaging with complex ideas and perspectives that challenge them and make them uncomfortable. I believe that everyone is guilty at times of making sweeping generalizations about others. I believe that there are positive things we can learn from people who might be terrible in other ways. I believe that both people participating voluntarily in a transactional relationship bear responsibility for the outcomes of that relationship. I believe that people are incredibly complex and can be many things at once. I believe we live in a social media world that more and more doesn't want to acknowledge that and wants to be able to smack an easy meme and label on everything.What does ""Tar"" -- the movie, not the character -- believe? Maybe all of the above. Maybe none of the above. The beauty of ""Tar"" is that it raises a host of complex questions but doesn't force any answers on the viewer. This is a movie made for adults that lets us think for ourselves. A lot of people are interpreting it as an examination of cancel culture. I can see why, though that isn't how I primarily interpreted it. I don't think it's as much about the rights and wrongs of cancel culture as much as it's about our complicated relationships with artists and the art they create. The movie isn't exclusively about Americans, but the writer and director Todd Field is, so I think it's also about how the only thing Americans enjoy more than turning someone into an unrealistic hero is to rip them apart when they fail to live up to our expectations.This is a movie I cannot stop thinking about. I didn't love it, though I liked it a lot. There's something slightly cold about it, so while I enjoyed the intellectual rigors of it, I didn't feel very emotionally involved. I started to feel its length as it moved into its final scenes. But I can't think of a movie I've seen recently that makes me want to talk to someone about it as much as this one, and that's got to be worth something.Nothing needs to be said about Cate Blanchett other than that she is magnificent.Grade: A.~evanston_dad rated 9/10 on 25 October 2022"," It's absolutely brilliant ONCE you know how the film ""works."": Initially I was put off by Tár-it's cryptic, drab, and sluggish. Until I realized what the filmmakers were actually accomplishing. No spoilers in this review, but to enjoy the film you have to know certain things:1. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic and rightfully deserves the accolades.2. The film is the slowest of slow burns.3. The film does not hold your hand.4. The film's narrative cuts out key elements of scenes that other filmmakers would have highlighted. This was the sticking point for me-it didn't dawn on me until halfway through the film what was happening. If you know this going in, I believe you'll have a better experience with the film. The film purposefully *doesn't* show you the ""important"" elements of scenes or relationships between characters. You have to figure that out yourself, just like putting together the puzzle of who Lydia Tár actually is. Here's a quick non-related example:Bill stared at the smoke in the frying pan.Bill rubbed his nose five times and took a call from Ernest while sipping coffee at Station 271.If those two sentences above were in a book, it would be leaving out major plot points that other authors would have filled in. First, there was a fire in Bill's kitchen. He called the fire department. He had to evacuate, so the fire may have been bad. And who is Ernest, if we have not been introduced to that character before? Why is bill rubbing his nose so much? Is it a tick or OCD or nervous habit?That's what Tár is like. It presents to you all the items ""between the lines"" and lets you solve for X for yourself. Once I understood that that was the dominant cinematic approach in this film, it became immensely more enjoyable...and challenging. Very much worth your time if you put in the effort.~Daviteo rated 8/10 on 27 February 2023"," the right note ... for a specific audience: Greetings again from the darkness. I seriously doubt that I'll ever skip a Cate Blanchett movie. She's won two Oscars and has been nominated six times. She's consistently the best part of her movies, and often the best in a full year of movies. Here she stars in the first film in 16 years from the remarkable writer-director Todd Field. His two previous films, LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) and IN THE BEDROOM (2001) combined for eight Oscar nominations, and more importantly, established Mr. Field as a rare and unique filmmaker of great depth. Having Field reappear and cast Blanchett generated a heap of excitement from this film nerd.Ms. Blanchett stars as Lydia Tar, a piano virtuoso, the conductor of the famed Berlin Orchestra, and a true musical genius. She's a rare EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) from the classical field. Her music (and her life) is a quest to uncover/discover what the composer meant with each piece. Lydia is sometimes rough on her wife Sharon (Nina Hoss), but frequently dotes on their young daughter ... while otherwise living a relative selfish and self-centered life. We also see this true persona in how she treats her young assistant Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who quietly aspires to become a conductor, while efficiently keeping Lydia on track each day.The film begins with ""New Yorker"" writer Adam Gopnik interviewing Lydia as a stage presentation in front of a live audience. It's his introduction of the Maestra where we learn her background and the proficiency that has garnered her such respect (as well as jealousy and animosity). Throughout the film, many real musicians (past and present) are referenced, and that detailed research is alone enough to earn respect for what Mr. Field has accomplished here. The stress and laser-focus on Lydia as she prepares for the final symphony in her Mahler portfolio (his 5th). We witness the meticulous detail that goes into managing the music and musicians, and this leads to handling the dismissal of veteran who is slipping, and the addition of a brilliant young cellist named Olga (Sophie Kauer). We are never quite sure if Lydia's attraction to Olga is limited to her skills with the bow.Of course, any perfectionist at the top of their industry is subject to backlash and criticism. Is Lydia abusive? Is she exploitive? It seems the answers may be affirmative, and likely what drives her art. It's quite discomforting to watch as she covers her tracks after the suicide of a former pupil, but I'll admit to a certain feeling of satisfaction as she verbally spars with another student over gender semantics ... actions that of course come back to bite her.Ms. Blanchett is fascinating and mesmerizing to watch. She is at the top of her game playing a perfectionist who is at the top of her game. However, it's clear this film isn't likely to strike the right notes with mainstream audiences. It's an arthouse film about art, and thus is filled with dialogue and much less actual music than you might expect for a film about a world class Orchestra conductor.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.~ferguson-6 rated 8/10 on 20 October 2022"," great performances, weak storytelling: Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.There's a strong establishing scene showing Tár demolishing an aspiring musician's conceited views on Bach, yet one has to wait for a long time for a follow-up showing the main character's boundary issues. The central topic emerges rather quickly (abuse of power), but there are diversions which support character development, yet drag on the narrative, which is probably why many reviews here find the film frustrating.Being an ex-Berliner, I like the fact that the city is being used as a real location as opposed to the usual tourist / Cold War hot spots, and the Philharmonics rehearsal scenes are very well done, but they don't really push the story forward and could have easily been wound down a bit.Nina Hoss as Tár's partner is a brilliant counterpoint, because she keeps a good deal of her thoughts to herself until she doesn't, so more focus on their relationship would have helped the story. Hoss would deserve a supporting actress Academy Award nod if only she had more screen time.The initial scene of conflict eventually loops back into focus, and Field could have used this to explore societal misjudgment as he did in ""Little Children"" - but he doesn't, which makes ""Tár"" rather distant and cold. Field expects viewers to interpret a lot on their own, which is bold and demanding, but with this approach it is crucial to keep focus on an underlying message, otherwise it gets lost.In conclusion, ""Tár"" has all the ingredients for a masterpiece - interesting characters, great performances, nice camerawork - but weak storytelling ultimately reduces the film's potential.~Radu_A rated 6/10 on 4 December 2022"," Powerful stuff. Blanchett is incredible.: Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.~garethcrook rated 7/10 on 1 February 2023"," Tar de Force: How much you enjoy Tar will depend largely on how you feel about a film that begins with the credits. There's good reason for it (everything in Tar is considered down to the smallest detail) but if you can't get on board with that kind of self indulgence then you are in for a long two and a half hours.One of the reasons for beginning with the credits may be that we are about witness a career in reverse. An opening interview lets us know that Lydia Tar is at the top of her profession, a conductor with a dream resume and an EGOT who is about to complete her masterpiece symphony recording. Over the next couple of hours we see her slipping down the mountain as past deeds and the way she treats people in general come back to take a bite out of her perfect life.The film solely follows Kate Blanchett's Tar for the entire runtime, we see all events from her perspective and she is in every scene. Blanchett put its an astounding performance, indeed it is hard to imagine many, if any, other actors who could have been up to the task. That the whole show rests on such a powerful but subtle turn is Tar's greatest strength but also its only real weakness. Its a nuanced performance that fits perfectly but added to the characters flawed nature it can at times leave proceedings feeling cold and hard to connect with emotionally. Like its titular character Tar is a film of craftmanship and intellect not emotion, although the themes of hierarchy dynamics and abuse are powerful.If you can get on board with the full force filmaking style then you will find Tar a breathtaking wonder of a movie with something to think about in every scene and something to ponder long after the (second lot of) credits roll.9 successful recordings out of 10 symphonies.~danchilton-71955 rated 9/10 on 1 February 2023"," Cate should be nominated for an Oscar; it's that good.: ""I am Petra's father...I am going to get you."" Lydia Tar (Cate Blanchett)Make no mistake, Tar is not about music: It is a fiction about naked power in the rarefied world of classical music conducting. As writer director Todd Field deftly orchestrates a drama that's almost a thriller about the first female conductor, Lydia Tar, in a major German orchestra, the audience is thrilled and mesmerized as if Leonard Bernstein (her mentor) were conducting Mahler in Lincoln Center.Cate Blanchett brilliantly becomes Tar, a world-renowned conductor, who has had stints from Cleveland to New York and finally Berlin. Blanchett is great enough to make the audience feel as if they had been intimate roommates with the maestro.No longer having to answer questions about gender, she commands with like a dictator from choosing orchestral leaders to changing a program to feature a potential lover soloing Elgar on a decidedly-different program dedicated to Mahler.When she dresses down a student at her Julliard lecture, she also handily deconstructs Bach's Prelude in C Major. She reveals in one incident her shredding personal side and her transcendent understanding of classical music.As the quote above displays, even in her personal life she exercises an outsized fearsomeness. She can dispatch her daughter's (Mila Bogojevic) bully with a force equivalent to conducting Mahler's Fifth (or ""the five"" as Lydia comfortably refers to it).When she asks permission from the orchestra to mount the Elgar, she is actually telling them that's what the program will be, at the same time informing them she's had to rotate out a beloved long-time player. Everyone is aware of the politics, especially her lust for a new cellist specializing in Elgar's Cello Concerto, replacing her assistant, Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who has seniority and maybe better skills. Yet Field, clearly schooled in Greek tragedy, loads the screenplay with hubris, the poison of numerous power players over the centuries.It's the conductor's old game in new times when social media will reveal peccadillos as well as crimes, real or figurative, and autocrats like James Levine and Lydia Tar cannot withstand the scrutiny.Because we have lived through all kinds of strong-man rule, from democracy-endangering fascism to indiscriminate pandemic, unfettered power seems eventually doomed to the moral demands of a populace chafing at the abuse of leadership for its personal gain, be it wealth or lust. It just takes a while for Nemesis to arrive.Tar may be the best film so far of 2022 and Blanchett the best actress. Start your Oscar adventure now in theaters with Tar.~JohnDeSando rated NA on 19 October 2022"," A Great Performance Doesn't Necessarily a Story Make -- Too Many Loose Ends: Spoiler Alert: This is more of a critique.I found this film frustrating to say the least. Yes, Blanchett's performance is mesmerizing but her character, Lydia Tar, doesn't have many redeeming qualities outside of her musicianship. But that's only part of the problem. This story if story it can be called centers on Lydia who seems to have everything a classical music artist could desire. But she ends up in scenes where I thought it was Tar in Unwonderland and we were losing the gist of the story.The opening scene is an interview with Lydia in which nearly half the interview was listing her awards. (The opening credits were longer than many scenes!) She's won every award imaginable from an Oscar to a Grammy to Best Guest on Sesame Street. (Just kidding about the last one, but the list is long.)This presents a problem as it seems from the get-go, the character can only go down. And incredibly unrealistic. (Btw not even Leonard Bernstein had achieved the so-called ""EGOT"", Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards. He was nominated for the Academy Award once but didn't win.) I could have bought she had won two of the four and striving for the other two. But all four seemed much. But again, this is only the beginning of the problems I had with this film.Just as things seemed to be too mundane for their own good, she has lunch with a fellow conductor where they talk classical music like inside baseball. I'm a classical musician and I knew what they were discussing, but would an average audience? And the discussion didn't seem to propel the story at all.Then there's a blood-bath scene in which she puts a young conducting student at Julliard in his place. Yes when I was a music student at the undergraduate level I had seen such confrontations, and I was even the target of a couple of such episodes. But my issue was the whole scenario was never really further developed except for someone having secretly video-taped the class session. The video is doctored and used as evidence against her later in the film but to what end. It's never quite explained. We someone with a camera video-taping Lydia at different events but we never find out who she was or her motives. I wondered if it was Krista.Then the story seemed to pick up when we meet a young cellist, Olga, who is being considered for the orchestra in Berlin, the orchestra where Lydia is the music director and main conductor. Lydia sees a video of the cellist playing her heart out performing the Elgar Cello Concerto, one of the great concertos in my humble opinion. Turns out the performance was when she was 13, and we assume she's probably now about 25. Highly unusual for a cellist to be that accomplished at such a young age, but I was willing to run with it.Lydia proposes to have her orchestra perform the Elgar Cello Concerto and we immediately realize she wants Olga to be the soloist rather than the first chair cellist who's probably been there for many years. Using her ability to get what she wants while making it seem ""egalitarian"" she holds auditions. The story seemed to be on its way to be about the conflict between her lesbian lover, the first chair cellist, and the orchestra itself which is now murmuring behind Lydia's back.As a side story, there's a young musician, Krista, who has committed suicide and it appears Lydia had some kind of relationship with her. There are emails from her both on her computer and her assistant's where she says things like there's nothing to live for. An investigation begins into her death. But that's another one of the loose threads which is never explained or resolved.Then the story takes some further strange turns which seem to make no sense and not relate to the main plot of the story. Lydia hears strange sounds, often while sleeping. She often gets up in the middle of the night and looks into the refrigerator. At one point she hears a metronome which is accidentally turned on in the middle of the night.She has an adopted daughter she cares for with her lesibian ""wife""/ There are a few scenes with her but eventually she is taken from her. An interesting character but I thought a distraction. She even gets lost in some slum housing where she thinks Olga the cellist resides and is attacked but we don't see who or what attacked her!Olga accompanies Lydia to New York, but even here I was confused that they were together. (We don't see Olga on the plane.) However, after they return, the story of the cellist seems to disappear from the movie altogether. Her lesbian lover accuses her of having an affair with Olga but they don't communicate. This is further not resolved except I guess we as the audience assume they've broken up.Regarding Krista, Lydia is accused of impropriety and her assistant quits. Then the authorities want the emails from the late Krista. Because of questions about Lydia's behavior, she's fired from the orchestra, or at least we gather. It's never fully explained.The whole thing climaxes with the most bizarre scene of the entire film, which exiles her from the classical music world of Europe. Even a power-hungry conductor would know that such behavior is a career-ending faux pas. And the film ends with her in another country in a gig which has the importance of about 1% of her gig in Berlin.But the loose ends were too loose and unresolved and I felt ultimately dissatisfied with the ending. We never quite understand what had happened with Lydia and Krista. We never see the cellist perform the Elgar. We aren't even quite told what happens to Lydia's lesbian lover. Her final gig is a kind of a what? Which is how I started to feel throughout the last half of the film, It went from boring to interesting, maybe potential, to too bizarre for its own good.~classicalsteve rated 4/10 on 4 March 2023"," How can a first hour seem like a year?: Director Todd Field is undeniably up to something different with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is he's actually up to, what his goal is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very. And another thing for sure, it don't work.Proof?The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.~levybob rated 5/10 on 22 October 2022"

Injecting some much needed energy into their repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition."," Turn off your brain and just enjoy....: The most important thing you might wanna know about this review is that I am certainly NOT in the target demographic group for this film. As a 53 year-old man, I am not the type to ever watch ""Pitch Perfect"" in the first place and did so only because my daughter insisted that it was a good film and I would enjoy it. And, fortunately, I did enjoy it quite a bit. Now I am NOT saying I think it's a great film, it certainly has its faults, but it is fun and entertaining.The film is about a capella singing....certainly not the sort of thing most of us enjoy or even care about...though the film manages to infuse the subject with enthusiasm. And, you'll soon find yourself moving along with the singing...and much of it is very infectious. And, the film is about most every stereotype I could think of when it comes to young adult films---you have the bossy and nasty leader of the group, the lesbian, the fat girl who is funny and the rest of the clichés (such as the final big number where not only do ALL the ladies know the lyrics BUT also the choreography of a song they NEVER practiced). But, it manages to make it enjoyable because it SAYS that these are stereotypes at times and the music is pretty cool. I could have done without all the vomit, however. Overall, this is a very watchable and enjoyable picture.~planktonrules rated 7/10 on 18 June 2017"," Pitch Perfect: I knew this film was about singing, and I knew a couple of the female stars in it, as for everything else, I was looking forward to seeing this sleeper hit for myself. Basically, at the annual International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAC), at Lincoln Center in New York City, the Bellas, from Barden University, are the first all-female group to make it to the finals. But they cannot compete against the all-male Treblemakers, as they perform uninspired arrangements, outdated girl songs, and they are humiliated by Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomiting during her solo. Four months later, freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) is a new arrival at Barden. She has no desire to attend college, but her professor father (John Benjamin Hickey) has forced her, she wants to pursue a career as a DJ and music producer in Los Angeles. Beca spends her time making mash-ups and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). Beca's father finds out she has not been attending classes, so he makes a deal with her, if she joins a club and still wants to leave college after a year, he allow her to do so, and will pay her way to Los Angeles to pursue her career. Beca is persuaded by Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) to join to Barden Bellas, Aubrey initially disapproves, but she sees Beca has talent. Soon other members join, that do not fit the group's typical mould, including Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie Conrad (Alexis Knapp), Lilly Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee) and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Their rehearsals are shaky, but they slowly find harmonies and roles. The new Bellas lineup perform at the southeastern regional competition at Carolina University, but at Aubrey's insistence they perform the same medley they did at the finals the previous year. But the last of their three songs is a hit, and they get second place and progress to the semi-finals. But disaster strikes when the Treblemakers cause an uproar with the Bellas after the competition. Beca accidentally smashes a window with the trophy, she is arrested by the police. Jesse, who joined the Treblemakers, bails Beca out, but it gets worse when her father gets involved and tells her he will no longer pay for her to go to Los Angeles. Beca is infuriated and her friendship with Jesse is soured, and Aubrey will not listen to her suggestion for the Bellas to be more daring songs. At the semi-finals, during the Bellas' ""traditional"" performance, Beca provides an impromptu back-up of one of her favourite songs, the audience enjoy the remix, but the Bellas come third, behind the Footnotes and the Treblemakers. Aubrey is furious with Beca, who in turn quits. But things improve when the Footnotes are later disqualified from the national competition, because the lead singer was actually still in high school, meaning the Bellas can take part instead. The Bellas reform after spring break, without Beca, Chloe stands up to Aubrey for her stubbornness, and the group fall apart. Beca meanwhile is declined an apology from Jesse, so she returns to the Bellas, apologising for her actions at the semi-finals, and Aubrey eventually allows her a second chance. Having had a heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca's more modern and original music style. Meanwhile, Treblemakers group leader Bumper Allen (Adam Devine) leaves after being offered a job to be backup singer for John Mayer. Jesse convinces them to let his previously rejected roommate Benji Applebaum (Ben Platt) join the group. At the a cappella national competition, the Bellas, with Beca's arrangement, sing a modern song, plus a performance of ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesse's favourite movies, this acts as a more effective apology from Beca. Following the performance, Beca and Jesse kiss, the Bellas win the competition, and six months later, they audition for new members. Also starring Elizabeth Banks (also producing) as Gail Abernathy-McKadden, John Michael Higgins as John Smith, Alexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad, Ester Dean as Cynthia Rose, Hana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara, Kelley Alice Jakle as Jessica and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Tommy. Kendrick is likeable as the determined would-be DJ and new talent to the gang, Camp is convincingly annoying as the uptight soloist, and Wilson with her Australian accent and big screen presence gets many of the laughs being the loud eccentric one. It is a simple story, an a cappella girl group struggling get a new talent and improve dramatically, there are clichés and stereotypical characters, but the script is smart, the energy is razor-sharp, and the singing talent and soundtrack in splendid, it is a most enjoyable musical comedy. Good!~jboothmillard rated 6/10 on 9 July 2016"," It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...: That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even Bridesmaids. Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling as much.~somf rated 8/10 on 15 September 2012"," Geared up to hate this, but ended up loving it.: When my girlfriend suggested put this on I mimed blowing my brains out with an imaginary revolver.That was a mistake. This is a great, fun film!An all girl acapella group have to regain their crown by winning a competition.So a motley crew of underdogs is assembled, including our main character, to challenge the superior competition.The characters are heavily stereotyped, and this is the source of a lot of the comedy.I found the characters engaging and lovable, and laughed along with most of the gags.The cynical, misogynistic, judgemental, biased commentators were especially funny.The singing segments are short and sharp and just enough to get your foot tapping without going full blown Mary Poppins.I didn't expect (or particularly want) to enjoy this but I did a lot.My recommendation is that even if this is not your kind of movie force yourself to watch the first fifteen minutes, their is a good chance you will make it to the end with a smile on your face.~thekarmicnomad rated 8/10 on 4 January 2018"," This film wasn't meant for me: POSITIVES:1) The commentary duo at all the a Capella competitions were funny2) Some of the jokes worked3) The music occasionally sounded goodNEGATIVES:1) I was put on the back foot straight away because I thought the Bellas performing I Saw The Sign sounded great but then in the film it gets ridiculed.

Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur.

Recommended.~M0vieL0ver rated 7/10 on 20 July 2020," What ""Glee"" Wishes it Could Be.: ""Pitch Perfect"" is basically ""Bring It On"", but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, ""Pitch Perfect"" tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other ""a ca-losers""; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, ""Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, ""Pitch Perfect"" does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious ""Best in Show""-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, ""Pitch Perfect"", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments.""Pitch Perfect"" vs. ""Glee"": The main reason ""Pitch Perfect"" works so well is actually quite simple. Where ""Glee"" is so in love with its self-proclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new ""cool"", this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups, glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song, while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So, if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of ""Glee"" (or that awful show ""The Sing-Off"") but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways, no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what ""Pitch Perfect"" has to offer.Final Thought: Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side, this is still a PG-13 venture. In short, ""Pitch Perfect"" is not the raunchy female buddy comedy, filled with overlong skits about feces that ""Bridesmaids"" was. But good news""Pitch Perfect"" is so much more funny and (more importantly) more accessible than ""Bridesmaids"" will ever be. What I mean by ""accessible"" is, men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase: ""You wouldn't get it because you're a man."" All kidding aside, I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since ""Easy A"". So, in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012, filled with half-assed attempts such as ""That's My Boy"" and ""The Watch"", ""Pitch Perfect"" is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year, but also the funniest movie of the year (so far); narrowly edging out ""21 Jump Street"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing.

Also starring Elizabeth Banks (also producing) as Gail Abernathy-McKadden, John Michael Higgins as John Smith, Alexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad, Ester Dean as Cynthia Rose, Hana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara, Kelley Alice Jakle as Jessica and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Tommy. Kendrick is likeable as the determined would-be DJ and new talent to the gang, Camp is convincingly annoying as the uptight soloist, and Wilson with her Australian accent and big screen presence gets many of the laughs being the loud eccentric one. It is a simple story, an a cappella girl group struggling get a new talent and improve dramatically, there are clichés and stereotypical characters, but the script is smart, the energy is razor-sharp, and the singing talent and soundtrack in splendid, it is a most enjoyable musical comedy. Good!~jboothmillard rated 6/10 on 9 July 2016"," It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...: That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even Bridesmaids. Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling as much.~somf rated 8/10 on 15 September 2012"," Geared up to hate this, but ended up loving it.: When my girlfriend suggested put this on I mimed blowing my brains out with an imaginary revolver.That was a mistake. This is a great, fun film!An all girl acapella group have to regain their crown by winning a competition.So a motley crew of underdogs is assembled, including our main character, to challenge the superior competition.The characters are heavily stereotyped, and this is the source of a lot of the comedy.I found the characters engaging and lovable, and laughed along with most of the gags.The cynical, misogynistic, judgemental, biased commentators were especially funny.The singing segments are short and sharp and just enough to get your foot tapping without going full blown Mary Poppins.I didn't expect (or particularly want) to enjoy this but I did a lot.My recommendation is that even if this is not your kind of movie force yourself to watch the first fifteen minutes, their is a good chance you will make it to the end with a smile on your face.~thekarmicnomad rated 8/10 on 4 January 2018"," This film wasn't meant for me: POSITIVES:1) The commentary duo at all the a Capella competitions were funny2) Some of the jokes worked3) The music occasionally sounded goodNEGATIVES:1) I was put on the back foot straight away because I thought the Bellas performing I Saw The Sign sounded great but then in the film it gets ridiculed. Then all the stuff that I think sounds terrible the film thinks is great2) It's yet another ""teen"" film that has absolutely no sense of what being in college is actually like3) It's nowhere near funny enough and some of the jokes are frankly appalling (what was going on with the projectile vomiting?!?!)~DanLawson146 rated 4/10 on 8 October 2020"," Watch out - you're going to like it whether you want to or not!: We two 50+ grandmas went to see this film on the spur of the moment because we enjoy musical movies. We were probably the oldest people in the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone, regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur. Fun, feel-good and highly entertaining.~penwah2 rated 9/10 on 5 October 2012", Sing: Pretty decent musical considering it was obviously low budget.

Recommended.~M0vieL0ver rated 7/10 on 20 July 2020," What ""Glee"" Wishes it Could Be.: ""Pitch Perfect"" is basically ""Bring It On"", but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, ""Pitch Perfect"" tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other ""a ca-losers""; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, ""Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, ""Pitch Perfect"" does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious ""Best in Show""-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, ""Pitch Perfect"", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments.""Pitch Perfect"" vs. ""Glee"": The main reason ""Pitch Perfect"" works so well is actually quite simple. Where ""Glee"" is so in love with its self-proclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new ""cool"", this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups, glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song, while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So, if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of ""Glee"" (or that awful show ""The Sing-Off"") but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways, no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what ""Pitch Perfect"" has to offer.Final Thought: Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side, this is still a PG-13 venture. In short, ""Pitch Perfect"" is not the raunchy female buddy comedy, filled with overlong skits about feces that ""Bridesmaids"" was. But good news""Pitch Perfect"" is so much more funny and (more importantly) more accessible than ""Bridesmaids"" will ever be. What I mean by ""accessible"" is, men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase: ""You wouldn't get it because you're a man."" All kidding aside, I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since ""Easy A"". So, in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012, filled with half-assed attempts such as ""That's My Boy"" and ""The Watch"", ""Pitch Perfect"" is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year, but also the funniest movie of the year (so far); narrowly edging out ""21 Jump Street"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus~ghost_dog86 rated 9/10 on 7 October 2012"," Something Special: I didn't want to like it. Despite what you may think I don't want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.~rivertam26 rated 8/10 on 28 September 2012"
A Star Is Born (2018) - IMDb,7.6,Lady Gaga|Bradley Cooper|Sam Elliott|Greg Grunberg|Andrew Dice Clay|Rafi Gavron|Anthony Ramos|Dave Chappelle|Alec Baldwin|Marlon Williams|Brandi Carlile|Ron Rifkin|Barry Shabaka Henley|Michael D. Roberts|Michael Harney|Rebecca Field|Derek Kevin Jones|Willam Belli,Bradley Cooper,Eric Roth|Bradley Cooper|Will Fetters,A musician helps a young singer find fame as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.," This was a good movie but not a great movie: This was a good movie but not a great movie (this will not be a popular opinion). First the good stuff: Lady Gaga was perfect for and in this role - acting singing, chemistry, song writing - all fantastic. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Gaga was believable and, at times, breathtaking. The first two thirds of the movie had a great arch and captured us (as a friend, who watched the movie with me, said, ""I could watch the first part of this movie on repeat."") I am also a big fan of about 5 of the songs, and would add them to my library without hesitation, they are beautifully written. Now, the not so good stuff: the last third of the movie was too long - it could easily be cut by 20 minutes, but Bradley Cooper, as director, was more than a little self indulgent with his own scenes (we got the struggle, drawing it out didn't serve the storytelling). Ally's character arch was disappointing. As her star rose she didn't learn to love what Jack saw in her. She didn't learn to take ownership of her own story, the very gift Jack was trying to give her. Ally's story wasn't resolved until the very last moments of the movie, it was eclipsed by Bradley's directorial obsession with Jack's decline, belying the original premise of all the STAR IS BORN movies and lessening her triumph. I guess what moved it from great to good, for me, was that the first two thirds proved it could be great but the last third got hijacked (no pun intended). I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Music-centric Romantic Drama}~nancyldraper rated 7/10 on 6 October 2018"," I Enjoyed It: I know some will say this is a manipulative film. Perhaps, to some extent. When Lady Gaga began performing, I couldn't stand her. My old fogieness caused me to find her pretentious and doing anything for attention. Over the last couple years I have grown to really enjoy what she does. At an advanced age, I would love to see her in concert. Being able to here her great range and depth in this movie was a very pleasant experience. Also, the chops of Bradley Cooper were quite amazing. We all know the plot. I've seen all but one of the previous incarnations, so the big picture stuff was no an issue. There were a few slow moments but I think it worked very well.~Hitchcoc rated 8/10 on 20 July 2019"," Starts in exhilarating fashion, although loses steam: It's a story as old as time, and that's evident in the fact that Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born is the fourth (yes, FOURTH) remake of the movie classic. However, with clearly passionate directing and acting throughout, furthered by wonderful music and an efficient portrayal of the classic rags-to-riches story, this proves a thoroughly entertaining and memorable watch that absolutely flies by over the course of nearly two and a half hours.But before we get into all that, I have to start with the film's opening half hour, which is exceptional. Despite its long running time, there's so much packed into the opening act, and it's delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-old story about finding fame in beautiful and riveting fashion.In fact, in the knowledge that it's a story that you know like the back of your hand, Cooper ingeniously ramps the dial up to eleven as we watch our young up-and-coming star caught up in an exhilarating whirlwind as she is suddenly transported from a small waitressing job to singing in front of thousands, culminating in a stunningly moving musical sequence that feels like a true epiphany, as you watch this young woman overwhelmed as she gets her first taste of stardom, something that I was absolutely blown away by.That opening half hour is truly exceptional. Full of emotion, drama and moving at a pace that mirrors the dramatic transformation from ordinary singer to superstar, it's exhilarating to watch at every moment, and easily the best opening act I've seen from a film this year, setting up the rest of the film fantastically.Rather unfortunately, however, things don't quite pan out in the same stunning fashion through the rest of the movie. While the remained of A Star Is Born is still good, I was left feeling a little disappointed that it couldn't keep up that same exhilarating energy and emotion from the first act, as things quieten down and become a little more predictable.Of course, there's nobody who doesn't know this story, so being predictable isn't as much of a problem, but what I found frustrating about the film was how it failed to keep delving deeper into the lives of the lead characters as their careers start flying in completely opposing directions.As a director, Cooper did an incredible job with the opening half hour, and his passion for the subject matter remains strong throughout, but the problem comes in the way that he portrays the main points of this age-old story in a rather plain fashion, moving a little too readily onto each new stage in the two singers' careers without leaving enough time for things to settle.In that, the film has a good pace to it that makes it a thoroughly entertaining watch right to the end, but with the exception of the opening act and the finale, there just isn't enough depth to the individuals here, leaving me a little detached from their emotions throughout the middle portion, and having to rely on my knowledge of the classic rags-to-riches story to understand more about what they were feeling.So, a little bit more clarity and patience would have gone a long way here, and I would have been genuinely happy to watch another half hour or so of the film.While the second two-thirds of the movie aren't so profoundly moving, that doesn't mean there's nothing to praise, because along with Cooper's passionate directing, we see two fantastic performances from the director himself as well as Lady Gaga.Starting off with Bradley Cooper, his portrayal of an aging and fading star is thoroughly fascinating to watch. While he doesn't appear as the story's main focus, the quality of his performance is such that I was at times even more invested in his character than the rise of the starlet, as he pulls off the maturity and likability of his battle-hardened character while still putting in a powerful portrayal of his deeper weaknesses, something that makes him both delightfully appealing and still deeply interesting to follow throughout.Alongside Cooper is Gaga, who is a real revelation here. Given that she's never been in a role of this magnitude before, her acting ability is truly stunning, and she gives a performance that's just as profound and striking as any experienced A-list actress. Taking from her own experience of life in the music business and her rise to stardom in real life, the passion that she feels for her character is clear in every scene, with that previously mentioned epiphany-inducing musical number 'Shallow' featuring the best example of her incredible acting.She holds fantastic chemistry with Cooper, and the two make their characters' relationship both convincing and genuinely appealing, even through the inevitable ups and downs of the story, keeping your interest strong as the film moves through the story towards the finish.In the end, I was very impressed with A Star Is Born. It's unfortunately not pitch-perfect all the way through, but after a mind-blowing opening act, and featuring passionate and likable directing and performances throughout, it proves a massively entertaining watch regardless, with some excellent music to boot.~themadmovieman rated 7/10 on 3 October 2018"," Another Great Remake: The storyline of ""A Star Is Born"" is great with the story of the rise of a new star and the fall of the old one, who is her beloved alcoholic man that discovered and promoted her career. This 2018 version and fourth famous remake has the excellent Bradley Cooper not only singing but also directing and a surprising Lady Gaga in the lead role. Sam Elliott completes the magnificent cast. In addition, great screenplay, music score, cinematography and edition that make this romance one of the favorites to the Oscar. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Nasce uma Estrela"" (""A Star Is Born"")~claudio_carvalho rated 8/10 on 3 February 2019"," A Star is BORED: I am more than just a bit surprised how many of the IMDB reviews just glow about this remake, of another remake, of another remake of yet still another remake. In case some people don't realize it, this film has been over cooked since the 1930's.Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliott's gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity (Cooper) even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star. While Jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests in front of the door resting alone and waiting for his master Jack to come out from behind the closed garage door. Awwwwww shucks. Cooper's screenplay denotes ""sappy sucker tears called for here"".I wish Hollywood would welcome some fresh new screenwriters blood with some really creative ideas for screenplays rather than just use bonafide stars to re-write old screenplays and re-hash old movies and expect us avid filmgoers who enjoy going to actual movie theaters to suck the old crap up again and again.I bet that more than half the people who wrote a praiseworthy IMDB review in 2018 for this film won't even remember who starred in this 5th version of A Star Is Born because it is simply not a memorable film, nor is it worthy of the bloated high praise it has been garnering. In reference to the great P.T. Barnum ""There's a Sucker Born Every Minute""...don't be the next one. Pass on this overrated remake.~Ed-Shullivan rated 4/10 on 8 October 2018"," The Lady Is A Star: This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born I've seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!~johngiovannicorda rated 8/10 on 28 October 2018"," A love story mixed with pain, addiction, fame, and tragedy.: Being a film buff I never watched the older takes of ""A Star is Born"" however I watched this latest modern spin with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga(who have great on screen chemistry together). The film is a joy as it touches your emotions and grows on you from the love of the two central characters and the pain combined with fame and sorrow make this musical drama(the songs are uplifting)a wonderful watch.Jackson Maine(Bradley Cooper) is a hard living and hard whiskey drinking western rock singer who lives it up entertaining crowd after crowd. Jackson is a man who's got plenty of personal demons besides the bottle as his family friction with only brother Bobby(the great Sam Elliott) weighs on his heart heavy. Things change when Ally(Lady Gaga) captures his heart along the way the two get to know each other in an intimate way as passion becomes love.Still the love is not without struggle and heartache as Ally becomes famous and well known while Jackson's music and personal life both take a downward path with alcoholism as he just can't escape his own dark shadows. It's like you as the viewer could see the tragedy coming all along.Overall entertaining film with fine and beautiful music and the on screen chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is in top notch form, as clearly this is one love drama to see that showcases the rise of fame and stardom, also while showing a grim personal downfall.~blanbrn rated 8/10 on 6 October 2018"," One star that really does shine: Had heard nothing but great things about this latest 'A Star is Born' film, with even my own sister saying it was a must see. There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my ""seeing as many 2018 films as possible"" quest.This is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching ""The Man That Got Away""), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and ""Evergreen"" is to die for.As far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.It's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.The final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.What 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.Visually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as ""The Man That Got Away"" and ""Evergreen"" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. ""I'll Never Love Again"" and ""Shallow"" stand out.Dialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.Altogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 18 October 2018"," A Star is Born Shines (TIFF 2018): If you're even a casual moviegoer, chances are you have already heard the argument; that originality is dead in Hollywood. We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldn't be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly don't capture the audience's hearts. They certainly don't capture the praise critics. They certainly don't take home any major awards.That all changes with A Star is Born.Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. (Or remakes of remakes of remakes...) In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. It's a delicate balance. Every version of a Star is Born follows a broken celebrity, in the Winter of his career, damaged by years of drinking who is suddenly reborn when meeting a young ingénue. The two fall in love, but while their relationship develops, their entertainment careers go in different directions.Director and Co-Star Bradley Cooper's film seemingly borrows more from the Streisand/Kristofferson iteration of A Star is Born (the last time this story was retold), as the dynamic between the two lovers hinges on the music industry. When Streisand and Kristofferson remade the film, (for the fourth time at that point) in 1976, they broke one of the aforementioned expectations, as they both took home Golden Globes for their performances. Perhaps Cooper was more inspired by performance, rather than aesthetic, as the acting is one aspect out of many that shines in Cooper's version. The characters of Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) drive the entire story in what is essentially a film with only half a dozen notable characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have amazing chemistry, and from the moment you see the two on screen together for the first time you feel the connection.First time director, Cooper, deftly creates intimacy between Jackson and Ally, without which the story would certainly not be as successful. In stadiums housing thousands of fans, in small dressing rooms packed with screaming Drag Queens, in a loud dive bar, in the parking lot of an all-night-grocer, Cooper uses tight framing and sound impeccably to make it seem like they're the only two people in the world. You understand his charm, you see her vulnerability, and the two actors give side-by-side stellar performances.That isn't to take away anything from a small, but powerful supporting cast. There were some brilliant and surprising moments from Dave Chappelle as Noodles, an old friend of Jackson's who reiterates how much Ally has revitalized Jackson. The largest surprise came from Andrew Dice Clay as Lorenzo, Ally's father. Both Clay and Chappelle brought great moments of love and humanity in their criminally small interactions with the two main characters. Sam Elliot also surprised me in his role as Bobby, Jackson's (much) older brother. They explain the age discrepancy, but the rest is self-explanatory as he and Cooper truly are brothers on screen, with all the frustration, fights and familiarity that goes with that relationship. Elliot in his similarly small time on screen, often showed the softer side of his craft, hiding touching instants of sadness when it comes to his difficult relationship with his brother, concealed only slightly by his iconic mustache.It begs the question, does Cooper deserve all the praise as director, or does the cast? What I can glean from the film is Cooper definitely had his cast on the same page, as regardless of screen time, these actors made you care about their characters. The audience is invested. There are countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating or angering. Instead of merely recognizing that these are hurdles to push the story further, I found myself almost vocally upset, akin to yelling at a character in a horror film to not go in the room where the killer is hiding. This film makes you want the protagonists to succeed, even when dealing with topical subplots regarding celebrity, regret, depression and substance abuse.And that's because you're along for the ride the entire time. You're a part of this love story. The film sucks you in from the beginning with the roar of a raucous concert audience, the hard beat of the drums on Jackson's stage, and his hypnotic swagger as he plays for thousands. If you were one of the millions of people who have seen the trailer for this film, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about (kudos to the promotional department of this film, as that, is an extremely engaging and powerful trailer) but it stems from an extremely engaging and powerful film. The music, much like it did with the trailer gets inside you, not just inside your head where you find yourself humming a gentle country lilt sang by Cooper, it gets inside your heart and soul and rattles around. It repeats over and over until you're the one who doesn't want to let go. While Cooper should be commended for taking his craft seriously and improving his singing, this is where Lady Gaga shines, to no one's surprise.Ally is a perfect role for her. The performer has spoken about how vulnerable and ugly she felt in some scenes when shooting this film, but it made her so real on screen. Ally's career, much like the first half of the film, blasts off, and all you can do is hold on until you realize the songstress is belting a powerful ballad. You wonder, much like her character ""how did we get here"" but at that point, you're just happy to be along for the ride. It is a testament to Lady Gaga's ability, because being such an iconic figure, if it weren't for her conveyance of sincerity and humility, the character's journey would seem forced and unfulfilling. Because of Gaga's performance, however, you relish the moment Ally can finally embrace who she is and bravely belt out her songs with no inhibition. In a film with so many moments that grab you, the music is undeniably one of my favorite aspects. I can't wait for this film to get a wider release so the studio can also make the soundtrack available.If and when Award season comes, and A Star is Born is undeniably a forerunner for several major awards, I think Cooper should be commended simply because as director, he brought everything together. The songwriters, the actors, the cinematography, the sound design was superbly balanced to create the best possible version of this story making it, the brightest star for both critics and audiences.~michaeljohnson-27597 rated 9/10 on 22 September 2018"," Gaga Steals the show...: This is the time of the year when Oscar worthy movies begin to come out and ""A Star is Born"" has definitely began the season and set the bar.I knew Bradley Cooper can act and he did a great job but Lady Gaga was the one to steal the show with a marvelous performance. The chemistry between the two of them was the driving factor for this beautiful film where so much happens and yet it never feels rushed or forced. The flow is just natural and filled with various emotions from sadness to humor, despair and anger.... As expected, the music is diverse and touching from both Gaga and Cooper who was a big surprise in this department. Overall a wonderful film that leaves a good afterthought after you exit the cinema.~arabnikita rated 10/10 on 11 October 2018"

As the situation worsens, he hides in the ruins of Warsaw in order to survive."," Excellent, depressing, but excellent: Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 1 November 2004"," A haunting film, one that you won't forget: I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10~baumer rated NA on 27 March 2003"," A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.: This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.~Fella_shibby rated 10/10 on 9 September 2013"," An astonishing film: The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly~FilmOtaku rated 8/10 on 28 April 2003"," To hell and back.: The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.~jotix100 rated 10/10 on 21 January 2003"," ""You musicians don't make good conspirators."": Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.~classicsoncall rated 10/10 on 3 February 2013"," Stoic, haunting tale of survival: The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+~Quinoa1984 rated 10/10 on 16 January 2003"," Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch: This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)~dtb rated 10/10 on 9 January 2004"," Definitively an inspiring epic...: 'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...~Nazi_Fighter_David rated 10/10 on 6 September 2005"," terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic: I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.~baba44713 rated 9/10 on 7 April 2005"

All of the reviews have come back positive saying this is the best opener since Whiplash. The performances are good all around. What got to me most is the family dynamic. It's something really heart-warming to watch that put a smile on my face the whole time. The comedy landed well throughout. The same goes for the drama. Sian Heder is a good director and we see the heart put into the movie. The story is where some of my issues came from. It follows a typical storyline that we've seen before in movies geared toward teens. It became predictable along the way and some of the scenes felt too good to be true. But I understand this isn't meant to be something to breakdown and analyze. All in all, this is meant to make us feel good and that's exactly what it did. I look forward to rewatching this again in the future.~sweidman-28016 rated 8/10 on 29 January 2021"," dream a little dream: Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.Emilia Jones (HIGH-RISE, 2015) stars as Ruby, and we first see her slinging fish on the boat with her father Frank (Troy Kutsor) and brother Leo (newcomer Daniel Durant). Ruby belts out songs while the two men handle their duties, unaware of the lovely melodies filling the air. At home, the dinner table conversation is handled through ASL (American Sign Language) with mom/wife Jackie (Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, 1986) leading the way.At school, Ruby is an outcast due to her clothes, the lingering aroma of fish, and her ""weird"" family. With a silent crush on Miles (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo from the excellent SING STREET, 2016), Ruby signs up for choir, but freezes during the audition. The choir director, Bernardo (roll the r's) Villalobos, is played energetically and colorfully by Eugenio Derbez (OVERBOARD, 2018), and he offers encouragement to Ruby - mostly because she has a beautiful singing voice. Bernardo explains how her singing voice offers a path to college, something she's never before considered due to family responsibilities.There is a lot going on in this film from writer-director Sian Heder (TALLULAH, 2016). It's obviously adapted from the 2014 French film LA FAMILLE BELIER, and plays as a mainstream crowd-pleaser, when it just as easily could have been a deep cut indie film. Ms. Heder's approach means a larger viewing audience, though there are elements we wish had been further explored. The teen romance never really clicks, and there are hints that Bernardo's story holds more levels than we get. However, the Rossi family dynamics are quite something to behold. Father Frank wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes those emotions are angry and bitter, while other times quite comical or even horny (for his wife). Brother Leo wants desperately to lead the family business towards prosperity. He has ideas for growth, but is frustrated being dependent on Ruby as a conduit to the community.Mother Jackie and Ruby have a typical mother-teenage daughter relationship. The mother wants status quo where the daughter remains an integral part of the family, while the daughter wants her mom to acknowledge the dreams for a different life - one that capitalizes on her talents. When Jackie questions her daughter on her singing, she does so in the most hurtful way possible (brilliant writing). And yet, when mom recounts Ruby's birth, the love is as clear as the disconnect ... and likely to draw a tear or two. Filmmaker Hader serves up numerous strong scenes, but two really stood out for this viewer. First, when Ruby is singing on stage, we ""hear"" what the parents hear, and their pride is obvious. The second occurs when dad asks Ruby to sing for him as they are perched on the backend of the car. It's phenomenal acting by Kutsor, and further clarifies a lifelong father-daughter bond ... and the first time he fully comprehends her talent. All four leads give strong performances, and it's a star-making performance from Ms. Jones (think a young Saoirse Ronan).Apple paid a record-breaking $25 million for the film's rights at Sundance, and the mainstream appeal of this family drama sprinkled with comedy and life messages is indisputable. So while my preference would have been more focus on the 'outsider' aspect of the Rossi family in the community, it's easy to see why this choice was made. It's an entertaining film that will likely land on many year-end ""Best"" lists. Maybe even mine.Streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13, 2021.~ferguson-6 rated 8/10 on 11 August 2021"," Best film I have seen this summer! (2021): This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters. This film really deserved the 10.~Horror_Flick_Fanatic rated 10/10 on 14 August 2021"," Heart-wrenchingly beautiful: There were two main attractions for me prior to seeing 'Coda'. One was the critical reception, with three Oscar wins and many other accolades (making it one of the best received films of the year). The other was the subject matter, have liked to loved many coming of age films and what interested me was that it was one that had deaf characters and ones portrayed by actors who are deaf in real life. Have always felt that deafness has not been represented anywhere enough in film or television (or at least to this extent), so that it was explored here was great.'Coda' for me was a heart wrenchingly beautiful film, one of the most emotional, most charming and most relatable films of 2021 and of a very up and down year that has seen a fair share of disappointments it is easily one of my favourites and one of the few Best Picture winners in a long time to deserve that honour. It is a remake, but it sure didn't feel like one in my view (which was true for some of my friends who saw it too and loved it) and stands on its own absolutely brilliantly.It looks beautiful, it is beautifully shot throughout and the scenery is picture perfect. Loved too the sensitivity of the direction, that allows the drama to take its time while giving it momentum as well. Definitely indicative of someone in full control and understanding of the material and with a willingness to treat it in a respectful and accessible way.One of the best things about 'Coda' was the soundtrack, which was nothing short of amazing and you know a soundtrack is brilliant when it is like a character of its own while not just perfectly placed throughout but also wonderful on its own. One of the best of the year. Not just the original score, which is sparingly used but is haunting and sensitive when used with particularly clever use of the strings, or the seamless inclusions of the likes of Etta James, Marvin Gaye and David Bowie classics. But also the hugely powerful ""Beyond the Shore"", how it was not even nominated for an Oscar is beyond comprehension (especially when it is memorable than the song that actually won).Another major strength was the acting, in the best ensemble cast of the year for me. Emilia Jones is a revelation in a truly expressive and truly inspiring performance that really connected with me. Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotspur are also outstanding in performances of great warmth and sincerity, Kotspur has one of the most emotional scenes of the year when he is with Jones and gets her to sing while feeling the throat. Eugenio Derbez is wonderfully wry, and while his character is of the inspirational kind it is one that doesn't fall too much into cliche territory. 'Coda' is also one of the very few films seen recently where all the characters were relatable.Furthermore, the script is a beautifully balanced mix of genuinely amusing humour and sincere, touching drama, the coming of age element being so easy to relate to. The story isn't too conventional, despite it sounding so on paper, even with some elements that are seen a lot in other coming of age tales yet fresh spins are put on it. It goes at a gentle pace but never becomes dull, and is full of immensely charming and poignant scenes. Also had no problem with its portrayal of the deaf community, am a disabled person myself and not only was the exploring of an under-represented disability appreciated, and with honesty and tact, it was so refreshing to actually see it embraced and in a way that was inspiring rather than treated as a negative. So many disabilities and conditions are stereotyped and often negatively too often, which has always been so frustrating, and there have been times when someone intended to be positive but comes over as unintentionally patronising, which 'Coda' does not do. It especially shines and resonates in the heart wrenching final act.Overall, absolutely captivating and truly beautiful. 10/10.~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 20 March 2023"

Loved it! Best movie ever! You told all your friends about it, the great music, the cool characters, the gear cars? You talked about it for years, for decades, and then it turned up again, so you dragged your family to see a cool movie that was done right. And as you sat through it for the second time, you wondered ""What happened to the movie I saw when I was a kid? This is nothing at all like it! The lines are stupid, the music is lame and the actors are gargoyles! What happened to it?""This is that movie. It's not the movie you saw, it's the movie you remembered. It's got great music and great cars that dance, and actors who behave like Steve MacQueen, and Kevin Spacey shoots the really bad guys -- not the bank robbers, those are the heroes, but the really bad guys, and says ""I was in love once."" Edgar Wright -- whom I know from the movies he directed Simon Pegg in -- has directed a gangster-car-chase-teen-love movie that does what Justin Lin, Guy Ritchie and those other hot directors tried to do, but could not. Yeah. This is the movie you remembered.~boblipton rated 9/10 on 9 July 2021"," Believe the hype: Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening in Denver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens, and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I think troll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewer has reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lot of tens either.Best film so far this year.~somf rated 10/10 on 22 June 2017"," Action flick with endless panache and swagger: There is never a dull moment in this action crime film about a getaway driver who has his own unlimited getaway soundtrack but who also wants to break free from the crime boss who owns his life.There is enough style and visceral strut in this film that it neutralizes the one or two credibility gaps in the plot. Ansel Elgort is great as the title character, but Jamie Foxx steals the film with a lively performance as the loose cannon in the crew. Performances all around are solid and the dialogue is so rife with dueling wits, it's like watching a recurring display of verbal fireworks. These firecracker scenes of competitive criminals showing off their bravado are just as exciting as the chase scenes through downtown Atlanta.The film also banks heavily on a heady, omnipresent soundtrack that keeps the tempo perpetually hyperactive. A word of caution: The action can be tough going at times; the film revels in its permanent state of anarchy before ultimately developing a mean streak. But for all the blistering gunfire and screeching tires, this is not a one-note film. It has its moments of quietly boiling tension and eerie backstory flashbacks. It's a film that wears its attitude on its sleeve and doesn't shrivel into conventionality. Not an absolute bull's eye, but recommended to everyone who wants a good rush.~PotassiumMan rated 8/10 on 2 July 2017"," Fun Car-Chase Thriller Action Drama: A brisk action thriller that includes fast cars, guns, and a good selection of music.Though I enjoyed the scenes, the movie is forgettable and presents nothing new to the table. It's a fun movie, yes, but feels like a pulp fiction of the genre. The storyline is shallower than a kiddie swimming pool.3/5. Average and forgettable. The movie does keep a good pace, but that's not enough to save it.~mikayakatnt rated 6/10 on 13 January 2020"," The Coolest & Most Unique Film This Year: Edgar Wright remains one of my all-time favourite directors. Why? Because each and every film he crafts reeks of originality, he takes a few similar traits, throws them together, delves down a completely unexpected route and forms something unique, something masterful. From 'Shaun of the Dead' to 'Hot Fuzz' and so on and so forth, each film feels like something you think you've witnessed before, but on a whole new level, something fresh, something alluring, packed with adrenaline... and of course, 'Baby Driver' followed suit.'Baby Driver' is an utterly engrossing caper-comedy that is (in my personal opinion) the finest film to face 2017 so far, I couldn't help but smile throughout, from the stunningly executed action scenes and stunts, through to the soundtrack (with an abundance of classic rock and soul tracks) and finally the heavily relatable characters. The lack of disappointment in Edgar Wright's work continues with this masterful film, which is ultimately also one of the coolest films of the past decade or so.Many of the heist films of recent years have been rather disappointing when it comes to both story and technical achievement, however when something like 'Baby Driver' makes an appearance, it's refreshing to know that indie films are still taking this planet by storm and shunting the blockbusters out of the limelight. To know that certain production companies still trust the creativity of a director over the monetary expectations, and by doing so, unleashing a flurry of fantastic independently ""driven"" films.I'm gonna finish with this (partially odd) statement / testimonial... when I went to sleep last night, I had odd dreams of car chases and stunt driving to rock classics, and that is thanks to this film, the fact that it stuck with me even when I wasn't fully conscious. That's how much of a damn cool film 'Baby Driver' is... just go watch it, just throw away your tickets to 'Transformers' and 'The Mummy' etc, and go see this instead.~CalRhys rated NA on 29 June 2017", Overrated: The only thing I can say for sure about Baby Driver is that this movie is highly overrated. It certainly doesn't deserve such a high rating as it does now on here. It's an easy to watch action movie but not the best one in this genre. The plot isn't difficult to understand and it isn't that bad either but the characters are what brings this movie down. Too much have-you-see-me characters just don't do any good to the movie. I really doubt criminals and bank robbers would act like they do before a heist. It would be for sure a disaster every time. Kevin Spacey is the big name in Baby Driver but don't watch this movie to see him in action. He did much better movies than this one. The rest of the cast can clearly act but it's just their ridiculous characters that makes this just an average action movie.~deloudelouvain rated 5/10 on 17 October 2017," This is why I love movies: I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine.~kevindehulsters rated 9/10 on 28 June 2017"," A film so in love with itself, it needs its own cinema seat: ""Baby Driver"" is showy, cliché-ridden and irritatingly self-aware. It's like that yappy drama society kid at college who is so consciously trying to act cool by breaking into song, dancing around chairs, drumming on desks and spitting jokey one-liners with a hand pistol flourish....the kind of person a cynical SOB like me just wants to punch in the throat.The central premise is about a young, good-at-heart kid forced into a life of crime in order to pay off a debt. The annoyingly slick, Abercrombie-faced ""Baby"" is not only the fastest getaway driver in Atlanta, we later find out he's also a self-taught music producer, dancer and talented free-runner...are you rolling your eyes yet?The main mechanic, so lauded by critics, is that everything in the film revolves around music, from the editing to the dialogue. Since Baby is constantly plugged into his i-pod (so, we are told, to drown out tinnitus from a car accident which killed his parents), the film essentially plays like one giant music video, with nearly every gunshot, tire screech and sassy put down edited meticulously with the beats or riffs of whatever track is playing during the sequence.Unfortunately the songs didn't make the hackneyed screenplay that much more interesting. While there are some splendid car chase sequences (too few in my book), one must endure cringey moments of Baby miming and dancing to James Brown, dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics and saying cliché bull$hit like ""Sometimes all I want to do is head west on the 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have"". Everyone in the film is pretty, none of the gangsters really look like gangsters, least of all the Latina 'Darling', who can't even hold a gun convincingly and is just there to show cleavage and lick her lips at camera.Imagine the most indulgent ideas from Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's trash bin channeled through a Justin Bieber video. Less style and even less substance.There are no doubt people who will love it for being a showy piece of nonsense, and there is some entertaining, high impact action, but it's far from the genius some critics are praising it as. I saw it with a group of youngish people who all agreed it wasn't as good as they'd hoped and that some bits were just plain daft.Leave your brain at home and perhaps you'll be rewarded...~Deathstryke rated 5/10 on 2 July 2017"," Way over-hyped! Not a great or even good movie.: Everyone's gushing about how the music matched a few scenes and I mean like.... Yeah? Welcome to movies, where sound is designed to match the scenes.There wasn't anything amazing.Bad acting from the main character. Bad writing as well, he makes a lot of stupid decisions which I suppose are the reason the story exists. Lazy and unrealistic writing. No chemistry between him and his ""love"" who are in love and run away after a date which entails going for dinner and then ending. This girl must be lonely as hell despite being a good looking waitress. She wants to leave her job and her friends behind for a man she doesn't know at all, except that he's friends with some criminal elements... And she's like hell yeah lets do this!OH and I assume she remains celibate for 5 years for him at a point. Again... They have had one date and barely any conversation, and no nookie.Just a lot of terrible writing in this like that which bothered me. The action and music scenes were okay.

With pretty ladies and lots of car chases.The main character Baby's pompous and annoying and the actor not worthy, while the other characters are quite likable. The problem is the film focuses on Baby; and his music which I mostly didn't like or either already have. The waitress Debora, looks like a young Elisabeth Shue.

Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time. Travolta is a revelation in arguably his greatest role. The other players are adequate and the screenplay is deceptively smarter than it appears on the surface. The movie also works as a time capsule to a part of contemporary American history where discos and bell-bottoms were all the rage. Still one of the finer films of the time period. 4.5 out of 5 stars.~tfrizzell rated NA on 23 June 2004"," ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" - Tony Manero.: I love this movie.I love the way it focuses on dancing, yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes, long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor, but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle: Trying to escape from your boring daily routine, even if it is just for an hour.That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store, then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint, where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking cliché. In a sad sort of way, it's true.But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin: ""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime."" ""Saturday Night Fever"" is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way, Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.""Saturday Night Live's"" theme tune, ""Staying Alive"" (the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel), speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. ""I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me, I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me yeah"" chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now, I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song, and for good reason.I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But ""Saturday Night Fever"" makes me feel as if I had--and that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon, and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. (In the Travolta film ""Get Shorty,"" a criminal threatens a producer by saying that, if he doesn't pay up, he'll be ""dead as disco."" Ironic.)Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero, a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fame--as brief as it may be--and the most obvious theme of the film, which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey, a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantly-waxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that, he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.Part of this movie is learning to grow up, and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plots--the other is, of course, trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background, and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son, who became a priest, and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son, and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from $3 to $4, his father tells him that $4 can't even buy $3. His son swears at him and storms away.Some of my favorite scenes in ""Saturday Night Live"" are the human ones, such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror, bare-chested, and combs his hair forever, looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" scene in ""Taxi Driver,"" released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from ""Serpico"" and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. (Just think, Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo, yet he was, in a way, in the first film, too.) I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family. He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work, but after working for quite some time on his now-out-of-date hairstyle, he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner (in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh). He yells at him: ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" I know that scene has been quoted before, but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard.In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie, and certainly one of the most touching, Tony has lunch with an older girl (who later becomes his dance partner) and tries to impress her by acting mature. But his immaturity shines through--he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time, and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower. In a way, this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were.This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbers--I love them, and I probably shouldn't. As for the right reasons...I think we already know what they are. It's all about dreams. Everyone has some. Whether it's dancing or whatever, we all have dreams. And that's why I think ""Saturday Night Fever"" relates to so many different people on so many different levels.~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 14 January 2004"," Beautifully Defines An Era On The Backdrop Of A Realistic Class Study and Dynamic Music: Although it may seem dated and cheesy to some viewers today Saturday Night Fever remains one of the most underrated examples of '70s pop-culture. It is undoubtedly the quintessential dance flick and remains one of the most entertaining films of all-time. Yet, behind all the music and entertaining aura you are actually viewing a drama studying the American class system and young rebellion. Though at times it is slightly exaggerated, it still manages to capture a vast amount of authenticity and ultimately the sights and sounds of the time.Saturday Night Fever follows self-proclaimed ""dance king"" Tony Manero (John Travolta) and his love of dancing and the trials and tribulations of his life in the Bronx. He soon meets an arrogant fellow dancer named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Quickly becoming attracted and influenced by the women he starts questioning the way he lives his life.The film is not always upbeat and at times can be depressing, particularly the scenes depicting peer-pressure. Although both have their differences, both are very alike and ultimately want to be something ""big"". There are also the elements of jealously, rivalry, religion, rebellion, respect and racism added into the film. This captures the realism of the time and with more accuracy and honesty than a lot of films. Just take a look at the brief scene where Tony is on the tube, this is an oddly poignant, effecting and compelling scene presenting Tony's confused emotions.Saturday Night Fever still carries the vibe, rhythm and atmosphere it did back in '77. It remains one of the most influential films for both the film-world and pop-culture. Infamously holding some of the greatest dance sequences ever committed film; you can feel the energy, emotions, time and determination that were spent perfecting the dance scenes to the finest detail. The lighting is perfect at creating the ""disco world"", the set-piece of the 2001 Disco is one of the film's many iconic highlights.John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the ""strut"" in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being ""cool"". All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets.~Det_McNulty rated 8/10 on 20 March 2007"," It has it's moments of absolute glory: Saturday Night Fever is thoughtful, engaging, and sometimes brilliant. While some might call it one of the greatest films ever, I must disagree. But along the lines of a groundbreaker, yes it is.  The film does for disco what Suburbia did for punk.  And the film gives John Travolta, the cool Italian guy from Engelwood, NJ a good break.  He plays a paint guy who at nights (and sometimes days) has a love for dancing, which he is absolutely excellent at (those dance scenes are quite memorable).  Not always on the money, but when it is, it delivers the goods.  Bee Gees provide songs here that everybody likes (I would have to assume from Wayne Campbell's statement in Wayne's World).  A-~Quinoa1984 rated 7/10 on 18 March 2001"," I Don't See Anyone Givin You A Raise Down At Unemployment: I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the ""Edited For Television"" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.""Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere."" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his ""station in life"" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.~Bandit1974 rated 10/10 on 5 January 2006"," Modern, and Misunderstood, Classic: While the movie is more apt to be recalled for its impact on American pop culture, few who watch the movie will ever see beyond the admittedly fantastic dance sequences.  As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.  While his quick study under Denny Terrio for those dance sequences showed a great deal of determination, Travolta's Tony Manero shines in so many other way.  The looks of embarrassment and exasperation that his character expresses when confronted with the possibility of working in a Bay Ridge paint store all of his life, or the prejudice and regional chauvinism of his friends, or the behavior of his friends at White Castle or his initial inability to express himself to Stephanie in any way that might impress her, all of these and more contribute to a fully realized character. While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence.  While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.Forget those who call this a musical.  While the music is an intricate part of the film and setting, Travolta's performance is what sets this film apart.~notarepublican rated 9/10 on 17 June 2003"," There's no denying it...: ... this is a product of my generation. I was the age that Travolta's character Tony was in 1977, although in a completely different part of the US. Probably the disco era is the only one in the history of film in which people in street clothes look like they are going to a costume party. The pointy collars, the shoes, the hair so full of hairspray that it looks like it would shatter if it brushed up against something, and those jackets that are so full of holes - big ones - they look like they were attacked by moths and why are we calling them jackets anyways?So Tony (Travolta) is a New York City born and bred Italian American with only a high school education, an employee at a dead end job - selling and mixing paint - in a store that is now extinct - the neighborhood hardware store that is about to get replaced by the big box hardware stores such as Harbor Freight. Dad is used to being the head of the family, but now he has been laid off in middle age. Suddenly Edith is talking back and disrespecting Archie and he doesn't like it one bit. And the only thing that makes Tony feel alive is Saturday nights on the dance floor of the local disco where he is the best.And then he meets a girl - Stephanie. She is everything that I, a Texan, was told that New Yorkers are - loud mouthed, self important, snooty. And yet Tony follows her around like a puppy because he is in love. Annette (Donna Pescow) follows Tony around like a puppy because she is in love. It's funny how Tony doesn't like how Stephanie treats him, yet he turns around and treats Annette the same way. But Tony turns out to be much more self aware than you would think. And Stephanie - there is much more to her story than her being just another stuck up Manhattanite.There is so much casual sex going on here that it answers the question ""Where did herpes come from?"". But it is so much more than glittering disco balls. it is a love story. A story of a guy learning about the friendship component of love. It is a tragedy. It is a story of young people at a crossroads. And last but not least, it has probably one of the great soundtracks in motion picture history and gave the Bee Gees a second act. I'd highly recommend it. Just try to ignore your probable first reaction ""Yikes those clothes!!!!"""".~AlsExGal rated 8/10 on 8 March 2020"," Gritty urban tale: 1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music scene. How ironic then that the final number one single in the U.S. of that year was Debbie Boone's ""You light up my life"". While I think that the punk movement has never been well documented in film fiction, the more popular and mainstream disco culture had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was Saturday Night Fever (SNF).The snag is that SNF was NOT a disco movie. Yes, it had dazzling dance sequences, yes, it had a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes were shot in a disocteque, but I have always felt that the disco theme was peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the acceptance and sanctuary they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, Nik Cohn's article on which the film was based (and which he later admitted was faked), ""Tribal rites of the new Saturday night"" would have been a more apposite title. John Travolta perfectly captures this. As Tony Manero he almost ritually prepares himself for his night out, preening himself in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and then escaping the drudgery of his existence to his battleground, the local disco where he is the tribal chief.Gritty, foulmouthed and somewhat downbeat, SNF starkly presented the darker underbelly of the disco subculture.~hayden-8 rated NA on 28 April 2002"," You Should Be Dancing!: Saturday NIGHT FEVER (1977) **** John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Joseph Cali, Barry Miller, Julie Bovasso, Val Bosoglio, Donna Pescow. Quintessential film about the Seventies' disco craze that made Travolta an American icon (Best Actor nominee) and superstar as Brooklynite Tony Manero, a free-wheelin' Italian kid who loves to dance but doesn't know what he wants from life despite his talent and some eye-opening advice from dance partner Gorney. Directed on location with gritty realism by John Badham this blockbuster features songs by the ultimate trio The Bee Gees.(My favorite: ""How Deep Is Your Love?""). Look for Fran Drescher and Denny Dillon in the dance sequences. For the film vault: a snake-hipped, lupine Travolta cutting loose to ""You Should Be Dancing.""~george.schmidt rated 10/10 on 6 June 2002"," Sunday morning hangover: Last night, I saw ""Saturday Night Fever"" on TV. It brought back memories of my own disco days in the mid- to late 1970s. Sad to say, the film perfectly captures the emptiness and superficiality of that era, and its negative impact on people's lives, then and since.Back then, it was all about how you looked and how you dressed, how you danced and whether you scored. Who knew that the slim, sleek, svelte Travolta would balloon like Elvis Presley - just as all of us were fated to age, lose our hair and expand our waists. The disco culture of the 70s was youth-oriented, but in a brain-dead way, unlike the politically aware late 1960s anti-war youth culture.""Saturday Night Fever"" sends mixed messages. Its soundtrack of BeeGees hits is a siren song of longing and romance, yet the screenplay tells a different story. Tony Manero (John Travolta) rejects poor Annette (Donna Pescow) because she's short and dumpy and not good enough for him. Upwardly mobile Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) spurns him in turn, offering only the possibility of platonic friendship. Tony's friend Bobby gets his girlfriend pregnant, but is too young and immature to assume his responsibilities. And all Tony's other friends care about is humping virtual strangers for ten minutes in the back seat of a car.Saturday night fever gives them nothing but Sunday morning hangover - without any Sunday morning spirituality to fill the void in their lives. Religion gets short shrift in this film. Tony's brother Frank leaves the priesthood, not because he struggles with his faith, but because he can't live up to his vow of celibacy. Even he has sex on the brain.Sex was the be-all and end-all of disco culture - witness the soft-core shots of Travolta in nothing but low-rise briefs - and we have inherited its legacy. I say ""we"" because I too am a child of the 70s. For the next 25 years, I lived according to the values I had learned on the dance floor. I worshipped at the shrine of youth and beauty and sex - and it left me as empty as the characters in the film. Like Tony Manero, I found that the only cure for ""Saturday Night Fever"" was to escape that world and that life, and leave all the ""beautiful losers"" behind.~livewire-6 rated NA on 30 March 2004"
Almost Famous (2000) - IMDb,7.9,Billy Crudup|Patrick Fugit|Kate Hudson|Frances McDormand|Jason Lee|Zooey Deschanel|Michael Angarano|Anna Paquin|Fairuza Balk|Noah Taylor|John Fedevich|Mark Kozelek|Philip Seymour Hoffman|Liz Stauber|Jimmy Fallon|Olivia Rosewood|Bijou Phillips|Alice Marie Crowe,Cameron Crowe,Cameron Crowe,A high-school boy in the early 1970s is given the chance to write a story for Rolling Stone magazine about an up-and-coming rock band as he accompanies them on their concert tour.," Crowe knows what it is love some little piece of music so much that it hurts: There's a (by now) well-known scene early on in ALMOST FAMOUS when William Miller is poring through the records his older sister Anita has left behind for him since she ran off from home.  Inside the album cover of The Who's TOMMY, she leaves William a note, telling him to listen to this with a candle lit, and he'll be able to see his future.  He puts on the record, ""Sparks"" comes on, and the look on his face as he listens is the look every rock fan will recognize.There's been tons of stuff written about rock-n-roll music, from those who think, like William's mother Elaine, that it's a corrupting influence(or those who go even farther and consider it ""the devil's music""), to those who insist the music is meaningless and to take it seriously smacks of pretension, because it's ""only music.""  And then there are people like Cameron Crowe, who recognize rock-n-roll, and the music which came in its wake, is the shared experience of many people starting from the 1950's, in the way maybe that plays and earlier types of music were in centuries before.  Sure, there's television and movies as well, but rock music is shorter and more direct.  And sure, it can just be fun and a way to cut loose once in a while, but it's also something which can speak to what we love, what we long for, what we're afraid of, what we think, what wounds us inside, and so much more.Because Crowe is a fan, he's able to capture all of this in his movie.  It's not just in the obvious moments, like the people on the tour bus singing along to Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer,"" which lifts them out of their black mood, or singer Jeff Bebe leading everybody into singing ""On the Cover of Rolling Stone"" when he learns he and his fellow bandmates will be on the cover.  It's in the wild spirit of people like Sapphire, one of the Band-Aids(read: groupies) who follow the band Stillwater and others as they tour the U.S., or in the more tender spirit of someone like her sister Band-Aid Penny Lane, who believes she and the other Band-Aids serve as a muse to bands like Stillwater, and who soaks in all of her experiences like a sponge.  It's also in William, who tries(like Crowe did) to balance reporting with his very obvious love for the music.  And it's especially in the line I quoted from at the top, which Sapphire says to Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond late in the movie.  To be sure, the road of rock-n-roll isn't all covered in roses.  There's outrageous behavior(like how Russell treats Penny, or William losing his virginity to three of the groupies), drugs, excess, and yes, pretension(like when Jeff lectures Penny about the power of rock-n-roll and then adds, ""And the chicks are cool, right?""  But those who wanted this to be more like THIS IS SPINAL TAP are missing the point.  This isn't a movie about the obvious problems and silliness in rock music.  It's about what still draws people to it, and though Crowe acknowledges these people's faults, he still loves them for who they are.Of course, there's a lot more reasons why ALMOST FAMOUS is a great movie besides its love of rock-n-roll.  It's well acted across the board(in addition to all the performances mentioned several times, I'd like to highlight Fairuza Balk as Sapphire; not only does she get the best line in the movie(along with Frances McDormand's ""Don't take drugs!"" and ""Rock stars have kidnapped my son"") with that line about music(I also like what she and the other groupies yell as they're about to deflower William, ""Death to Opie!""), but she also captures the carefree spirit of the time.  She may not be important plot wise, but if you took her character out, the movie would be missing something), it's a terrific coming-of-age story, it's a bittersweet love story, the dialogue is great, and it looks terrific.  But it's Crowe's obvious love for the music, and for the people who love it, that makes ALMOST FAMOUS the best thing I've seen so far this year.~SKG-2 rated 10/10 on 5 October 2000"," One of my favourite movies of all-time: Finally, a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar, it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie ""Penny Lane"", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater's lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.The plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!~segacs rated 10/10 on 5 February 2005"," Not almost, but totally: Now I don't know all the facts about the real stories behind this, but it is obvious that there is so much love and research to what happened, that it translates onto the screen. You can feel the love for what is being shown and you can feel the passion of the makers of this. Including everyone involved.I did watch the alternate longer cut of it (called the Bootleg version), so I can't really talk about the original theatrical cut. But I can advise anyone to watch the longer cut. It is more than worth it. It is really amazing and breathtaking. The story holds up and we can identify either with the boy or other characters of the movie, which make it so accessible.The humor, the music, the acting, the way this was put/edited together help elevate it to a different degree. I almost feel ashamed having not seen it before. But I made good for it, so I could sort of celebrate the 20th anniversary of it.~kosmasp rated 10/10 on 19 May 2020"," Nearly Flawless 💯: The casting of Almost Famous is perfection. The music is sublime; Would one expect anything less with Nancy Wilson at the helm of the soundtrack? The cost of syncing some of the most iconic classic rock songs must have cost investors a pretty penny - it was money well-spent, as the film thrives on one of the best soundtrack syncs in movie history.Almost Famous is classic Cameron Crowe - a semi-autobiographical film that pulls from his own experiences as a young journalist with Rolling Stone magazine in its glory daze of the early 1970's. Yes, most of the events in the movie (including the airplane scene) really DID happen with Crowe there to witness (albeit being an amalgam of different bands and circumstances Cameron covered as a rock journalist).You care about the characters who are developed and illuminated throughout the film. Crowe's spot-on casting and ""actors' director"" prowess serves as a catalyst for the actors, inspiring the cast to draw out the intimate feelings and thoughts of each character without crossing into melodrama - The result is an acting ensemble tour de force.Almost Famous is a must-see for both classic-rock fans and movie lovers at large.You get to witness several breakout early-career performances including Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschannel, Billy Crudup, and yes, even Jimmy Fallon.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Francis McDormand are as usual, nearly flawless.Get a back-stage pass to this fabulous movie - a loving ode to the early 70's twilight days of the classic rock era.~Instant_Palmer rated 10/10 on 30 August 2015"," The best of 2001: Elaine (Frances McDormand) is an all-controlling weirdness mother in San Diego, and her daughter Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels running away.

Then forward to 1973, William is a 15 year old high school music geek who has written a few things for magazines. Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is his all-talk mentor. While trying to interview Black Sabbath, he befriends Band-aid Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Then he meets Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and the band Stillwater. A few praises and he's in with the band. Then Rolling Stone magazine calls.This is based on director Cameron Crowe's life as a young Rolling Stone reporter. As such, it has an air of truth in this fictional account. It hits all the correct notes. It is fun, poignant, and heart warming in all the right places. Kate Hudson is an instant star. The music is wonderful. It won the Oscar for best writing, but I would pick this over any of the best picture nominees. It is simply better than the best of that year.~SnoopyStyle rated 9/10 on 19 April 2014"," An Excellent Original Insight Into The 70's Rock Scene... With Dazzling Performances.: There was a time in the US rock circuit before music videos and online marketing. That was the time when several little-known bands toured all over the country... accompanied mostly by drugs and groupies. Writer-director Cameron Crowe takes us to that infamous scene of sex, drugs and rock n' roll in the 1970's with this semi-autobiographical work, which is not only equipped with his brilliant direction and screenplay, but also by decent performances by some relatively lesser-known actors.Here the introduction of a not-too-famous band, an imaginary one called Stillwater, was important. In that sense, Stillwater is a perfect work by Crowe... with a volatile relationship between the vocalist and the guitarist, with a noncompetent manager and everything that comes with. There were also the groupies, who became a matter of substance in Crowe's point of view. But the most extraordinary thing that Crowe did is the image of himself as a 15-year-old writing prodigy, rock journalist William Miller. The viewers watch the movie through Miller's eyes. The character is extremely well-designed and reserved by Crowe. Miller's the one who becomes able to attach all the parts into a complete movie alone.Billy Crudup was probably the best among the actors as guitarist Russell Hammond. It's true his role was not a tough one, but he's the one who made it look so easy. Young Kate Hudson, as Penny Lane, is perfect and very adorable. She showed her potentials in this movie which seemed even better than her mother, Goldie Hawn. All she needs are decent roles in future. The other actors, namely Jason Lee as vocalist Jeff, Frances McDormand as Williams's over-protective mother and the other band-aids (with Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) performed also quite well. And newcomer Patrick Fugit, as Miller himself, is really brilliant. Gaining more screen time than anyone else, it was a tough test for Fugit and it is all praises for him.The soundtrack was very good with some fine original songs. There may be some minor flaws in the movie, like some unnecessary sequences, but all over this is a quite masterful work... a feast for the mind and soul, both for a hard rock n' roll fan and for casual viewers.~shanfloyd rated 9/10 on 7 June 2003"," ""incendiary"": This is probably one of the best semi-autobiography film I seen and probably the best work by Cameron Crowe so far. It just absorbed me from the beginning, although it has mostly non well known actors and actresses at the time. Just about all of them stood out, even the ones that didn't have much screen-time. This could have gone in the typical and predictable sex, drugs and rock n' roll direction. Sure it has sex, drugs and rock n' roll. But it goes in more of the insight direction and realistic direction. When it comes to the rock band, money, jealousy, marketing, trying to be cool and image. All of it was just so darn entertaining and intriguing to watch from the perspective of a young naive and innocent boy trying to make it as a journalist. In the story it focuses in on this young journalist boy going on tours with a fictitious rock band called Stillwater. And the journey although it has the typical sex, drugs and rock n' roll elements. It does although focuses in on the inner areas of the rockers the groupies or band aids and the obstacles they go through. Although most of the tour is full of booze, drugs and sex. But it doesn't go in a dark, depressing and hardcore direction. This is more lighthearted, mellow and laid back. All the elements fit together well, the chemistry and the conflicts are well blended together superbly. This film just seemed to have the right flow to it. And I personally kinda got attached to some of the characters during their journey or tour. Overall this is one of the best going with the group, getting attached and coming of age type of film I thoroughly enjoyed. If you know the bands in the 70's and the music in this movie, chances are you will probably enjoy it even more with the references.9.3/10~KineticSeoul rated 9/10 on 10 August 2013"," Outstanding: William has an overprotective mother, and his sister has already been driven away by her refusal to accept her children's ambitions and interests.

It's certainly one of mine. But, twenty years after I've found myself wondering if it's the movie that I like or if it's the music.I mean, it references Lester bangs, and he is played by Hoffman. And it is a Crowe film. But it's about Rolling Stone when Rolling Stone was important and not the hallow shadow of it's former self.And with that tale about Rolling Stone's former glory it tells the story about Rock and Roll before it caved into New Wave, Disco, and was finally washed away with the auto-tune and drum machine bubblegum pop that needs a mass burning in Soldier Field in the near future.But look at the sound track, Simon and Garfunkle, The Who, Iggy Pop, Black Sabbath, Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers, The Seeds, Fleetwood Mac, everyone's favorite Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cat Stevens, and my favorite Elton John song.And those are just the highlights. But, that is a playlist, that is an record collection. Most everyone has an album by one of those bands.And, of course, Still Water is a place savor for the Allman Brothers and in some cases it's so obvious it hurts.So, is it one of my favorite films? Twenty years on do I really love this film or do I love the soundtrack? Do I love the era it portrays when Rock was still relevant and the Rolling Stone still meant something?Honestly I don't know... because, at the end of the day, I do really love this movie. I mean, Frances McDormand is in it... but honestly, I think I just love the music a little more.Fortunately, I am Gen-X, I grew up with Pearl Jam and Nirvana and Green Day. I grew up with grunge and punk and I thank God every day that I turn on the radio that I had worthy bands to follow and record stores were still a part of my life.I'd hate to be my wife's age. I'd hate to be a Millennial. I'd hate to be Gen-Z... but a big part of me would have loved to be a Boomer, would have loved to be my father's age, even with all the problems, just because they got experience all that music when it was still new, still fresh, and the musicians were still in their prime and preforming at the top of their games.So, yeah, I love the movie but I like the music a heck of a lot more.~generationofswine rated 10/10 on 20 January 2020"," Perhaps the Best Film of the Decade: Almost Famous (2000) **** (out of 4)Cameron Crowe's masterpiece about high schooler William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who gets a job with Rolling Stone to do a story on an upcoming band named Stillwater. The young and naive kid gets to go out on the road with them where he quickly grows up and sees that the world isn't always perfect. ALMOST FAMOUS is one of the greatest coming of age movies ever made and it's perhaps the greatest love story to rock 'n roll ever filmed. I think a strong argument could also be made that it's the greatest film of the decade as well. There's so much love and passion during every single scene that you can't help but see and feel that this is Crowe's baby and it's easy to see why since much of this is based on his life growing up. This film contains so many terrific moments but I think what makes it so special are the various relationships that are built on the road. This includes William trying to mix it up with the band's guitar player (Billy Crudup) who refuses to give him an interview as well as the girl (Kate Hudson) that both of them love for different reasons. The overly worried mother (Frances McDormand) is perfectly written and thrown into the story for some comic relief but even the smaller characters are so well-written and detailed that by the time the movie is over it's almost like you've seen a documentary of a real band. Crowe's direction has never been better as this film has quite a bit of different emotions going for it yet he perfectly holds it together and really makes the film take off to levels one wouldn't expect. As a fan of rock and roll you have to love the behind-the-scenes look at a tour and the various problems that come from the sex and drugs. You also have to have fun and admire this young kid being able to go out on the road as this would be an ultimate dream job for many. The film mixes in some terrific music but the highlight is of course 'Tiny Dancer' from Elton John, which is without question one of the best and most magical scenes from any movie. The performances are all a major plus from the bigger acts to the smaller roles. Everyone fits their roles perfectly and help bring the story to life. ALMOST FAMOUS is a flawless picture that just keeps getting better with each new viewing. Some say the film is too soft and should have attacked the music harder or been more raw but I really disagree with these comments. The film is a love story to the music and one of the greatest out there.~Michael_Elliott rated NA on 8 February 2013"

It was completely insane but in the end I was just like ok sure.It does sag in the middle for me, maybe if they had got it down to an hour 30, I think that would have made it even better.The costumes were pretty great too especially the wedding dress.The end of the movie does seem to turn into a parody of its self which I did find slightly confusing. I didn't know if the film makers did it on purpose or not.~Neon_Gold rated 6/10 on 12 February 2022"," The RomCom is a dead art: The plot for this is silly but workable and takes a swipe at the manufactured state of modern life in the spotlight.Ironically this film suffers from the aliments it pokes fun at.The garish product placement, the awkward tokenism, the forced one-liners, promotional music videos, and relentless social commentary drains the warmth from this movie, making it feel contrived in a very clinical way.The characters feel like they rolled off the Role-model Factory: safe, sterile and dull. I didn't care about them at all.Both are self-sufficient individuals who don't need each other beyond the superficial - one is happy in her ivory tower of wealth the other content in his smug self-righteousness - so they might as well go their own ways.Jennifer's character is always in complete control of every situation, she always looks flawless and is propped up by immense material resources allowing herself to buy her way out of any situation, any issue she has is really only a minor inconvenience that will pass - making her hard to relate to.Owen Wilson plays himself as usual, his character is very plain, which is ok. But again he has everything he ever wanted, apart from his daughter's admiration, which is quite easily purchased.Whereas Julia Roberts was - just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.Jennifer Lopez is - just a woman, working in an industry that marginalises women, asking a man to rewrite a patriarchal narrative so she can show her social media audience she is strong and independent.Whether you agree with that sentiment or not is one thing, but it certainly isn't romantic or comedic.~thekarmicnomad rated 3/10 on 12 February 2022"," I Think I Just Saw The Entire Movie in the Trailer: Seriously, talk abut not leaving anything to your imagination. IMDb policy always asks if your review has spoilers. What is there left to spoil? Let me guess. They live happily ever after?The premise is completely ridiculous, but the dumber the better, right? They say this was adapted from a graphic novel, but it seems more like it came from a bar napkin while Hollywood writers were ""brainstorming"" at happy hour.~leftbanker-1 rated 5/10 on 11 February 2022"," A Really Great Cheesy RomCom: Marry MeIt was fabulous.Last week Mark Kermode said the Moonfall was intergalactically dumb and this week we have Marry Me and believe me it was RomCom ridiculous.The situations was so far fetched, the acting exaggerated, outfits from Eurovision, cheesy lines and contrivances beyond the wit of man but I loved it. However, I agree, if you can't get past the bizarre scenarios and ridiculous plot then you may conclude this is the turkey of all turkeys!Why so did I like it, you may well ask, why did this old hack like it, well the on screen chemistry between this odd couple, Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson worked in spades, it was charming, believable, sweet, and it all just breathed in all the right places. These two were perfectly cast and the roles they took were right up their street.How interesting that John Bradley featured in both Moonfall and Marry Me, and they had a similar endearing charm and were both idiotically far fetched!I'm giving this a firm 7 out of 10 for total charm, and escapist entertainment.~martimusross rated 7/10 on 10 February 2022"," I Say I Do To This Fun Comedy: LIKES:Pace:-Marry Me is one of those movies that is all about getting the drama and adventure started in little time and jumps right into the quick intro.-The titular moment happens early, happens close to the trailer, and sets the stage for the rest of the movie, not taking too long to open the gates for adventures-A fun pace continues for most of the movie, briskly to get to the next fun adventure, but still allowing time for the two characters to bond in new ways-Keeps a nice entertaining pace until the very end of the movie, meaning more entertainment and relaxing.The Charm and Cuteness:-This movie is all about the cute factor that arises with the new relationship, and helps brighten up the theater or room you are watching it in.-It makes you feel happy, and offers that spark of hope and joy that seems to be needed during the modern era.-Family friendly for much of the movie due to this, with little cursing or semantics to overtake the story, again leading to enjoyable for groups and dates.-That charm factor does manage to break it out of the pure romance mode, a very strong factor to bring more audience in.-Brings elements of other movies to make the movie fun like a Kindergarten Cop element, with Wedding Planner, and a little You've Got Mail.Funny:-Not the wettest comedy, but has some good zings to chuckle and laugh at without breaking the limit.-The Dog in particular is a funny prop, that does little, but works the camera well in the jokes-A little diversity to help keep things fresh, but never deviates to far from the baseline to be forced or off the wall, again a smart move to keep with the theme.-Sticks to the charm of the movie and is not going to be too ugly or disgusting to offset the mood.The Acting:-Jennifer Lopez is stylish, chic and returns to the roots we loved with Wedding Planner and Monster in Law. Those qualities don't come at the expense of strength, but rather play nicely with it to make a more representable and likeable character-Owen Wilson's nature of low key, depressed energy manages to handle the high energy of Lopez, and brings that loveable goofy relationship that somehow is inspiring and enjoyable to see.-Maluma is okay, his strength comes in singing (talked later), but plays his role as the cad quite well in the limited time he has to act-The Victory comes in the chemistry of the leads and how well they play off of each other to craft a believable relationship that has time and attention to details.-It's that chemistry that drives a lot of the fun, brings other characters into the moment to have relevance, and elevate their own characters as a result.-Not Oscar worthy at all, but again, fun and fitting for the nature of the movie.The Style:-This is mainly a J-Lo category, but I nod to the talent of dress and costume designers in their ability to make these outfits come to life.-Marry Me has some importance on fashion, and uses it to express the mood, while also reflecting the demands of the job on profile as well.-It will make people envious, because the clothes may be curtailed, but are really fashionable and easy to mimic in the future like Hustlers. They flow, they tell a story and dang are they beautiful at times.The Music:-My favorite part after the cute fun, Marry Me's music is a centerpiece of excellence for the movie song category.-Part of the songs are just there to get your toe tapping and promote the soundtrack for you to buy, but the pop motions are fun, and go well with the scenes they are promoted over-The second set of songs hold the motion and stronger storytelling, representing the emotion and progression of the character in the face of the challenge. These songs are more about the beauty and the heart than anything else.-All songs though are very fitting, and even Maluma has a couple of songs that harmonize with the other parts of the songs, and has its own charm.DISLIKES:A Bit Cheesy at Times:-They are present in many movies, but the movie sometimes does dip into the cheesy moment to get another song in.-The dialogue at these parts loses the charm and natural flow, dipping into the forced writing that gets quoted by many, but does not offer the deepest connection.Some Characters Requiring More Time:-Though they were elevated by the main two, they still need more time to give you more of their development and meaningful involvement.-A pop star and a commoner together offer some creativity to really exploit and have fun with, but sadly is not done to the full potential leading to generic adventures-More character development needed, including the antagonist who is a very simplistic tool to get the two leads together, but offers little obstruction to the progression of the story.-With some other big names and set up plot points, there was more to dive into, but sadly did not happen and that was a bit limiting in the grand scheme of things.-Even the leads needed some more time to get the full effects and deals, but fortunately the other factors help mitigate the shallower characters.Predictable:-The movie's predictability is extraordinary, with few twists or turns on profile to spice things up or help get a few wow factors back into the movie.-If we had better character involvement and some fun adventures, the predictability would be lessened further, and would have helped make this movie feel a little less like a Hallmark movie.-Not the weakest dislike, but still something that could have helped elevate the movie by mitigating the predictability.-The end credits I expected, but did little to entertain or add hope, and again was a bit cheesy at this time.The VERDICT:Marry Me is surprisingly a very fun film that really lift the spirits for all during these tough times. It's fun, and moves at that pace that is entertaining and nontraditional for most of the romantic comedy genre films. The acting is great for the role, really elevating the fun they are having, while also helping to expand on the secondary characters, with a chemistry that you think wont' work, but really does. Throw in fun settings, clothes that again enhance the characters, while also looking good, and you establishing a charming movie that is again fun in its simplicity. With a music to provide solid storytelling as well, the movie again accomplishes the goals of a J-Lo led film. Yet, the movie needs more time, or more focus on the fun and character usage to help overshadow the predictable plot. This factor is what I would have maximized, and provided the fun element the most focus to really maximize the wonderful buddy comedy that Marry Me was. I saw this at home, but it really is the movie of the weekend for me, as there is diversity for many groups to go to, or to go solo if you are like me.Thus, my scores are:Comedy/Music/Romance: 7.5 -8.0Movie Overall: 6.5.~rgkarim rated 8/10 on 13 February 2022"," Seen the trailer? You've seen most of the movie.: But that doesn't mean that there's nothing worth checking out here. Far from it. Despite the fact that this is a thoroughly predictable rom-com with no plot points that haven't already been seen a million times, it has just enough of a fame-and-internet-culture twist to keep it interesting.It also has just enough fish-out-of-water humor from both of the lead characters and just enough charisma from our two leads to keep you smiling the whole way through. I found this movie to be incomprehensibly sweet, and I had a great time watching it.I'd honestly classify this as a guilty pleasure. Don't expect high art. Just expect to unwind and enjoy.Also, this movie reinforced my hatred of both social media and Jimmy Fallon, and it reminded me that I am completely justified in hating both things.~benjaminskylerhill rated 6/10 on 12 February 2022"
