Duffy|Jena Malone,Zack Snyder,Zack Snyder|Kurt Johnstad|Shay Hatten,"When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival."," Nothing original here: I think Zack Snyder didn't really do much research into this one. Maybe it's because it's a Netflix thing, I am not sure. There's so much borrowing from several other popular movies that I just wasn't invested in the story because it was all tooo basic and predictable.You had the Thanos and Gamora moment in there, you are the Starwars Resistance vs The First Order moment in there. You had the Darthvader type figure in there. You had the Kylo Ren character in there. And the worlds looked like something from a Starwars episode.Also the whole story was just weak, too weak for a director like Zack. I mean we've seen it done so many times from Lord of the Rings, to Game of Thrones, to even The Avengers. You are threatened by a bigger force, so you go around recruiting people to help you fight this force. That's basically it. There wasn't any rich subplot like we see in eg. Dune. Just very basic.Does it warrant a part 2, I strongly don't think it did. It's lazy writing and directing and shouldn't be encouraged.All in all, it's an ok movie. It's not bad like some reviews are saying. The effects are spot on, I loved the cinematography. The only drawbacks for me were the weak storyline, the awful fight sequence, the casting could have been better and the all too familiar scenes.~therealjaysmoke rated 6/10 on 28 December 2023"," Embarrassingly bad: Imagine you're a twelve year old boy, having watched some cool movies for the first time five minutes ago, having your bootleg toys of popular franchises and smashing them together in dirt saying ""and then"" every couple of minutes. Now imagine you get tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to make that a movie.Now imagine that being better than this.I thought Sucker Punch was bad. This is somehow worse.Below average acting, uninteresting characters, worldbuilding hastily slapped from who knows how many better franchises, including WH40K, Star Wars, World War II, Kurosawa, probably some anime and much more.Visually I would describe this as ""vulgar"", an ocular insult. And so much slo-mo, it's just silly. It just looks and feels bad, atmosphere is equal to a junkyard.Villains are so bad, heroes are no better. I get Netflix does what Netflix do, making bad expensive movies, that people watch. But this is insane.I want to make something very clear - it might look like a good movie, it is not. You shouldn't watch this and promote this. Ask better for your money.~Smarmelade rated 2/10 on 22 December 2023"," The rating is objective: The biggest problem of the movie is the plot. It is just bad. And not just the main storyline which makes little sense and the villains are comedic, but almost every interaction ends up with the viewer asking ""but, why?"" or ""how does it even make sense?"".The assembly of heroes (what the movie is about) is also rushed as hell, and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely.As for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It's not like they are even hiding.Next, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can't penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it's absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.The acting is ok, but it's difficult to judge the actors if they do good because the script tells them to follow an unnatural character arc in the first place. I'd say Sofia played Kora well, but Kora is just a poor character which is out of place in the very story she's central.It's not all bad. The picture is nice.I'd say it's the most disappointing Snyder's movie so far.~Dimakovtun rated 5/10 on 24 December 2023"," Everything you've seen done before, blended together, with a scoop of mud: A purely visual spectacle, and not even a great one at that, hidden behind a muddy filter.Every scene is farcically derivative of Star Wars, Battle Beyond the Stars, Warhammer 40K, Turok, and many other, better sources.Boutella just isn't credible leading lady material, characters are zero dimensional points, it's gratingly expositional, and the action scenes are comically ineptly choreographed, burdened with jump-cuts and slow-slow-slower-motion.The plot is a series of ""And then, and then, and then"" fetch-quests that seem like an episodic TV show, crammed into a badly edited 2 1/4 hours that feels much longer. And it ends with a jarringly pointless ""To be continued"".But... why, film, why? Why continue?~RogerBorg rated 3/10 on 30 December 2023"," I just want good sci-fi: I wanted this to be good so badly. Like really badly.Other than the world design and effects, there really isn't much else to salvage from it.In true Snyder style we've got lens flare and slow motion, but this time he's dialled it up over the top.Some of the action scenes are absolutely ruined from way too much diving in and out of slow motion.The biggest disappointment is the writing.The first 70% of the film is absolutely a waste of time and not needed.You don't find out most of the characters actual relevance until the back end of the film.Everything before that is a mixture of utterly pointless painfully boring scenes done for the sole purpose of filler.Looks great, but that's all.~BlockLike rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Well...: Well, after reading some of the reviews I sort of braced for impact. But it was not as bad as I expacted. True, the acting is well... lets say errr... below par. But so was the acting in the first Starwars movies to be honest. The graphics where above par, way beyond to my surprise. Does this make up for the not-thrar-good acting? Nope. But it eases the pain. Do I care that it has a lot in common with the original, with Starwars? Hmmm... a bit, bit not so much that I bothered to be honest. This movie is good enough on its own. Give it a chance and watch it without your mind made up already. You might end up liking it.~meelaleks rated 7/10 on 31 December 2023"," Something wrong with the writing, dialogue, and acting/directing: As an other reviewer wrote, there are wooden language, wooden expressions and wooden dialogue.The first ting I noticed in the movie was the words the actors spoke seemed like they had been written by a teenager... so many pointless words.Then there where the actors speaking the words, they just seemed wierd and emotionless.Then there are the action scenes. There are a lot of them, and they could have been really good. But the editing are just a bunch of normal speed, slow speed clipping to make it look good, and the bad guys just stand still doing nothing while the ""hero"" spends minutes moving around in the open...CGI/Greenscreen galore.. but very well done. So this is perhaps the strongest part of the movie.Waisted and nonsense slowmo sections... there are so many of them... and they are so pointless and gives nothing to the movie. There are movies and directors that know how to use slow motion sequences in a movie, and then there are this movie and director, that did not take that class... it's just a waist of time.In summary, if you are able to ignore all the writing, dialogue, acting/directing issues... its a passable scifi action movie.The movie could have been so much better, because there is a decent enough story underneath.. and they obviously had enough money to do what they wanted...I'm assuming Netflix payed for this. So I'm guessing that there where a big payday for writer/director and no requirements for quality on the delivered product. So they just cut from the budget anyone that could have given the director feedback on the uality issues.~bjjao rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," So close,Yet so far: Ah, the bittersweet symphony of ""Rebel Moon."" I hear you there, fellow traveler to Pandora and Tatooine. We can both appreciate Zack Snyder's stylistic flourishes - the slow-mo ballet of violence, the operatic landscapes, the characters carved from myth. But as the curtain falls on ""Part One,"" a mournful sigh escapes. This could have been a glorious space opera, a love letter to sci-fi's golden age, yet it stumbles over familiar tropes and squanders its vast potential.Snyder's fingerprints are all over the screen. The visuals are undeniable - gargantuan spaceships casting ominous shadows, crimson blades carving through darkness, desert vistas whispering forgotten empires. He paints with a grand brush, but the canvas starts to feel repetitive. We've seen the grizzled warrior with a troubled past, the damsel in distress with hidden fire, the villain who chews scenery like it's his birthright. It's a well-worn costume rack, and while Snyder drapes it with his signature flair, the threads of originality begin to fray.The plot, a familiar melody of rebellion against tyranny, starts strong but loses its harmonic richness. Characters, instead of complex chords, become predictable arpeggios. Their motivations are thinly veiled, their backstories a rushed montage. The dialogue, meant to resonate like thunder, echoes with the hollowness of recycled sci-fi cliches.What hurts most is the unrealized potential. The glimpses of a deeper world, the whispers of ancient powers, the seeds of a nuanced conflict - all wither in the harsh glare of action sequences. Snyder loves his spectacle, and ""Rebel Moon"" is awash in it, but spectacle alone can't sustain a film. We crave emotion, depth, resonance. We want to be swept away, not merely bombarded.So, as the credits roll, a bittersweet symphony resonates. We acknowledge the maestro's talent, the flashes of brilliance, the echoes of what could have been. But the lingering taste is one of missed notes, of potential left unrealized. ""Rebel Moon"" is a spectacle, no doubt, but a hollow one, leaving us yearning for the sci-fi opera that might have been.~magadalwarmayur rated 5/10 on 17 December 2023"," Eye Candy-Empty Shell: The Zack Snyder fanboy cult is legion. That's fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.Objectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of its average, with a few exceptions. But there's always cool stuff to look at. The usual Snyder-verse effects are on full display: long establishing shots, fight scenes using slo-mo and speed shifting, and massive objects being viewed by terrified onlookers. He's kind of a poor man's Villaneuve.The rabid followers can say what they want about ""The Snyder Cut"" Justice League, but the reality is there's no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn't there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn't fun to spend money on. Especially when it's not all that new.I do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) ""thanks, but no thanks"".So he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.It's not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I'm over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it's all a bunch of BS. I don't care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren't in this, in case you're confused), it's stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we're all a little more savvy now and wouldn't buy that stuff from them in today's market either. But maybe I'm wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.The review of the performances? Boutella? Strictly two note delivery. Honsu? Not bad, dour and angry. Hunaam? Possibly the most nuanced.The plot? Star Wars excuse aside, it's a mess. The preposterousness of engaging with their Seven Samurai recruits at moments when each is faced with a crucial test is just lazy storytelling.The villains? One dimensional and very unconvincing. One, the most visible, a bizarre space nazi foil, is so predictable and poorly written that he could be dropped into any of a number of other films. The other? The supposedly all powerful Big Bad who apparently has the power of life over death is a comic book trope of a villain. Evil for evil's sake. And the dumb resurrection of the former by the latter begs the question: how do you threaten a subordinate that you just brought back to life? And instead of original visuals, Snyder dips deeply into the visually obscene as replacement for creativity. The very last image is of a rogue droid, having gone ""wild"" after killing one of its ""masters"", standing up in a field, wearing a crown of deer antlers. Now that would have been a story worth exploring.There are much better choices to spend two hours on. Watch Rogue One, which at its core, this movie wishes it was.It's free to subscribers now, so have at it. Can't wait to see those reviews pour in.~TMAuthor23 rated 5/10 on 18 December 2023"," How did this get made ?: This is probably one of the worst films made in the last 10 year ,but the biggest question is who decided this was a good idea, and who keeps giving Zack Snyder money to make this crap!The dialogue and the cinema photography looks like it came out of a PS4 cut scene. As for the action sequences, imagine if a fanboy, got a hold of a camcorder and shot a load of matrix style inspired scenes, after the 2nd sequence it becomes quite annoyed and nauseating.It Almost like they started filming, then decided to write a plot based on previous literature or films. Every actor in the film looks like they're reciting lines from hostage video.It's telling that they couldn't get a proper studio to finance this film and instead had to go straight to streaming as no one would pay decent money to see this.The fact they've already produced a sequel, only tells you how delusional they were when they put this thing into production.~danhaines-37800 rated 3/10 on 24 December 2023"

Wielding the Black Trident's power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom."," A mix of awesome and bad: So many aspects of this movie are a complete mixed bag:1) Half of the comedy is really funny, the other half made me roll my eyes.2) Some of the one-liners are good, some made me cringe.3) A lot of the action is so cool, a lot is a screen full of gibberish.4) There are so many beautiful shots and visuals, and also horribly cartoonish CGI like in The Flash.5) I enjoyed the musical score, but it doesn't reach the level of Black Adam's. And I wasn't a fan of using classic rock tracks for a lighter tone, something we're more likely to see in a Marvel movie.6) Half the time I was invested, the other half I was unengaged and didn't care.I had an okay time wit this movie. It benefits from IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio for the entire movie. But in the biggest IMAX around, there were a total of 8 people in my theater. DC seems to have alienated its die-hard fans.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 12/21/2023)~FeastMode rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie themed rides: Aquaman and The Lost of Kingdom suffers THE SAME problem with the first installment; it DOES NOT have a distinct identity. We were shocked to see that the major problem they had in Aquaman 1 was again manifested in this sequel. If you watch a film, you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you. But this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films, almost like a parody. There's a 10-minute scene where you felt like this is from an Indiana Jones world, and then the next thing you know, you're stuck in the realm of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. We can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie. War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, Ridley Scott's Aliens and... okay, we'll stop now. The result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies. It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie-themed rides (minus the 'fun').Adding to that, the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with Ridley Scott's Alien style of exposition. Alien was a masterpiece but like we said, this is a dumpster reiteration, it was slow, it had little to no suspense, it tried to build momentum but it didn't work. They could have cut 10 minutes but they didn't. It was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house film.Now, a lot are asking, is Amber Heard in it? Well, yes. Did she have many scenes? Her presence was only about 15% of the whole film. Her character, Mera did play a pivotal role for the story but James Wan, the director knew when to show her on screen. The question, 'Is her presence important on screen?' seems like what James Wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in. She only had few dialogues but her performance was still flat.We also have a problem with how much they made use of 'space'. Especially in the first act, we saw they're a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots; the surroundings, locations or/and environments were only there because... they were made to be there. It barely did anything to the story. But when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras, the cameras ddin't give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals. A lot of mid to fast cuts, there wasn't much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built. In the end, we felt discontented.First Aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch. This time, the villain or again, villains were just forgettable. The motivations were weak. The main villain didn't really drive the story forward. It had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movie's existence. We couldn't care less because it's nowhere interesting, let alone enjoyable.And talking about that final battle... oh man. It was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable. Was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here? The whole movie, led to the final battle, it was a journey between Aquaman and his brother, only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for Aquaman and his weapon. It's just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overall.And the movie draggggggsssssss so much, we even questioned, 'What happened to James Wan?' From the beginning up until the climax, we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen, but it didn't. It drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then that's when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up. We're confused.Amidst these flaws, one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood. A beautiful message combo with good pairing, Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson have commendable chemistry, we can see it from the way they talk to each other. There's certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship. It's nothing that you can remember for years but it's enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to be.Ultimately, Aquaman 2 seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone, rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrative.Verdict: Similar to its predecessor, this sequel fails to find its identity, drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies. With a shallow story, forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing, this film struggles to stay afloat. While it's a tidal wave of disappointing results, the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon, carrying the entire movie. Overall, this final chapter from the DCEU serves as a testament we're in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes.~iamianiman rated 3/10 on 20 December 2023"," Ends The DCEU On The Bummest Possible Note: The most accurate word I can think of to describe Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is annoying. Where the first film was hardly a masterpiece of the genre I thought it was over the top in all the right ways and because of that I actually mostly enjoyed it. This movie just doubles down on the insanity in all the worst ways and I ended up finding it borderline insufferable.For the first 15 minutes or so I thought I could enjoy it in a so bad it's good sort of way but it's too stupid to even enjoy in that way. The script just makes so many errors on the most basic level that if you think about any thing about this story for more than a minute it just collapses. Nothing that gets set up pays off in any meaningful way and most of the resolutions fell totally flat. It can't decide on a tone, it drags majorly and most of the humour made me cringe in all the worst ways.The performances really suffer as a result cause they're pretty poor across the board. I've liked Jason Momoa as this character but he's just too campy in this movie to take anything he's doing seriously, even actors of Yahya Abdul-Manteen II and Nicole Kidman's calibre deliver their lines in the flattest way possible but with the material they're given I can hardly blame that on them. I'm happy that Willem Dafoe was spared from this mess at least.The finale is the most bog standard CGI noise of a climax that we've seen so many times before that I was just totally bored watching it, at least the first film had some sense of spectacle to it. There's the odd fun action scene but the pretty dreadful visual effects just constantly took me out of it. The villain is terrible after a decent set up in the first film with the most generic motivations possible.The Lost Kingdom ends the DCEU with the biggest thud imaginable. It's been up and down since the beginning but it deserved a better conclusion than the soulless slog that this movie turned out to be. This might be the worst movie they ever made because at least Justice League had a happy conclusion with the Snyder Cut. There's nothing in this movie you haven't seen 100 times before and I've never been more ready for a total reboot of this universe.~cdjh-81125 rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Wow, this was COMPLETELY awful: This movie feels like the equivalent of Eminem's Revival cause my god, this movie is a dumpster fire in the worst way with poor writing, sloppy characters, and bad performances. The first Aquaman movie is absolutely ridiculous but I enjoyed it because it didn't take itself too seriously and understand what the movie was. I thought it had a fun energy and went bonkers in the best way. However, all the fun, energy and bonkers entertainment is just thrown out of the window with this sequel because this sequel is a gigantic mess.The narrative continues from the previous movie with new settings and concepts introduced and while I did like they introduced new settings that are pretty cool. Unfortunately, the writing feels really convoluted because the concepts and ideas were messy as if the writers didn't know how to put the concepts well-together. With all the reshoots and drama happening behind the scenes, I can't be surprised that the structure had fallen apart. Many of the special effects, production, make-up, and the colorful presentation are pretty rough and there are some noticeable poor CGI used but not like The Flash situation. The soundtrack is annoying and the action and thrills were just okay. Many of the cast members are doing their best but unfortunately, the performances weren't great and the dialogue was pretty bad. I honestly feel bad for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II cause he's talented and the character of Black Manta is pretty cool, but Mateen doesn't really get his chances to shine with his character.Director James Wan is talented as I enjoyed many of his works and I can see Wan is trying his best to create the sequel like the first one, but his direction was really bad as it feels sloppy and inconsistent. The sequel tries to follow the same non-serious 80s cheesy style, humor and tone from the previous movie but it doesn't work because the sequel kind of misses the point of what made the first one entertaining and ends up being pretty cringeworthy.I knew this movie wasn't going to be great and I just wanted to have dumb popcorn entertainment. Some dumb fun and laugh for the cheesiness but wow, it surprised me on how bad it was.One of the worst movies I have seen this year. Also from DC.~chenp-54708 rated 1/10 on 22 December 2023"," Entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before: IF this was made in the early days of superhero franchises, say when Iron Man first came out, then it might have stood out. Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.James Wan doesn't offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there's such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.Jason Momoa's charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he's reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn't help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.I find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You've seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.Don't have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don't have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman's talent is such that, even small screen time doesn't stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.Which leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - ""do I live in hate, or do I forgive?"" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.I hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it's also a by the numbers' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember.~jayenjr rated 6/10 on 22 December 2023"," Aquaman and the ""LOST SCRIPT"": Rating: 5/10Format: Regular TheatreA script that doesn't have any story to hold it tight together. It's a very interesting story that discusses many aspects like family, brotherhood, fatherhood, and leadership. But, perhaps this was its core problem, that it was trying to be so many things at the same time. At times i didn't know where the story was heading which made the story jump from discussing topics like fatherhood to an adventure with two brothers who had beef in their past. The film is unfortunately a typical superhero film in terms of expecting what's coming next from events, and sequences.On top of that and with all the chaos, the film re-discusses the villain's story which revolves around his revenge but it was so weak comparing to how it was in the first film. I didn't feel his presence nor i felt his evilness. He was suppose to be much stronger here but i barely felt him. The film also brings back old characters that just all of a sudden showed up in some sequences to save the day and be the superhero of the act which felt so weird because they came out of nowhere.The film's CGI is okay at most times. It's defiantly not as good as the first one but it is for sure better than most of the MCU's latest projects this year like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). The cinematography unfortunately got downgraded which is something that I was anticipated for especially after seeing the first part. But I felt like there was no room for that because of how messy the sequences and story was especially that we were jumping between the past and present a lot and from one place to another.Not to mention, the whole last sequence of the film was so good in terms of the action sequences and grabbing the audience's attention. Really got me hooked and interested and wished if the rest was like that.~Aziz24 rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," Ended before the story started: How can a movie resonate with the viewer, if the story builds for two hours, and ends in 10 seconds? How can a writer think that this will have an impact on the viewer?Well, the film feels and looks like a comic book. It is an simple comic book storyline, It feels kinda like a saturday morning cartoon. This is a great look if you're going for an animated movie, but for a whole picture that is demanding towards older audiences.. this is a problem. An problem which Hollywood doesn't seem to care about. Because I've seen this in almost every high-budget adventure film this year.It is always the same structure. The Hero returns and needs to save someone or defend somewhere, one that is near to him explains that he needs to get to A because at B him awaits an creature, that is much stronger than him. So he needs to get an item, or in this specific case, get an person, that could help him. AND very important to note here, is that the villain always gets teased at this part as this demonic, highly frightening creature.In the end, he's mostly just an huge piece of plastic or an huge piece of Green-Screen. Or, the worst case, he dies in merely 60 seconds after his great appearance.While this kind of storytelling overshadows what audiences REALLY want, and what potentially great writers could achieve if there would be more demand for interesting, immersive concepts and ideas in Hollywood, at least, please, try your best in writing your characters Appealing.The first Aquaman is simple, it's basic, but in it's first minutes it's already emotionally resonating and has GREAT camera-angles that psychologically just attracts someone to stay for more. The movement of the camera was immediately grabbing. And in the end, you got an work of art which is intense, epic and emotional at once, just because the filmmaking does the best out of it.So, either have a great script, or have a great filmmaker, a great sound-editor, cinematographer, composer, color-grader, visual effects artist..Filmmaking is not without reason called an art-form.~hanschsolo rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Nothing Stands Out: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom seem to have taken a dive, leaving us with a rather soggy DC EU experience. Jason Momoa's Aquaman fails to make a splash as a top-tier superhero, and the revenge tour promised by Black Manta turns out to be more of a leisurely swim. Forget showcasing Aquaman's raw power; we're stuck with a neglectful father, husband, and king who happens to be proficient at water aerobics. The movie spends more time on side attractions like cinematography, visuals, and subordinates, forgetting that Aquaman should be the main event. With attempts at humor falling flatter than a sunken ship, it's clear they lost the recipe that made the first Aquaman somewhat tolerable. And seriously, a DCEU finale without a Justice League cameo? It's like they're drowning in missed opportunities. I'll generously give it a two out of five-mainly for the underwater scenery.~Entertainmentsparadise rated 4/10 on 23 December 2023"," Battle of the Tridents: I was a bit confused about Atlantis being somehow still hidden. I just thought everybody knew about with Aquaman fighting for the Justice League, which BTW is nearly non-existent in this feature except for a Ben Affleck cameo. Let's just pretend DC Comics decided to have its own ""reset.""With the help of a scientist (Randall Park) and global warming David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) discovers the existence of another Atlantis, or at least the broken black trident of the Lost Kingdom of Necros. Holding the two pieces together Kane is given knowledge to uncover the lost technology that Atlantis had abandoned because it was destroying their world by altering the climate. (See where this is going.) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) must resque his brother (Patrick Wilson) from the Harry Potter prison of Azkaban. They then must see a pirate who looks like Jabba the Hut. The nobody hits my brother line reminded me of Beverly Hill Ninja. I am not sure why they played ""Spirit in the Sky"" for underwater scenes as if I wasn't confused enough. Aquaman does have a son in his feature who can talk to fishes. I was disappointed it never came into play.Good action. Horrible script. Waste of money.~nogodnomasters rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023"," Anyone with a functioning brain, better pass this one by!: Only suited for energy drink addicted teenagers, who want to their movies to be like a nonstop action game.The bad: this movie is too violent for young kids and way too stupid for any grownup adult. That leaves only one target audience: the teenagers.Hurrah for them if they can stumach this non stop CGI rubbish, but I got annoyed and numbed within minutes of watching this.What's most annoying are the (failed) attempts to make jokes, that undeniably fail to evoke any laughter, AT ALL. The ""jokes"" are so worn out and in my face that they only irritated me.I really can appreciate a silly over the top action movie and the story hasnt even got to be credible, BUT at least the characters and the story should be interesting. NONE of that was the case however in this movie.To be avoided at all costs...~imseeg rated 3/10 on 22 December 2023"

Ironically, this fervent love and admiration for his father and family creates conflict between the father and son."," Can you really even call it a movie?: Technically, there was no cohesive storyline. Dialogues were all over the place. Conversations between characters were weird. Like every time one would say something and other would go into an unrelated monologue. (Mostly ranbir).It's nothing like the trailer. Story is not about son and father. They didn't show anything about their relationship after the first few scenes.Coming to content, Ranvijay never knew to answer a question straight. His character had no consistency. Even if you make a negative character, his actions need to be consistent. In one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesn't care, and then next instant he would forgive and protect them.A movie needs to have a story, a plot, characters need to make sense inside the movie.Their attempt at jokes were so distasteful. He gives a wedgie to a servant, rants about his underwear, there's two monologues about pubic hair, there's denial about medicine.Even the climax was so underwhelming. They just faught in one song.Worse part was how they used Sikhs in the movie. They tried to use them to do idk what. But they're just around to elevate Ranvijay. And in main climax they're told to stay back. Then killed on screen helplessly. Why would you show something like that.All in all, as a movie it sucks due to lack of story and badly written characters. Then there's the content.~sumi-mishra-789 rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," Such a shame for even animals to name this movie: Ranbir personal show with no story, no logic and absurd action scenes. Anil Kapoor and boby are wasted totally, the film story is from the age where there are no law and enforcement exists you can do whatever you want to either it's your own country or you are in foreign kill as many people as want .... to make a century of corpses is like a piece of cake. Zero emotions and no chemistry between father and son....not even close to a worst family drama and yes it's not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity. Spend 3.5 hrs with your father or if you are father spend quality time with your son and save yourself from this disaster.~ali-79-997033 rated 1/10 on 1 December 2023"," A film for the clinically insane made by a psycho: The movie glorifies violence, physical and sexual abuse, denigration of women and basically banks on shock value to provoke viewers rather than pull in people with a coherent story.The director will claim that he is some sort of indian tarantino, but its not even close. Just a badly made movie with a man whom every woman must be careful of and stay very very very far away. Consider this a warning and avoid this psycho and his movies. Nothing good can come out of them.Its specially troubling when you know that these movies will appeal to already mysoginistic men in India and encourage further crimes against women. Really feel bad for women who now will have to put up with more misogyny because of trash like this.~kothari-raunak rated 1/10 on 3 December 2023", Embarrassingly awful: Went to see it with my 2 boys last night in Manchester.What looked like an awesome film from the trailer turned out to be an awful experience. An embarrassment of 2023.Be Sharmi. Be hayaaii. Be ghairati. The Indians are fast losing their sense of identity as they try so hard to westernise themselves but none of the western world watches any of this kind of trash so why bother losing your authenticity?This film is a sex romp with a mindless and senseless killing spree. It beggared belief and on so many occasions we just wanted to walk out but hung in there hoping against hope it would improve.Ranvir Kapoor an excellent actor was unable to make the film look intelligent at all and a deaf Bobby Deol now looking aged was thrown in for good measure in the last 20 minutes. Anil Kapoor looked lost with the odd decent dialogue but nothing out of the ordinary.It was just killing upon killing with scenes and dialogues of sex that would make Bollywood no go films with your daughter or mother. Any wonder that Bollywood is dying out slowly and actors are out of work. Carry on with this trajectory and Hindi cinema won't exist in another 20 years as it will have lost itself completely.Distasteful. Disrespectful. Disgusting.~jabbarhusayn rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023," Probably the worst movie I've ever seen: You seriously need to question the sanity of the director, producers and even the actors of this film. I'm a bit traumatized by the movie, and Ive seen my fair share of gore. This movie was beyond bad. And the storyline defies logic which makes it even worse. Too many instances where basic questions and clarity in communication would've reduced the screen time from three hours to two hours max. The worst part is the director is planning on a sequel soon.If you value your hard earned money and your mental health, I would advise you to abstain from watching this 3 and a half hour torture of a film.~samitshah2 rated 1/10 on 3 December 2023"," Pathetically cringe, no closure except for boneheads lusting for blood: I have a migraine watching this cringe movie. Literally every aspect of this movie is cringe. And in terms of originality, this is Rajneeti meets Kabir Singh with an overdose of papa, papa. Give it a rest, you can love your father without being abusive to the rest of the world. And the great thing is that there is still no closure for the audiences who've been wound up for 3.5 hours in the hope of at least a detente.The 'visionary' directory Sandeep Reddy Vanga goes to town bringing every debunked cliche to life - the cliched 'alpha' shtick, the slap-happy father who favors the son-in-law over his own son, the subjugated wives and mother, the 1 'alpha' killing 100 of people (not an exaggeration) armed with a couple of axes, creating 'body doubles' as if that's a thing.The funniest part is that the climax fight with Bobby Deol literally has its own narration ongoing in the form of a song in the background - as if singing ""Ye dekho kaisa thappad maara~"" with every slap landed.No closure is offered to any of the sub plots ongoing with the protagonists - the relation with the wife, the kids or even the father. To compensate for this, Sandeep Reddy Vanga overcompensates with gratuitous violence to satisfy the enraged crowd watching this trash, never having been involved in as much as a scuffle, much less an actual fight.The plot is as simple as it gets, and it's clear Sandeep Reddy Vanga didn't have a story to tell, as much as a couple of ideas for scenes he wanted to execute based on his diminutive understanding of Marathi music, fetishization of Sikh Youth and culture and more importantly, his bloodlust to satisfy.Such is the bloodlust, that even the post-credits scene is drenched in more blood than most animes, and that's saying a lot.~bhimsenintellect rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," It was embarrassing to watch the movie after a point.: The movie is ridiculously bad. Keep the misogyny aside (which is absolutely horrid), the movie is still looks like a headless chicken running around. There is absolutely no story. I wanted to leave the theatre on so many occasions, yep, it was that ridiculous.There is such a lack of logic as well! Ranbir Kapoor is in supreme health just a short while after getting a HEART TRANSPLANT and beats the hell out of Bobby Deol. Ranbir is killing 200 men alone while his Sikh brothers are singing in the background. Heights of stupidity.Please do not watch the movie and give it attention that it clearly does not deserve.~tanvidavid rated 1/10 on 5 December 2023"," Worst ever movie!: When we make a female lead movie, everyone labels it as a feminist movie. But even then those movies just portray how a woman challenges society and comes forward in life. Society can't accept even that and rates the movie so low. Then what about this nonsense movie. Is this not a misogynist movie. How many movies like this are shown to insult women and objectify them. Why is no one labelling such movies as misogynist when it actually is. Why are we still showing women as objects in such kind of movies. What is it with movies like Kabir Singh and Animal. This movie is so disgusting, it shows how ranbir is in real life. Look at the movies alia chooses and look at the movies this useless fellow chooses. He either chooses a playboy movie or a movie where he objectifies women. Poor alia to be married to such a misogynist.~abilashsubramani rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," Disappointing: ""Animal,"" directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, offers a captivating experience with impressive background music, memorable songs, and technical finesse. However, the film stumbles in terms of story strength and screenplay execution, featuring temporal shifts that lack coherence and fail to enhance the narrative.While the first half engages with its fast pace, the second half unnecessarily prolongs the story, leaving the film feeling overly lengthy and lacking character development, especially with Ranbir Kapoor's character. His abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning, contributing to a disjointed narrative.Despite a touching emotional scene between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor towards the end, it arrives too late, leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure. The credit scenes, though appealing, add to the film's unnecessary length.Ranbir Kapoor's character, portrayed as a hero, raises concerns due to his criminal actions, lack of respect for others, blatant misogyny, and attitude problems. The film's attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic, as it glorifies a man-child who in reality needs therapy.Actress Rashmika Mandanna's performance is very poor, making her unfit for the role. She was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayal.It's disheartening to witness Bollywood failing with films like ""Animal."" The industry has the potential for impactful cinema but seems to fall for subpar narratives. They should strive for better storytelling and more nuanced character portrayals and should avoid the pitfalls of glorifying problematic characters for the sake of entertainment.~asadkhan0810 rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Absolute wild animal: Man.

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.~kevin_robbins rated 5/10 on 20 November 2023"," Long, Boring and not needed.: No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.~skylermoore rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023"," Not On Par: In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.~Tweetienator rated 4/10 on 21 November 2023"," Welcome to the 10th Annual Boring Games... I mean Hunger Games: I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.~nscoby93 rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Incredibly faithful to the book: Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.~vitordrios rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Prequel that tries to show some of the history of the fictional world, but remains somewhat unnecessary.: The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 4/10 on 19 November 2023"," A sure misfire!: I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.~gabriel-80 rated 5/10 on 15 November 2023"," This certainly does not catch fire.: It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Disappointment: I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.~ArchilArjevanidze rated 3/10 on 17 November 2023"," Pleasantly Surprised: I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews.

New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 25 June 2016"," Now I Have a Machine Gun, Ho-Ho-Ho: In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.~PredragReviews rated 9/10 on 5 May 2016"," Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre: Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 15 May 2010"," THE best action flick ever !: ""Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister."" Well, what else can I say besides that this is ""THE"" (can't stress it more) action movie from the 80's with a young Bruce Willis. Personally, I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie. ""Die Hard"" remains an example for all action movies that followed. At that time you had the Sly and Arnie action movies. But these were more a performance of brutal violence, with big muscles and a sense of invincibility. Bruce showed a clever, shrewd, caustic action hero, who can take a beating, but on the other hand shows that he's not completely invincible.Of course, the action in films nowadays is much bigger, more impressive and mind-blowing, but the strength of this film is the story, the accumulated tension, lightness and the dry humor of Bruce Willis. From the first minute he takes you in his grip, and he won't let loose. You see him slowly evolve from a wrinkle-free clean-shaved top cop into a reasonable damaged hero. This pattern keeps coming back in the next two parts, which are also top movies of the same caliber.You'll notice this is already an old movie because for instance lighting a cigarette in a public place isn't prohibited. But how the action scenes are imaged, is still top-work and should be the aim for many action flicks.I think the sudden confrontation between Gruber and McClane is one of the strongest scenes in this film, along with the well known ""Yippie-kay-yee"" cry. Trademark of Willis. The fact he likes the character of McClane a lot, you see clearly in ""The Last boyscout"". In that movie he plays an impoverished detective with the same coolness and cynical, dry humor as McClane. Too bad that in the last two Die Hard movies, McClane is only a shadow of himself like in the original movie.""Die Hard"" is one of those rarities in movie land, which you can watch without thinking ""Pfft Again this movie"". It remains, for me, an enjoyment to watch.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT~peterp-450-298716 rated 9/10 on 9 September 2015"," ""Welcome to the party, pal!"": (In brief)By any measure, ""Die Hard"" was a pretty muscular movie back in '88. It made cultural icons out of its two stars and the explosions were guaranteed crowd pleasers. The script (note-perfect) ran like clockwork with setup-and-payoff and was stocked with memorable characters throughout; the hero reluctant and vulnerable, his stakes ever ratcheting, while the action would just keep mounting until . . . Well, there wasn't any more opulent high-rise. It doesn't matter what time of year you watch this movie, it functions perfectly in July and December (or even today, so close to Halloween) and always his the spot. It's the ultimate ""You can't go wrong with"" movie.(Less brief)After twenty minutes of story setup, BAM! The guns start blazing and the death toll gets going. At a certain point, this just becomes kind of a theme park ride as John McClane scrambles through the bowels of Nakatomi Plaza and everything's raining down around him.McClane is the key to making all of this work after all. He's the ideal rally-behind character, neither hulking nor shredded and always thrust into a fight; and Bruce Willis is working at peak likability. But he's matched by Alan Rickman, the master scene-stealer, as devilish as they come. It's a rivalry commensurate with such a big movie.And McTiernan's the perfect director for this gig. His direction is self-assured, his camera calm and measured. Sure, we're confined to this building the whole time, but the audience had plenty of moments to take a breath and soak it in. Put it this way: can you imagine someone like J. J. Abrams helming this? Stock up on Dramamine first.I can go on and on, but the bottom line is this: ""Die Hard"" is just *fun*. There's joy in the gunfire, personal injury and wanton property destruction. I always feel great after watching this.~Mr-Fusion rated 10/10 on 30 October 2022"," Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.: Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10~Robert_duder rated 10/10 on 7 February 2007"," Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre: In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line ""Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er"". The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss.~Screen_Blitz rated 9/10 on 3 December 2015"," Ladies and gentleman, Mr.Bruce Willis, Movie Star: DIE HARD (1988) **** Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, Hart Bochner, Robert Davi.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company.  As the "" fly in the ointment"", Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away.  Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.   Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office!  Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. ""Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!"" (Dir: John McTiernan)~george.schmidt rated NA on 6 March 2003"," The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time: Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.~ivo-cobra8 rated 10/10 on 4 February 2018"," Iconic Action: The ultimate combination of action, crime and Christmas, Die Hard is timeless in its appeal. Willis is the perfect casting in his most iconic role of McClane, with Rickman the faultless foil, as the equally iconic Gruber.Not only is the action explosive and pulsating, but the wider cast of characters also get some form of arc, fleshing them out. Dialogue is great (even if the German may be a bit off), and the setting never tires despite being restricted within the single building.Big budget, all-out action and perfect one-liners, all in one festive present.~deepfrieddodo rated 10/10 on 5 December 2021"

Enough said.: Almost 90% of characters, including the antoganists, in Salaar praise the Hero for what a great destructor he is. The value of each character in the movie depends on how much of an extreme buildup they give for the Hero character.""He did that"",""He will do that"",""Until he asks, the Sun won't rise"",""He is here, the universe is watching with fear""""He is a dinosaur resurrected in human form""and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on.You are already tired. And, this is also already a sign of worst things to arrive and they do arrive with full force. Every scene the hero Prabhas is shown it comes with some epic music as if a war was just won. Every single thug with a weapon is beaten to pulp by the Hero. No need to mention, with bare hands. No matter even if the warring group holds in possession of modern war tanks and kalashnikov's and standing right opposite the Hero with an intent to kill, the hero kills each one of them with a machete.In one particular scene, the Hero is on the verge of killing an important character, all the 50 odd army men around him falter simultaneously in loading their rifles to shoot him. Yep, not a single one. Everyone drop their bullets or guns slip from their hands. All 50 falter loading the damn rifles at the same time. The Hero is let to finish his killing job at ease. That is how a great fighter the Hero is. Or, how cheaply incapable the villains are.Final thought: DON'T WATCH THIS PATHETIC THING.~XboxWon rated 2/10 on 30 December 2023"," A Dinosaur which barely breaks the ice: Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.~sujanfaster rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," * Film Injected with Over Mass Elevation but not having enough impact for the goosebumps: ***Salaar Movie Review ***Directed by Prashant Neel starring Rebel Star Prabhas in the lead. Also starring Prithviraj SukumaranPrashant Neel's KGF, this was the reason for watching Salaar & an expectation that there will be link of KGF and Salaar but the later is not there.Coming to Salaar, the movie had given mass moments but it's kind feel of over injection of mass elements which creates a disinterest in watching.Prabhas had given the best with his swag and the way he delivers the action but a viewer who watched Yash in KGF, the same goosebumps is not having when watching Prabhas in Salaar. The background music had been used extensively to elevate the mass sequences which clearly gives an indication that its intentionally made.Prithviraj had given a decent performance.The last 30 minutes filled with action was interesting but when deep driving in the second half, many times the screenplay had been accelerated thereby a lot feeling that something is not going as per it is required.The core of the movie is similar to of KGF. It's about the POWER but Salaar had expressed in through the mode of friendship & violence..There will be a lot which needs to be unboxed in Part so Part 1 is an above average flick for me.~skmenon1993 rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," Ugramm on steroids.: Devaratha (Prabhas) and Varadha Raja Mannar (Prithviraj Sukumaran) are best friends in Khansaar. Circumstances lead to Deva and his mother leaving Khansaar and living in exile, moving from city to city. Aadhya (Shruti Haasan) comes to India without informing her father and her life is at stake. Deva is assigned to safeguard her but he has to do it without his mother's knowledge as she disspproves his violent side. Protecting Aadhya pitches Deva right against Varadha and things aren't the same among the two friends turned foes. What happened to them in the world of Khansaar is something one is expected to watch in part 2, instead this part is about showing glimpses of where Deva had been and not what he did. Adding to that there are a bunch of baddies in Khansaar and the place's bloodied history connected to Deva.Prashant Neel has reworked his script of Ugramm in a much grand way, going all out in building a new world called Khansaar, just like he did with Narachi in KGF. That justifies him resorting to KGF narrative style for Salaar as well with his trademark quick cut aways and non-linear narrative with constant hero elevations. There are actually four of those in this film. The entire first half is dedicated to introducing and re-introducing Prabhas's Deva. Bigger canvas meant the mother - son segment taking a bigger hit and Neel has not been able to effectively crack it this time around. This is made up for by the terrific pre-interval action block and Prabhas's towering screen presence is put to good use even though his performance remained one toned. It is the entry scene of Prithviraj Sukumaran which had an impact.The second half is exclusive to establishing the world of Khansaar and it's several provinces as right from the King to the several lords are introduced along with the constitution of their own. This is where Salaar takes the bigger deviation from it's source material. The pace does get slow but the ones acquainted with KGF films, know exactly what to expect. The high moments are few but when they arrive, they explode. Asusual the final 15mins leads to an action segment giving both male leads equal opportunity to shine. Neel has kept majority of the story to be reserved for the sequel and this slightly disappoints. The final reveal is good enough to keep the intrigue for the sequel but barring those couple of scenes, the film's narrative is rather flat.Overall, it is not an exceptional intro though it succeeds in generating interest for the sequel. I am going with lenient rating due to the efforts put in to create this world and giving deserving Kannada actors a bigger film to showcase their acting skills.~chand-suhas rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Salaar: A Prolonged Odyssey with Moments of Attraction: Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.~NARCISSISTIC_CINEPHILE rated 6/10 on 22 December 2023"," Loong & booring: Prabhas can't act ofc. If you're not from andra, he is a below average actor. KGF 1 & 2 had us routing for Rocky bhai till the end with great storyline & soundtracks but Salaar lacks all this. Prabhas face looks so bland and emotionless throughout the movie, keep in mind that he was paid 100 crores!!! He just appears tall and big. Thats all. Prashant Neel kept on saying that this movie is full of drama rather than action and I feel like he was taking a safe route because he knew there's no way Prabhas could reach the audience as a true action hero like Rocky bhai. Tbh I fell asleep after the interval and was looking at my watch to see when this movie would end. Just a waste of time and money. Andra audience ofc will hype this up as much they can but the reality is prashant missed it this time.~MatthewKay007 rated 2/10 on 23 December 2023"," Too much Hype: I went to watch this movie for Prashanth Neel believing that he would do justice but I came out very disappointed. Too much build up , too much hype and too much slow motion scenes. Anything that is more than the necessity made this movie a disaster. At a point i felt sleepy when there was only information being passed for too long and suddenly there would come a build up with a bgm to just keep us awake. Half of the movie was filled with slow motion which felt like it was prolonging the scene. Prithivi Raj and Prabhas acting and screen presence is great but that alone is not enough for a movie to be successful. It is another downfall for Prabhas.~akil-vijay11 rated 1/10 on 23 December 2023"," A good comeback for Prabhas.: I wanted to give 8 stars but there are many in the review section purposefully giving 1 stars even though they haven't watched the film.. all are drowning in ego and forgot at the end of the day it's an Indian cinema....Positives in the movie is cinematography, huge story line and even background music, linke in kgf this time Ravi Basrur's bgm didn't overshadow the dialogues, and I like prithviraj sukumaran's acting more than prabhas but Prabhas is playing that kind of role who talks less one who watched Ugramm will realise thatComing to the negatives- Ugramm's influence is the problem here especially kannada audience feel it as a old food in a new plate, but those who didn't watch Ugramm may like this film and another major drawback what I think is under utilisation of prabhas and less screen space....~sagartiptur rated 10/10 on 23 December 2023"," It is a waste of time: Please don't fall for hype. . We wasted our time. Direction is horrendous, they show part Europe and part some kgf kind city. Nonsense to the core. Why can't they get good story. Who said bloodbath means story, no goosebumps. I believe they have paid for these reviews. The actors just stand stiff and do nothing other than cut body parts, movie does not make sense at all. The movie makes bo sense in many parts. The hero is kept in prison but comes out and beheads a guy in front of everyone. He first begs him to kill him and although there are people with guns all around they do nothing. It makes no sense. This is a very bad movie, please stay away from the hype and paid elements. For Prabhas this would be the end of the career so they are making sure it works. But the movie is bad.~ramanb-b rated 1/10 on 23 December 2023"," A Hollow Spectacle: Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.~magadalwarmayur rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"

That said, its 2023 and almost everything has been done already, so the real question is this. Is it well done this time? Is it fun? And the answer is yes.The movie take a bit of inspiration in True Lies but put its own spin on family road trip comedy with some ""We are the Millers"" vibe, while injecting some decent action sequences in there.Having a runtime of 2 hours make sure the movie put enough emphasis on the familly relations and developing its characters, wich can be a definite plus, but at the same time i felt the movie dragged a tiny bit in the first half. Maybe 10-15 minutes could had been cut. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment.Mark Wahlberg is definately in pretty solid shape still, wich make his character completely credible, but he ain't no martial artist so seeing him go toe to toe with Lateef Crowder (a Copeira expert) did showcase some of his shortcoming. That said, that scene was meant as a mix of comedy and action and not to be taken too seriously so for most peoples who are not martial arts afficionados, it should not be a problem. The rest of the action including gun scenes were well done.Michelle Monaghan is also pretty solid in her role as the mom of the familly. Charming and charismatic. The kids also got to have enough screen time and developement that they felt usefull and interesting in the story. Every character pretty much as its own arc.Overall its a movie that i taught was pretty enjoyable on a first watch. It is a mix between comedy and action but at the same time since it never fully commit to either side, you can't say its a super funny comedy or a big action movie. It is a bit of everything and it makes for a good story tough.Ultimately not every movie is meant to be watch multiple times and considering Apple TV+ has a pretty limited selection of mainstream original movies (Ghosted being one of the few great ones), it is a welcome addition that both casual viewers and cinephile should enjoy.~destroyerwod rated 7/10 on 16 December 2023"," Great action comdefy: While this is not a movie where you'll be amazed by the plot it sure delivers on both action and comedy fronts and sometimes that's all we need from a movie: to spend a good time laugfhingh and see good action.A popcorn movie? Sure, but in a wold where,m save a few exceptions, most movies are very slow burns with crap characters only defined by their gender or secuality I'm just hjappy to see a movie that is just a movie.It has heart too, Michele Monagan never disapoints and even Mark Whalberg does a hreat job as the father figure.A fun ride throug and through, jighly recommended in these dark times as we all deserve to crack a laugh.~angladafrank rated 7/10 on 19 December 2023"," Leave Logic At the Door And Enjoy Your Popcorn: Here is a mess of a movie. It's frankly absurd.

It's ridiculous, sometimes annoying, and has poorly written bad guys. The plot is whatever you want it to be. There's no real story here. Just go with it. Pop your popcorn, add lots of butter and push play on your Apple remote. It's 2hrs long but don't panic. You'll survive.~FreakingMovieFanatic rated 8/10 on 17 December 2023"," Cute movie: This was a cute movie, where Marky Mark (also producer here) is in a physical shape that is truly exceptional, and married to a beautiful wife with only a very civilized age gap. There's product placement, but not too much. There's staggering violence, but it's all squeaky clean so it can be a Xmas movie. All the supporting cast is ethnic just the right amount. The family is flush with tremendous cash, which helps plot advancement as well as beautiful cinematography / scenes.It was very enjoyable, assuming enough suspension of disbelief. The whole thing is obviously very predictable, but it's executed nicely. Everybody but the teenage daughter is world-class level at something, so while it's promoting family values, it is, for a change, not promoting mediocrity.I watched this while cycling indoors, was perfect to get me through my winter workout.~roxlerookie rated 6/10 on 16 December 2023"," True Lies meets National Lampoon's Vacation: So there was some money left and no ideas. How easy is it just to remake a high scoring film but without the large budget. This is so copied from True Lies, even the main character has the same job and there is also the evil Asian woman. The ending with a show out against the baddies in an empty building, same. Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment.~hansefde rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Silly but well made, engaging, emtertaining feel-good actioner. Unadulterated fun.: In silly but well made, engaging, feel-good actioner ""The Family Plan"" Marky Mark Whalberg lives a blissfully quiet (boring) life with wife Michelle Monaghan & kids Zoe Margaret Colletti, Van Crosby & baby - who know nada of his previous life as an assassin... until the goons of his ex-boss Ciarán Hinds find him, forcing him on a cross-country road trip (in which he battles them while hiding what's happening) to a glitzy Las Vegas showdown (which goes on a tad too long). It's pure entertainment with no deeper value, but all performances are pitch perfect, David Coggeshall's screenplay is solid, and director Simon Cellan Jones splendidly pulls it all together. It's unadulterated fun.~danieljfarthing rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not out of the ordinary, but entertaining...: I liked this. But....It is ground-breaking in concept? Absolutely not.Is the story something unexpected? Nope.Is Wahlberg's acting better? No. Same old Marky Mark,It is cliché? Definitely.However, it is entertaining.I wasn't watching the clock during it or pausing it repeatedly. It held my attention in spite of a rather expected storyline. Action sequences were decent. And Monahan always does a good job. So in spite of some viewers complaining it's not the next great blockbuster, this film still delivers on entertainment.And while her part is VERY minor.. love me some Maggie Q.Minuscule adult oriented content (one, rather tame, scene), no nudity, very light on foul language. Violence is the greatest aspect - and due to the violence, I'd not suggest this for younger viewers. It's NOT a ""family film"" due to the violence.-----------------All that being posted.. and irrelevant to the actual storyline... it was VERY strange to see these optics from an Apple film... all these henchmen chasing down this white suburban family are black. Seriously, ALL the low-level street henchmen/killer were black.. the race dynamics were so, so prevalent they were readily apparent to me. And honestly, that's rarely anything I would notice.~NullUnit rated 8/10 on 19 December 2023"," Popcorn movie: I give this an 8 not because it is a great movie but, within its ""True Lies"" genre, it delivers. I tend to get bored with non-stop action movies that spurt blood constantly and have no actual human characters. While it's improbable that the average middle aged couple look like the two leads and the whole thing is completely unbelievable, it at least paints an outline of characters and the cast is kind of lovable in their own tropes. Adolescent angst, mom boredom - yeah, it's a bit pain-by-numbers...but it flew past and I didn't check my watch or wonder when is this gonna end already??? - which is about 90% of the time with the crap the streamers make. (See ""Leave the World Behind - no, honestly don't -should've been on the Sherwin Williams channel 'cause it was like watching paint dry!!). You want art? Go to a museum. You want to enjoy a little mindless entertainment with high production values and a pretty great pop soundtrack (yes!

Nothing is special from this film presented by Apple. Mark Wahlberg tries his best here but can't save this film from sinking even though he stars and is a Executive Producer on. What is also dissapointing is the acting is very bad from everyone involved which is a surprise especially since this is a solid cast. Without spoiling to much of the plot point this reminded me of a cheap knockoff of True Lies in a way. You will know what I'm talking about when you watch this. The Family Plan gets failing grade from me with 4 stars out of 10.~djrmc24 rated 4/10 on 18 December 2023," Another generic movie, why??: A completely cliché kind of movie: Some teenagers that are of course always in bad mood change into good kids while a James Bond imitating Mark Wahlberg safes his kidnapped family cause, you know, he was a killer. And how does his family react: Omg he is a killer! But wait we are family, so we need to love him right?Sorry for that but I can't endure anymore movies like The Family Plan.Mark Wahlberg's time is over, I don't even know when the last good movie came out with him starring. Apple wanted another movie (not that they made two movies over the last months for cinema) so the writers thought: wow let's make a funny romantic family action road trip drama movie, man I don't even know how many genres we want to integrate into this movie but it's gonna be awesome! And I have to say the first act isn't that bad. I quiet liked it actually, even if it was a little bit brainless. But what followed was a story that couldn't have been more boring. I don't want to see the classic ending shot where the protagonists walk out of a building with the police already waiting. I want to see a story with twists and turns but besides some left and right turns on the street the movie had nothing like this. If you read reviews to get a recommendation, then I have to disappoint you, cause I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. Thank you.~ItsRobinTV rated 5/10 on 17 December 2023"

Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic).

Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending.~MissSimonetta rated 9/10 on 3 December 2023"," Maybe the best Godzilla movie since the original: I'm a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great ""monster"" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)4) Shin Godzilla (2016)5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)~druss44121-1 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," OUTSTANDING: This is an exciting film. The pace, story, imagination, production are all done expertly. Dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles. I wish I could comment on writing but just be assured that despite my remedial Japanese (and a range of inconsequential translation departures the I detected), the cast's ability to convey agony, loss, hope, love, fear, and anger was appreciated, even with its 'just-right' dose of melodrama. Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity. It makes you fall in love with the characters.Then with perfect timing, reflects the singular and exquisite quality of the Japanese people; their acute sense of the cost of war and their abiding commitment to the future.Because of that, there is nothing in this film that I can criticize.~rhmacl rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," This is what a Godzilla is supposed to be: From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie. It kept everything that I loved about Godzilla, and was able to make an extremely interesting backstory with the human characters. There was a lot of things that was addressed in this movie that I had never seen before.there was so many things that people will pick apart, but that's upon reflection. I had no criticisms or a reason to dislike this movie the whole time I watched it. So, in that respect, I will give it a perfect score. And I don't go slinging those out just every review. As a Godzilla fan, this was perfection to me.~dormantgene rated 10/10 on 30 November 2023"," A Masterpiece Retelling of a Classic: Godzilla Minus One is an amazing spectacle on a retelling of a classic Kaiju movie from the prospective of a post-war Japanese veteran who leaves one horror for the next while making an arrangement of ""friends and family"" along the way.

The classic Godzilla sounds design, masterful cinematography, along with the original score from Akira Ifukube made this movie an absolute masterpiece on storytelling!

It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.~tyzilla-02450 rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023," This is one of the best iterations of Godzilla I have ever seen, and I have seen them all: I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.~sheridan-turner rated 9/10 on 30 November 2023"," Very good surprise: Finally a Godzilla movie with interesting and developed characters, for this point it's certainly the best of the franchise.(Spoiler part) I also thought the death of one particular character was really surprising... Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title ""Minus One"" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's ""Subarashiki nichiyobi"" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.~koroxx rated 9/10 on 3 November 2023"," Go See This Movie: After the brain cell killing abomination known as Godzilla vs. Kong, the monsterverse was ruined for me. I also found the movie Shin Godzilla to be kind of boring. I have yet to watch that movie and not fall asleep through it. So when I seen Godzilla Minus One, it blew me away. It is easily one of the best Godzilla movies out there. At least in the top 5. I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget. I am in no way interested in seeing Godzilla x Kong 2, but I would gladly see what Toho has in store for THEIR upcoming monster movie projects.~bak-67163 rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"

She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana's old age in all of it's demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It's too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the ""in your face"" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT. Even an adventure needs some serious notes, to be more credible. And by the way, I am not a kid anymore and so arent many other Indiana fans!5 Steven Spielberg didnt direct it.But James Mangold did and whoever googles Mangold's Imdb carreer, soon will find out this director has made some fabulous movies. I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps.

That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.~thejefflewis-92228 rated 6/10 on 1 July 2023"," Had it's moments, but did this really need to be made.: I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end.~DarkVulcan29 rated 6/10 on 30 June 2023"," A Muddled Misadventure: It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 6/10 on 17 July 2023"," Not The Final Indiana Jones Movie I Wanted: I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment.~slightlymad22 rated 6/10 on 28 June 2023"," Lacks The Spielbergian Magic Of Its Predecessors: The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering.~CinemaClown rated NA on 3 July 2023"," Indy's farewell fares well: Greetings again from the darkness. ""They look like snakes."" It's such a simple line of dialogue, yet after 42 years and four previous movies, we know exactly what that means to retiring archaeology professor, Dr. Henry Jones, best known to all as the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. As the final chapter of the beloved franchise, this entry is the first one not directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg (listed here as an Executive Producer). Instead, James Mangold takes the reins, and also shares writing credit with his frequent collaborators Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth, as well as ""Indiana Jones"" veteran David Koepp. Of course, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman receive credit for their original characters.Harrison Ford once again dons the familiar whip and hat, and at 80 years of age, still possesses the screen persona and magnetism that first won us over in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The extended and frenetic opening sequence finds a young Indy (Ford is digitally de-aged for the sequence) at the tail end of WWII fighting Nazis over what else, a prized ancient artifact. I'll leave the specifics to those who watch the film, but just know that it's an interesting historical choice, and also one that matters little in relation to the enjoyment of the film.Working alongside Indy in the opening sequence is his pal and fellow archaeologist, Basil Shaw (talented character actor Toby Jones, who seems to be in most movies these days). However, the fun part for me is seeing Thomas Kretschmann and Mads Mikkelsen share scenes as Nazi Colonel Weber and Dr. Voller, respectively. These are two of my favorite actors and I do wish they had a couple more exchanges ... although Mikkelsen's character gets significant screen time and plays a crucial role in how the story unfolds and concludes (he is also digitally de-aged for the opening sequence).The story picks up with modern day Dr Voller and his band of misfits tracking down the relic and disturbing Dr. Jones' retirement party. It's at this point where Indy's Goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pops up creating a three-way battle for the priceless relic. This sets off a chain of events that leads them on a global trek to desert, sea, and hallowed cities of antiquity. Helena's partner in crime is young Teddy (Ethann Isidore, sporting a Bob Griese Dolphins jersey), who is clearly the scrappiest of the bunch. Dr Voller's troupe includes Shaunetta Renee Wilson as the misguided Mason, Brad Holbrook as sleazy Klaber, and Olivier Richters as one of the largest bodyguards you've ever seen.Fans of the franchise know that the story is secondary to the characters and action, and there is no shortage of action on speeding trains, galloping horses, motorcycles, tuk tuks, vintage airplanes, and scuba dives. Antonio Banderas shows up as a boat-owning old friend of Indy, but it's the appearance of series favorites John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and Karen Allen as Marion, that generated cheers from the audience. Ms. Waller-Bridge holds her own with screen legend Ford, and it will be interesting to see the career path she chooses after her success on TV and now film. At times this feels like a live action cartoon, and that's not meant as criticism. It's pure fun, fantasy, and adventure cloaked in nostalgia; and the film is a fitting conclusion to a world class franchise.Opens in theaters June 30, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 29 June 2023"," A legend will face his destiny: I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too.~Cinema-reviewer321 rated 6/10 on 7 July 2023"," I'll never understand the hate.: I understand some of the criticisms I've heard surrounding this final Jones outing; it's burdened by a handful of excessively bizarre ideas and an overabundance of characters.But one criticism I'll never understand is that this is somehow disrespectful toward the Indiana Jones character-that it belittles him or mocks him in some way. I could not agree less with this.What I saw today was a film made by a director who understands, respects, and loves this character. He crafted a hearty adventure story that adds depth to Jones and sends him off fondly.Indiana and Helena are characters that are both shown to be capable, intelligent, and protective and they both save each other quite often. They are introduced as closed-off but they wear each others' emotional layers down over the course of the story in subtle, natural ways that really did affect me and make me feel something.The film is shot and directed immaculately-the action is brisk yet hard and thrilling. Sure, the story's ambition requires a LOT of CGI, and it's more noticeable than it should be at times.But that didn't stop me from loving the film because the script is smart, constantly shifting power dynamics and developing character to keep you invested in the world.This is leagues better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I really hope people avoid the hate train that's been building online and give this last adventure a chance in theaters.~benjaminskylerhill rated 8/10 on 30 June 2023"," I liked everything but Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Very Minor Spoilers): The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was.

Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.~prberg2 rated 5/10 on 30 September 2023"," The Creator uses its budget masterfully, but it's not without its problems: This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.~poseyfan rated 7/10 on 29 September 2023"," What's it all about, Alphie?: The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.~BA_Harrison rated 5/10 on 27 September 2023"," Lots of stuff happend then it ended: I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly.~Jim_Screechy rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Technically Watchable but Emotionally Vacant.: Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.~kgprophet rated 5/10 on 29 September 2023"," Typical and formulaic: Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)~FeastMode rated 4/10 on 28 September 2023", Stunning visuals/Garbage Script: With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at.

The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.~davemanson rated 4/10 on 11 October 2023," The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element: My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 September 2023"," State of the art effects, but more holes than Swiss cheese: Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.~Lomax343 rated 6/10 on 28 September 2023"," By the numbers take on man vs robots dystopia: AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.~alex_with_a_P rated 4/10 on 1 October 2023"

I honestly took a step back when I first saw this. I am ALWAYS extremely critical of movies lately, especially since recently Illumination, Disney, and even a recent Dreamworks movie have fallen flat, but wow!This is truly a family film that is appealing to ALL audiences. Kids have laughs at gags, adults have entertainment from parenting and general themes, and they even poke fun at grandparents, who still are made out to be cool and fun-loving by the end.From both a filmmaker and huge movie fan's perspective, it is extremely refreshing to see a kids movie have good values, no explicit themes, and still be very entertaining! The story and plot was well worked out and everything made sense. The music was fantastic (a solid original score, no spammed pop music like most kids movies). The animation was adorable and very enjoyable to watch. It was also super refreshing to see new/underground talents showcased! A lot of less known names but a fantastic job done (especially the voice actors)!I'm really impressed and wish to express from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making such a great family film, creating a safe space for families to enjoy a movie without oversexualized themed, over the top toilet humor, extreme violence, etc. 9/10!!!~joe_jr rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," A production that makes the most of its potential and successfully achieves a story of family unity and dignity.: ""Migration"" is an excellent animated film whose script tells a story with familiar and educational touches, setting an example of dignity towards immigrants, all from the perspective of the ducks. The animation is tremendous, resulting in beautiful visuals, as well as amazing character design. The voice work of the actors is perfect, giving charisma to their characters and highlighting their personalities. The editing work is highly successful and intensifies the drama and comedy when they are required on screen. A production that makes the most of its potential and successfully achieves a story of family unity and dignity.~jp_91 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," Lots of family fun, sit back and enjoy: This has to be one of the better kids animations of the year or even a few years. It isn't pretentious and doesn't bang on the drum of morality. Rather its pure fun and hijinks.It starts off with the dad trying to scare the kids out of ever wanting to leave the pond, but in a very fun and funny opening. All is good for over protective dad until some exotic ducks land for a stop on their migratory flight south and fill the kids and mum with ideas about migrating to Jamaca. Dad tries to stop but is convinced to overcome his fears and take a chance.And that is the only moral part of the story, take a chance in life and face your fears and prejudices.From there on it's one rollercoaster of aride with lots of fun bits.Also, unlike a lot of animations, you aren't playing the game of oh that is such and such voice. The only really recognisable voice is Danny Divitto, who is perfectly cast as grumpy uncle Dan. The kids are relative unknowns but are perfect in timing and emotion.The animation is colourful but doesn't overwhelm the film either like some animation do.It also isn't overly long which is great and kids will love it and parents get lots of laughs.Yes it's not ground breaking but that's not the point.A perfect family fare, perfect for Christmas/ holidays.~reeceagland rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Migration"": A Heartwarming Animated Adventure Packed with Laughter and Life Lessons: I couldn't resist the chance to watch ""Migration"" ahead of its Boxing Day release date. From start to finish, my love for ""Migration"" only grew stronger. The film is an absolute delight - it's not just super cute and funny, but it's also packed with heartwarming moments that tug at your emotions. The characters bring such warmth and charm that you can't help but be drawn into their world.Beyond the humor and cuteness, ""Migration"" delivers a great message to stop waiting for life to happen to you. The animation is nothing short of fantastic, bringing the story to life with vibrant visuals and captivating sequences. ""Migration"" is a perfect blend of laughter, heart, and visual brilliance that makes it a must-watch for animation enthusiasts of all ages.~cutie7 rated 7/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not Half Bad: Overall, not a half bad illumination movie.The movie's environments were beautiful. Easily my favorite part of the movie. I loved the watercolor-esque trees. Also, the designs of some of the humans, especially the main antagonist, are pretty nice and creative. The jokes weren't nearly as ""cringey"", and landed for the most part. (hah, get it, cause the movies about ducks... migrating). The humor in this movie feels more family-focused, rather than purely for the kids.As for the negatives, the story is fairly linear, and not too interesting. The overall theme is very obvious, so it isn't too deep. All in all, a typical illumination movie.Overall, a decent Illumination movie. Just plain family fun. If you want to be fairly entertained, and laugh with your kiddos, this is a good movie.~OddityReviewsStuff rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre: I recently watched the movie Migration (2023) in theaters with my daughter. The storyline follows a northeastern family of ducks 🦆 who encounter a flock of migrating birds that invite them to fly south for the winter. Despite their usual winter stay, the family convinces the dad to fly to Jamaica 🇯🇲 this year, and an adventure ensues.This movie is co-directed by Benjamin Renner (Ernest & Celestine) and Guylo Homsy (Eddie's Life Coach) and features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Danny DeVito (Twins), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians), Keegan-Michael Key (Wonka), and Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games).The animation in this picture is outstanding, while the rest of the film is fairly average. The storyline is straightforward, with a few worthwhile subplots. I particularly enjoyed the husband and wife working together through various circumstances for the betterment of the family. The voices are well selected, and Awkwafina and DeVito comedic content keep the film well-paced. The conclusion is as expected, though its sequel potential remains uncertain.In conclusion, Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 December 2023"," Great for adults and kids - clean and entertaining family film: The animation is colorful, action starts relatively early and is well spaced-out. The jokes were appropriate. My kids are aged 10 and 14, they both enjoyed it. There were kids of all ages in the theatre and I could hear laughs all the time. Perfect for the holidays and also has a great soundtrack.The storyline is obvious in the title, but the journey was full of surprises enough to keep you on the edge. There were useful lessons to be learned and a morale to the story.The last film I had seen at the cinema was Super Mario and ""Migration"" has delivered the same clean family entertainment that we have been missing.Highly recommended.~m_al_saeed rated 10/10 on 16 December 2023"," Suprisingly decent: I went with low expectations about this film because the trailers looked like the movie wasn't good, but after watching it i can say it's really worth the ticket.Visually there's nothing to complain about here the ducks and all kinds of birds that appear here look nice and are really expresive.Soundwise nothing outstanding, decent, you can hear every character clearly because all was mixed well. The ambient for all scenarios is done pretty well too (Swamps, cities, forrest)Storywise This is what i liked the most because it's not that dumb for an illumination movie, it has drama and funny moments throughout the entire run, but nothing too deep, just enough to be entertaining.I would say if you go alone or with your family you'll have a good time.~mackarron rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Migrate To This One With Your Flock! Capital Fun That Just Needed A Bit More: LIKES:Good Pace-The movie doesn't get lost in sitting around and stewing on the adventure, but rather gets the world established and ready to leap into the adventure within about 15 minutes-Once they take off, the movie keeps to a good pace that is fun, well-timed, and never getting too stuck in one place that it becomes too boring or off-putting of the story-And yet, the movie doesn't do the Fast and Furious approach of putting the petal to the metal and flooring through it to cram jokes.-Instead it does a nice job of giving that adventure nature and still respecting the character development and plot to help make this a movie that is far above the Nick Jr. And Disney Jr. Elements.Fantastic Animation-It might not be the highest grade in terms of realism, but Animation still shows how other studios than Disney can make cartoons come to life.-Ducks fly and soar in the style that mimics the natural movements of the ducks and other birds, in their steps, dives, and swoops. It's great attention to detail and part of the magic that animators make.-then comes the human elements in their forms, and what a surprise to see such great adaptations in the small fowl forms is humorous , charming, and just cute at times and brings the energy that this movie thrives on.-Wrap this all together and the smoothness of the animation is going to easily keep your eyes on the festivities of this dynasty in their migration to whatever they are searching for in their journey.-And the design with that goofy look on their faces that Illumination does adds more than takes away, sort of a subtle level that adds funny with little effort.Great Humor-A staple to these movies for me is to laugh and hope that I get more than just kid humor and cute sound effects and one liners.-Migration had my back and did not disappoint with the material presented and more so how appropriate it sticks to the rating they gave it.-Yes, there are plenty of the tropes for kids, silly smashing, lots of random lines, and annoying sounds that are going to be repeated.-Yet, the movie feels a bit like Bluey, actually geared towards adults with plenty of their perspective to help color this film in a shade that was far more enjoyable-Bed time stories gone wrong to help make a point, sarcasm that just sticks and matches the emotion so well that the combination of visual and sound are unbeatable for me.-And there are even a few jokes hidden within that for you to enjoy and find, that little extra sauce that makes this movie fun for all.-It's also balanced and well implemented, never getting to lost to overshadow everything else this movie achieves, again a part of the fun, not the whole fun that still gives an engaging story.The Opening Short:-It's of course geared to the Despicable Me audience, but the small tale and short is very fun and a little side story that curbs you to the Gruniverse.-I enjoyed the simple tale that bridges the gap, adds that silly level of humor found in that movie franchises, and was a nice bridge to warm us up.-One character is a surprise to see, but with them comes a funny Looney Tunes like motion that was very enjoyable, if not a tad long.Family Friendly, But Adult-This movie again can mirror the craze of Bluey in my eyes.-It's family friendly, easily watchable by all ages, but yet not so juvenile that older adults are going to be looking at their phones or fingernails to entertain themselves.-That humor I mentioned is one element, but the fact there are such great storytelling elements and character development really help make this movie easily more entertaining and relevant to the masses.-To have that balance helps really give the movie rewatchability to see what else you can find with the wit and cleverness of the animators' imaginations.Good Character Usage-And again, a good movie is loaded with engaging characters, and even more so using those characters to justify their inclusion is big for a reviewer like me.-Migration again succeeds in this task, granting you characters that are colorful in look and design, but also in personality and story.-The main flock is of course the stars, but surprisingly there is a lot of secondary characters that get some fantastic screen time, with a purpose and engagement that just doesn't tag them along for the ride.-The antagonist might not say much, but it doesn't matter, because even he has enough merit into his inclusion, and enough menace to fit in without being too much.-It's impressive to see them do this where others struggle, but applause for what hey crammed into about a 90 minute run time.Voice Acting-The crown jewel for me is the voices that brought so many characters to life and delivered that comedic punch with the haymaker that had me laughing.-The writing might be good, but I loved the execution as well, with just about everyone delivering solid performance.-DeVito needs more lines, but what he pulls off is perfect for the curmudgeon duck, with just that touch of dry sarcasm and lack of energy that is balanced so well.-Banks was that calming factor, her raspy and controlling voice a nice contrast to help calm the theatrics of the comical birds in this movie, and add that touch of different humor to the mi to help keep things diverse.-However, it is Nanjiani that was the best. His voice was made for an animated dock, so aggressive, high pitched, raspy, and that element of awkward composure that makes the humor so fun. And yet, still has the air of caring that leads to a great character that I enjoyed watching across the board.DISLIKES:More Needed-The adventure was great, but again, there seemed to be more needed to finish this migration to the South.-This film did the trick on many levels, but at the end of the movie, the adventure seemed to end a little faster and quicker than I expected.-Surely more things could have been done, or maybe not skip quite as much and lead to three minute montage to get home, especially given one last fun thing that could have been that last touch.-Throw in some of the other characters getting a little more development given the trauma they faced and well... I kind of would have liked to see that execution.-Minor to some, and moderate to others, a little more engaging design, even at the cost of the short, could have helped take this a bit further.Gwen Gets A Tad annoying-She might be the most adorable character, but it doesn't mean that she was my favorite.-Gwen's whininess at times is cute, but often is annoying to me, the high squeals, the excessive jokes of embarrassment, and the impatience just grating my nerves.-Her humor is definitely more like a kid focus approach and at times it works, but it was much lost on me and she gets a tad overwhelming for someone like me who just doesn't enjoy bratty kids.More Character Development-It started so well and I think that the movie kept most of this up, but... again there was still some elements that needed tinkering.-Some more challenges and merit to take the ducks to a new level and help them not have such an abrupt change.-In this type of movie, it's not quite as important to the key demographic, but with just that touch more story building could have taken this to the level of some of my favorite movies.The VERDICT:I really enjoyed my time with Migration, and found this animated feature to be quite engaging for me and many of the members in my showing. The animation is solid, cartoony and goofy, which works to capitalize on the writing and humor loaded into this journey. With that balance of adult and kid, the movie caters to all ages and should assist with making a movie that should keep the attention for the 90 minutes. A sensational voice cast and lots of time with the characters, only further brings out the fun and I really just had a fun time soaring through the skies through this quirky little family. Sure, more development could have helped add that added spice, and there could have been a few more engaging challenges and less Gwen. Yet, the movie still shines as an entertaining piece and I encourage this one in theaters for a fun outing, or at the least a watch at home.My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0.~rgkarim rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," Cute but trite: Been there, seen it.

I'm not sure it's deserving of cult status, but don't ask me why, I have a feeling that in years to come, this may well develop something of a following.The clue is in the title, Violent Night, and boy this film doesn't hold back, in terms of violence and manner of deaths, this film packs a real punch, you will see all sorts, people dismembered, shot, impaled, it really doesn't hold back.If Santa did actually pop down for a visit, I can imagine him being this disillusioned, this irritated, with a genuinely low opinion of people, this is where the film scores in my opinion, the performance of David Harbour, who is genuinely very good.Enjoyable music throughout, good special effects, plenty of action, Violent Night was a Christmas surprise.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 6 January 2023"," This Santa Dies Hard: Possibly the most tedious film question ever asked is, ""is Die Hard a Christmas movie?"" Violent Night says ""what if Die Hard WAS a Christmas movie?""Its an excellent mix of two genres. First and foremost it's a (very violent) man in a tight spot action movie but hidden beneath is a traditional Christmas story of people becoming believers and a jaded main character getting their feative mojo back.The film success is largely down to David Harbour's fantastic turn as a disillusioned St Nick. His ability to project charisma even when appearing tired and fed up carries the day, or in this case, night. He also cleverly avoids the trap of playing Santa too dark, for all his boozing and necessary killing he is still recognisably Father Christmas. The rest of the cast are all decent as well, with John Leguiziamo making a fun villian. Even the child character manages to not be annoying, although some of her dialogue hints that they had originally wanted a younger actress than Leah Brady.The other big plus Violent Night has is its, well violence. The set pieces go above and beyond, with villians being impaled, burned and dismembered. Highlights include a Home Alone inspired sequence (turns out the invaders in this film are a lot less durable than Harry and Marv) and a Mortal Kombat worthy finish to the final showdown. There's also a decent vain of comedy even if you won't exactly be guffawing in the aisles.There are a couple of things that take you out of proceedings, like the bad guys refusal to just shoot their guns and some very generic family interactions, but overall Violent Night is a very fun couple of hours.8 lumps of coal for 10 naughty mercenaries.~danchilton-71955 rated 8/10 on 30 December 2022"," Die Hard Santa: This movie is a beautiful mixture of Die Hard, Home Alone, Thor... It also contains several cliches from other movies. Not a problem. Yes, it's predictable, but it is kind of different of what we usually recieve on Christmas, and I personally appreciate different movies.First, action, gore and scenarios are great. Also the main cast. I think almost everyone here does a great job. I really enjoyed music used here too. Great choices.Second, the script is predictable but at the same time, it keeps you entertained from beginning till the end. Raw action mixed with some goofy scenes.So, overall if you want to watch a different brutal action Christmas thriller, this one is for you.~danielcereto rated 7/10 on 25 December 2022"," Exactly what you'd expect.: And there's nothing wrong with that.When Violent Night is good, it's really good. It isn't always nearly as entertaining as it could be, but it definitely capitalises on its goofy premise in all the right ways at various points.The violence is blunt and rudimentary, but there's something strikingly effective about it. Each hit is loud and visceral, and many of the actual deaths are a lot more creative than I was expecting them to be, even if the violence leads me up to each death is pretty by-the-numbers.I was pleasantly surprised with the small but satisfying character arcs that the script weaves into the simple story. Santa is given a cynical outlook on humanity and himself to overcome, the family has tension to work out, and the mythology of Santa's backstory is actually given a twist to make his capacity for violence make sense in this movie.There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about any of this, but it's all crafted with care and it's investing enough that I could easily see myself watching this in subsequent years.Its aforementioned strengths help it largely overcome its weak supporting actors, dialogue that's sometimes so corny it's cringey, and its few too many scenes of characters sitting and talking.~benjaminskylerhill rated 7/10 on 2 December 2022"," Brutal delight: Such a wonderful spin on a horror/comedy where Santa Claus is the hero! David Harbor is absolutely perfect for this role has the best voice and great thrill to see in anything he's in! To me this is one of the best Christmas movies out there along with Bad Santa. I would defiantly agree with anyone that loved Violent Night, it's a great mix of Home Alone, John Wick, and any horror Christmas movie. Tommy Wirkola directed a pure blast of entertainment! I sorta can see how it could get hate the family was a little obnoxious at times but I void that out cause everything else positive outweighs heaps.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 December 2022"," Santa's got a brand new bag: Greetings again from the darkness. HO-HO-HO! Who is ready for the best ever Santa slasher movie? Admittedly, it's a narrow sub-genre and anyone that knows me or reads my reviews, knows full well that this is not the type of movie I typically recommend. However, it's the season for charity and director Tommy Wirkola (HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS, 2013 - sequel in the works) and co-writers Pat Casey and John Miller (the screenwriters behind the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" films) have gifted us an extremely violent and often very funny Christmas present, replete with a sledgehammer-slinging Santa Claus.We first meet an inebriated Santa (""I'm on a break"") at a local pub, where he explains to a mall Santa why he has become so disenchanted with the job ... greedy, self-centered kids who only want more video games. The booze numbs Santa's disgust as he heads off on his sleigh ... and Wirkola delivers the first shocking moment as Santa's barf keys us into the type of twisted tale we are about to experience. David Harbour (best known for ""Stranger Things"" and HELLBOY, 2019) is absolutely all-in for this far-from-glamorous portrait of jolly ol' Saint Nick. On his rounds, Santa raids household liquor stashes while chomping on cookies and eschewing skim milk. He's a full-blown slob, yet still holds a soft spot for ""nice"" kids, while having little mercy for the ""naughty"" among us.Most of the story takes place at the Lightstone family compound, where one-percenter Gertrude (CHRISTMAS VACATION alum Beverly D'Angelo) is the foul-mouthed matriarch ruling over her entitled and unlikable family consisting of daughter Alva (Edi Patterson) and her airhead-actor husband Morgan (Cam Gigandet) and their poser teenage son Bert (Alexander Elliot). Also present for the festive evening are Gertrude's son Jason (Alex Hassell), his estranged wife Linda (Alexis Louder) and their precious 7-year-old daughter Trudy (Leah Brady). Santa arrives at the Lightstone mansion not long before a team of mercenaries, led by Mr Scrooge (John Leguizamo), storm the place and take the family members hostage. Their mission is to break into the family vault and abscond with $300 million in cash.What follows is a demented mash-up of DIE HARD (1989), HOME ALONE (1990), BAD SANTA (2003), and THOR (2011). Deadly weapons used here include your expected firearms, but also a finely-honed candy cane, an icicle, a skating shoe, and a Christmas tree star, among other holiday items. Most prominent is the sledgehammer wielded by Santa, and the flashback to his pre-Santa days for explanation. The violent action is plentiful, and it's well-balanced with countless lines of comedy. Surprisingly, there is a story nestled in amongst the mayhem, and the heart of it revolves around the bond between Santa and young Trudy. She's a true believer in him and that overrides his uncertainty about the job, and inspires him to stick around for the fight. Santa can't explain the mystique of Christmas ""magic"", but he does know an 1100 year marriage has its ups and downs.Obviously, this is not one for the kiddos (it's a hard R-rating), and they should be shielded from this Yuletide yuck. Director Wirkola has delivered an instant holiday classic for those seeking the bizarro world flicks contrasting to the more respectable family fare of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS STORY. Who would have ever thought that Festivus might be the safer holiday?Opens in theaters on December 2, 2022.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 30 November 2022"," Santa Wick: The first movie I watched in the new year, 2023. I regret not seeing it in the cinema. I really liked the movie. It was fun. It's like a family movie though, with lots of bloody scenes. There was a lot of inexplicable stuff about Santa in the movie. This shows that there will be a second movie. According to me. Acting was good. David Harbor was great again. I liked the movie overall, except for a few cringe scenes. The action scenes weren't bad either. It was a funny movie. It was a movie that didn't take itself seriously, but took it seriously at the same time. I recommend. It was one of the best movies of 2022 for me.~jack_o_hasanov_imdb rated 7/10 on 31 December 2022"," Violent Night is a modern Christmas classic!: If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Violent Night is one of the biggest surprises of the year, instantly becoming a contemporary Christmas classic! David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal, savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messages.Fighting sequences feature truly violent practical stunts, taking advantage of the R rating to provide unmeasurable amounts of gore. Creative use of Christmas songs will leave audiences crying with laughter.A brilliant homage to the seasonal genre classics that should be seen in a packed theater!""Rating: A-~msbreviews rated 8/10 on 30 November 2022"," Definetely how I like to start the season.: As far as Christmas movies go, is this better than Die Hard? Of course not! However, it's no doubt a Christmas movie. David Harbor plays a Santa Claus who lost his Christmas spirit and gets it back by going total medieval on a gang of kidnappers looking to take a small fortune from the type of rich folks you hate the most over the Holiday season. Harbor's Santa reminds me a lot of his version of Hellboy, I think when it comes down to it both pictures are Metal as Hell, and it's like Mr. Stranger Things just doing vocals for both albums. Mr. John Leguizamo is in the flick as the naughtiest of naughty men (not as naughty as Hans Gruber, but who can be). Like a sick guitar riff Leguizamo brings his season experience as an actor to create an interesting and funny bad guy. Leaning towards the Home Alone factor, this movie is as violent as the title suggests, which is rare, really. The little kid in turns out to be worse than Kevin McCallister when it comes to projecting her home from criminal masterminds. It's like someone read the minds of every person that watches Die Hard on Christmas day and just wanted to give us something official. I appreciate that.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 2 December 2022"," Great execution of a beautiful idea: Violent Night may be just 10 mins too long but thankfully that doesn't stop it from executing it's beautiful premise extremely well. A super violent and really funny action movie that doesn't forget to bring the necessary heart and festive spirit as a Christmas movie.David Harbour gives a terrific lead performance as Santa, displaying an emotional range way beyond what's expected and delivering some truly heartwarming moments with Leah Brady who brings a boundless optimism to her adorably innocent character.Tommy Wirkola's direction is great, the action scenes are so much fun to watch, really inventive and always comprehensible. The music by Dominic Lewis is really good, combining the epic action movie pieces with more traditionally festive moments.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 3 December 2022"

It oversells the opening credits death of his son. While I understand it's the crux of the motivation, we get 30 minutes of his suffering before he decides to do a thing. Feels emotionally manipulative, wringing every last drop of milk from the tragedy to the point where it can't be called a fun action film in the least. The entire film is dialogue free, which works for him since he loses his voice, but becomes a big, dumb gimmick as every character in the film is given an excuse not to speak. One is gagged, one cries and texts the entire film, one is simply quiet and stoic and the rest grunt and groan to fill the gaping void. So finally, after a long cliched montage of him body building and gun training (and why he needs to be extra ripped I don't understand, but I'll buy it). He has a year to plan the perfect revenge and what does he do? Drives up, makes a lot of noise, makes every mistake imaginable & is constantly getting beat up and luck saves him every single time. Bad guys aim for his bullet proof vest over and over again, they give him long cool looks instead of just shooting him as he loudly makes himself an eye sore in every situation, never using even the smallest amount of stealth. He decides not to shoot a woman who just unambiguously just shot at him to kill him, which obviously doesn't go well for him. He tells the bad guys he's coming for him and is surprised that they best him. The lead bad guy decides to dance with his girl for like 10 minutes in slow motion as he is killing all his guys in what is possibly the most over decorated art direction ever in a movie... his lair looks like a groovy Los Angeles art installation or something meow wolf would dream up, hardly a gang member's decorating style. He sees his son in things and plays with his toys over and over stopping the action in its tracks. And finally, why are all the gang members cliches from 1990's movies? Why are they squatting and squaring off in abandoned ruins of buildings? Don't they have anywhere better to be? This movie was a boring, ridiculous, mess. John Woo tried his best to make it interesting visually, but the hyper style that worked in films like Face/Off never stops and makes it feel even more dramatically over the top.~actaction rated 4/10 on 6 December 2023"," Not impressed. Pretty action visuals, but severely lacking in real thrill and credibility: Director John Woo got world famous for his fabulous action visuals during the nineties. This picture still looks the part, but that is about the only positive I can find...The bad: the action only starts after 50 minutes. Besides an action packed opening scene of a few minutes no thrilling action to be seen during the first 50 minutes.Is the action any good then? Well yes and no. As I said before, the action looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame. Credibility near zero.More bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork. And although there is one big, bad crime guy who was supposed to be the ultimate evil, but he wasnt impressing me either.I had hoped for a thrilling action packed gangster movie, but it was quite a bit of a dread to watch though...~imseeg rated 5/10 on 4 December 2023"," No dialog absolutely ruins this film, among other things: I respect John Woo's decision to try to make a film with no dialog and the story to be expressed through his imagery rather than a script. The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen. I'm going to rewatch Face/Off to make me forget this film ever happened.0.5 shots in the neck out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 2/10 on 5 December 2023"," Why the bad reviews?: I'm not sure if the reviewers watched the same movie as me. I found this film packed with cool stunts and action sequences. I got both John Wick and The Raid vibes while watching it. Some scenes even reminded me of something out of GTA V.Even though there wasn't much plot in the movie and no dialogues whatsoever, I think the film is carried forward by Joel Kinnaman's excellent acting. Not many big action stars could pull off the same.All in all, I found it an entertaining and excellent action film. Just switch of your brain and enjoy it. I'm probably going to watch it again. I'll rate it 8/10.~allankaaber rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Action speaks louder than words: This being a new action movie directed by John Woo is what got me interested in the movie, along with it being a Christmas action movie starring actor Joel Kinnaman; other than that, the fact that main character loses his voice is what also got me interested on how the movie was going to go. The Christmas action movie Silent Night (2023) is a fun by the numbers revenge film that has good performances, good cinematography, and fun action; the movie is not perfect, because of how it could take the premise farther or impacted the character.Joel Kinnaman gives an exceptionally satisfactory performance not saying anything throughout the movie because of his character losing his voice and gives a lot of facial expressions to show what he is feeling right in the situation, with an occasional raspy yell and talking with his wife by texting at one point. He gets revenge for his son being killed, and there are a lot of moments where you can tell he is upset and is reminiscing everything he did with his son; most of the movie is him getting ready to put his revenge into effect, which was cool to see, and him getting info on certain gang members for the police to turn in. I would have liked if him losing his voice effected his revenge plan in a way that makes sense, so there was a bit more suspense in a way when he is trying to communicate with other people to help them in certain shoot outs.The antagonists are just standard gangs on the streets that are there to be killed in many brutal and bloody ways that are fun to watch; the action sequences are mostly well shot with particularly good cinematography like with shoot outs and car chases, but some action scenes could have reduced the number of cuts that were used. What I thought was impressive was that there are no lines of dialogue from every person throughout the entire movie, except in radio transmissions and in small whispers at times; I like how it focuses on facial expressions to get character's feelings across, but I would have liked some dialogue from the side characters since the main character cannot say anything.I can see why there are people who will hate this movie, but I thought Silent Night (2023) was a fun action movie that had an impressive performance from Joel Kinnaman, and well-done cinematography in the fun action scenes; there are issues like it being like all other action revenge movies, but it is entertaining to watch. Director John Woo has done a respectable job directing, and if you like him as a director, I recommend this movie; not a must watch, but it is a fun Christmas action movie to watch whenever you get the chance.~Cinema-reviewer321 rated 7/10 on 24 December 2023"," Should have been better: Watching John Woo's ""Silent Night"" and as much as I hate to admit it, I'm kind of bored.Also, the lack of dialogue from ANYONE is just weird. Sure, he can't talk due to being shot (it's in the trailer, hardly a spoiler) but the others haven't been shot. Having no one else speak just takes away the impact of the MC losing his own voice.I'm also struggling with the fact this guy has zero training but thinks he is going to take on the whole criminal underworld - training himself with YouTube videos in his basement.I guess, all I'm saying is, if you want a decent ""You shot my kid, I must kill you all"" revenge film - check out Kevin Bacon's ""Death Sentence"".~shawthingproductions rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," An unfortunate misfire: I hate to say, I'm overall disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy this but it fell flat for me. I figured John Woo going back to straight up action will be a treat. Instead of using the idea of a dialogueless action flick as an interesting device he creates a very drab story that is less than appealing. He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up. It's like he never watched a silent movie and saw how you can tell a compelling story with minimal dialogue. He just leans on lame cliches. Also there's too many logocal errors, even for an action movie. And Joel Kinnaman, who I normally like, makes a less than appealing protagonist. Even without speaking his character seems annoying. An unfortunate misfire from something that had a lot of potential.~bpete333 rated 4/10 on 8 December 2023"," Mute. Pause. Hit. Repeat.: SILENT NIGHT (2023) ** Joel Kinnaman, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Kid Cudi. John Woo's disappointing action revenge flick with Kinnaman seeking vengeance on gangbangers who accidentally killed his son on Christmas has so much potential but is squandered in its hole-laden script by Robert Archer Lynn (i.e. Namely the sadly misused talent of Sandino Moreno as the spouse who basically just passively cries while her husband for months on end is holed up in their basement preparing for war). While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job). A few decent set pieces sadly cannot make up for a half-baked update on DEATH WISH and its ilk.~george.schmidt rated 6/10 on 8 December 2023"," This is not up to John Woo's talent, and left me very dissatisfied.: This is not up to John Woo's talent. I found the material entirely like a one-trick pony. All rage, and sadness, verging on insanity, without any real character development, or pathos. There is nothing in the lead character's story that allows the audience to sympathize with him, other than the loss of his son. There are no positive events to draw us into the story. Instead, we are faced with an ever-increasing level of horror, rage, and madness. Woo has been known to give violence an almost ballet type of choreography (Bullet time slow motion) but that is not what we are seeing here. With the rage of the main character, we are faced with depression, rage, and madness which causes an ever-increasing degree of violence that continues to the very end of the film. This film should have ratings of extreme violence attached. While I watched the entire film I was left with a deep feeling of disatisfaction when it was over. It almost feels like the film was only part of a story.~lenwenzellw rated 4/10 on 20 December 2023"," Subverting Your Expectations (for the worse): I saw this movie for free and still wish I had not.Every trailer that I saw for this movie alluded to this being an action packed revenge saga. However, you get a taste of action within the first 7 minutes or so and then you have to wait approximately 60 minutes for your next dose and even then, during the last half-hour, you get maybe 15 minutes of action. So, out of 104 minutes you get 22 minutes of action.I do not like being lied to about the type of movie I am going to see and you probably would not like that either so I am trying to help you out here. What I would like to see is this movies gross drop off of a clip next weekend because of their deceptive practices.The soundtrack was garbage and forgetable (those songs I do remember were trash and those I don't ... well I guess I forgot).You want to know what else is forgetable?

The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 10/10 on 23 May 2022"," This is slightly different to the other reviews, please stay with me here.: If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.~scottedwards-87359 rated 10/10 on 26 May 2022"," Best Sequel yet: In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.~GusherPop rated 10/10 on 25 May 2022"," This is why we go to the movies: This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!~dtucker86 rated 10/10 on 27 May 2022"," Let me just say...: I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.I was wrong.~lovefalloutkindagamer rated 10/10 on 26 May 2022", The real cinema experience!: If there's any movie that deserves to be seen in the theaters with big screens and booming speakers.

I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.~r96sk rated 9/10 on 25 May 2022"," Flying High: Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past.

This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 23 November 2023"," An interesting failure: Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.~petra_ste rated 6/10 on 3 December 2023"," My biggest disappointment this year: Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.~MissSimonetta rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep: Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better.~Vic_max rated 6/10 on 22 November 2023"," Knew it was Bad. Even so, Surprised at HOW bad.: I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.~levybob rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Awful.: What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.~krzysiektom rated 2/10 on 26 November 2023"," Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies: Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up.~epicking rated 3/10 on 23 November 2023"," BAD, REALLY BAD, TERRIBLY BAD, AND I WILL EXPLAIN: First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.: Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.~dhunjiwadia rated 5/10 on 26 November 2023"," Bring on the director's cut!: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.~zeki-4 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"

It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place.

Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.: Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.~dhunjiwadia rated 5/10 on 26 November 2023"," Bring on the director's cut!: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.~zeki-4 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"

There's also some wonderful location work too, they really did make use of several world-wide locations.Archie Madekwe does a great job as Jann, he puts in an excellent performance, you really do see the young man develop and grow through the film. Always good to see Bloom, and he played the part well, David Harbour was excellent I thought, he added a lot to the overall story.Is this the most random soundtrack ever, I never thought Kenny G, Black Sabbath and Enya would feature together in the same cinema, let alone the same movie.I never thought I'd welling up over a bluebird, but there you have it, there were one of two very touching scenes.Hard to imagine it's based on a true story, but credit where it's due, it translated into a fine movie.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 9 August 2023"," Saw this in 4DX, blown away!: I'm not a gamer, I have an old version of GT kicking around I may have played last 5+ years ago, but no matter, what an incredible true story this was! I had no clue this actual story happened, and as far as true-events films go, this is right up there with the best. It's a true underdog inspirational story that was cast perfectly, and filmed just as great, with stunning effects, visuals and camera work. The pacing and story-flow was just right, in that the 134 min runtime flew by quickly. Watching it in a 4DX theatre added to the experience for sure. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. Now I just may have to go find that old GT game and throw it in and go for a spin.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 27 August 2023"," Knowledge of the game is a plus, but this is not a video game movie.: Here's The 4K Lowedown on the advanced screening of ""Gran Turismo"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)Release date: August 11, 2023Genre: Drama/SportMy Score: 8.4Cast=6 Acting=8 Plot=9 Ending=10 Story=8Interest=9 Script=8 Cinema=9 Sport=7 Triumph=10A struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.""If you miss a line in the game, you reset...you miss it on the track, you could die."" I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. I think you have to at least have knowledge of the game to appreciate the cinematography, but this is not a video game movie. It checked all the boxes for me with the action, racing, and the triumph over adversity. This is definitely worth a watch and was a good change of pace after watching Oppenheimer.~lojitsu rated 8/10 on 25 July 2023"," I expected little and was blown away!: I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, except that it was based on a video racing game. To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation.With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport.The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy.Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a cliché because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived.The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless.The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily. How did this have so little buzz and anticipation before it was released?~andydavis-19959 rated 9/10 on 30 September 2023"," The video game movie streak continues!: I watched Gran Turismo early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. For some perspective, I've never watched professional racing or played Gran Turismo. And I'm generally not a fan of based-on-true-story against-all-odds movies. They're usually all the same.The reason I say all this is to illustrate that the movie had to be really good to win me over. And it definitely does. Even though it goes through many of the same motions as these types of movies, it does it all so well. I was fully invested in the story, the characters and their outcomes. My crowd was really into it as well.I can't speak to how the movie translates the game, but they creatively incorporate some cool visuals. It helps it feel like a video game movie as opposed to a movie about a video game. The race scenes are awesome, you really feel like you're there. I like the cast, with the two leads being the obvious standouts. And there are some really heartfelt moments.I had a great time with Gran Turismo. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a premium screen (IMAX, Dolby Atmos, etc). I think most people will like it, gamer or not, race fan or not, old, young, etc.(1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 7/24/2023)As a side note, I'm really hoping we've turned a corner with video game movies, similar to what happened to super hero movies in the early 2000's. I really enjoyed Sonic 1 and 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in contention for my favorite movie of the year.There is still so much potential. If they continue down the super hero path, then someone like Christopher Nolan will take a property and show what can truly be done. My dream would be for Metroid to be the Dark Knight trilogy of video game movies.~FeastMode rated 7/10 on 25 July 2023"," An underdog story full of momentum: Gran Turismo is a terrifically executed sports movie, fizzing with energy and momentum from start to finish.It follows the story of Jann Mardenborough, a gamer who always dreamed of becoming a professional racer. Thanks to the Gran Turismo academy he suddenly finds himself with a chance to make his dream a reality. It's a wild story and the fact that it is based on real events is astounding.Even though the real events are unbelievable, the story beats are all pretty familiar and follow the usual sports movie formula. There's the underdog, the jaded mentor, the belligerent rival, the customary montage. None of this is ground breaking but it is all well presented and packaged up. The fact it is based on real events adds that bit of extra excitement and besides, who doesn't love an underdog story?The direction from Blomkamp is crisp and clean yet also energetic and chaotic, which makes for a visually engaging film. You really feel the excitement and thrill and danger of the racing, which was crucial to establish and get across, and was handled well.In terms of performances, Archie Madekwe is a really solid lead, bringing a strong emotional presence and charisma to his character. David Harbour brings his character to life perfectly with a thoroughly engaging performance, and Djimon Hounsou is a scene stealer with some of the more emotional baggage.I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but I was impressed! It has an unbelievable story to tell and it does it very effectively. A lot of it feels quite derivative of the underdog sports film genre, but the great direction and solid performances raise this film up above many of its peers, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining movie.~ethanbresnett rated 7/10 on 7 August 2023"," Wow! way better than I expected!!: Well, I love the game, so I knew I was going to go watched it, and it's really good if you are a fan of the game. The idea that you can make playing Gran Turismo so real that you would get recruited to drive an actual race car like it was your PlayStation is a Gamer's fantasy and it comes alive in a movie that's not a fantasy but a legit true story.Gran Turismo has got everything you need dramatically for a sports movie. The Trailers leading up to this film don't do it justice. It's got far more heart to it as it unfolds an amazing underdog story.Like the game it's based on it showcase every aspect of racing but now with a more personal touch.It's no Need for Speed but it's one of the best games adapted to a movie ever.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 10 August 2023"," Are video game films starting to be better?: Went into this not knowing the background of this film but came out pleasantly surprised with a great race car driving film but also a great video game film.If it weren't a true story, the concept would have been cool but definitely not believable and therefore no where near as good as it is.The racing and the direction taken to display the races was particularly impressive and at no point was it unclear what was going on. The acting was ok to begin with but got better as the film went on, especially with the emotional scenes. For me Harbour was the best actor in Gran turismo.The script was fine but did it's job well of portraying the stakes in high intensity scenes.Not really too much to fault as a true story racing film.~burntoutboy rated 8/10 on 7 August 2023"," Fire the Marketing: What an absolutely fun romp of a movie that was done a great disservice by its advertising campaigns. Unlike its very bad marketing would have you believe this is a great watch with an engaging story, anger inducing antagonists and some amazing acting performances, David Harbour is especially good as Jan's main guy. Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere. Overall though, it's a great watch and I would highly recommend you ignore the trailers (that give away a weird amount of the plot) and go watch this film.~taylormellors rated 7/10 on 7 August 2023"," Didn't expect it to be this good: Gran Turismo (2023)Racing games are probably my least favorite because I get enough road rage in real life. However I do enjoy an occasional well made racing film like Ford vs Ferrari or Rush. Even though Gran Turismo is a highly popular video game, or racing simulator, this film is NOT a video game adaptation because quite frankly there isn't much to adapt. Instead, it's simply an underdog story that involves a video game and the impact that it had on real life events, kind of like what the film Tetris was. However, this one is quite an unreal story and the entire time I couldn't believe that these events actually occurred.The movie is about an expert Gran Turismo player named Jann. He is considered to be the failure of the family as all he does is play video games but one day, he receives an invitation to participate in an online race. The winner of the race will get chance to compete for a spot to become an actual racer for team Nissan. Sitting with a controller is quite different from being behind an actual wheel of a 300 km/h car and soon enough Jann and other competitors will realize what they signed up for.I know some people have been criticizing the start of the film but for me, it was one enjoyable experience that kept getting progressively better. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the sports drama genre but it takes on an intriguing true story and executes it well. The video game inserts looked good and the actual racing scenes very exciting to watch. David Harbour put on an impactful performance of an inspiring aged mentor who gradually passed down his wisdom to the young and inexperienced protagonist.From the negatives, the editing looked slightly weird at times but it didn't take away from the experience as the action and drama scenes hit home. The fast paced story kept me excited the entire time and I remember holding my breath more than once. Whether you enjoy good underdog stories, play racing games or like cars in general, you are going to have a good time in the cinema.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.~arabnikita rated 8/10 on 18 August 2023"

When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero."," One Step Above Masterpiece!: It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy.

This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," One of the best sequels to anything ever made: If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.~pugpool10 rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," A new Empire Strikes Back: This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.~rickothan rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," Okay This Is Peak: First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.~hectorvernet rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.~cricketbat rated 7/10 on 1 June 2023"," It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5): Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.~nickryan-44535 rated 7/10 on 6 June 2023"," My movie of 2023 so far.: It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 11 June 2023"," This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.: I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.~DeadMansTrousers rated 6/10 on 14 June 2023"," Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it: I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 11 June 2023"
The Hunger Games (2012) - IMDb,7.2,Jennifer Lawrence|Josh Hutcherson|Liam Hemsworth|Stanley Tucci|Wes Bentley|Willow Shields|Elizabeth Banks|Sandra Ellis Lafferty|Paula Malcomson|Rhoda Griffis|Sandino Moya-Smith|Raiko Bowman|Dwayne Boyd|Anthony Reynolds|Judd Lormand|Woody Harrelson|Toby Jones|Kimiko Gelman,Gary Ross,Gary Ross|Suzanne Collins|Billy Ray,Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games: a televised competition in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to fight to the death.," Perspective from a VERY senior citizen: This is not so much a review, everything has already been said in the other postings, but rather my experience with this movie and book.OK, look, I'm probably old enough to be the grandfather of most of the people submitting reviews to this movie. I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.~The_DATo rated 10/10 on 24 May 2022"," Silent Thrills: The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.~billygoat1071 rated 8/10 on 25 March 2012"," I'm shocked! I loved it!: First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.8/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 8/10 on 22 April 2012"," Well, it's no Battle Royale...: There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.~wandereramor rated 6/10 on 23 May 2012"," Not quite the Battle Royale: Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.~hani_78696 rated 7/10 on 8 October 2012"," How can this be a cult movie?: OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...~aryassen rated 3/10 on 23 March 2012"," Modern Classic: ""The Hunger Games"" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like ""Bullett"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""Westworld"" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe ""The Hunger Games"" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig's mouth), ""The Running Man"" (More on this later), ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), ""The Lottery"" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in ""The Hunger Games"", since with the exception of the overall winner, ""Winning"" the lottery is a negative,""Total Drama Island"" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, ""Survivor"", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens ""I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks ""History of The World Part I"")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: "" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The ""Karate Kid"" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of ""The Hunger Games"" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when ""Judges"" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: ""My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you."" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):"" There are lots of underdogs in this world,"" he snaps, ""if you could really see them, you would not root for them either."" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""The Running Man."" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the ""Love Sign"", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars.~davidjanuzbrown rated 10/10 on 20 August 2012"," Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!: Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In ""The Hunger Games"", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of ""The Hunger Games"" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next ""Twilight"" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least ""Battle Royale"" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in ""The Hunger Games"" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see ""The Hunger Games"". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, ""The Hunger Games"" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10~GirishGowda rated 3/10 on 26 March 2012"," Spoilers! But don't worry, it's already predictable and weak.: The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. ""Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!"" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll.~groovieknave-177-74234 rated 1/10 on 27 March 2012"," Battle Royale with cheese: In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.~jackharding89-1 rated 3/10 on 9 April 2012"
The Killer (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Michael Fassbender|Tilda Swinton|Charles Parnell|Arliss Howard|Kerry O'Malley|Sophie Charlotte|Emiliano Pernía|Gabriel Polanco|Sala Baker|Endre Hules|Bernard Bygott|Monique Ganderton|Daran Norris|Nikki Dixon|Paloma Palacio Colon|Lía Lockhart|Arturo Duvergé|Génesis Estévez,David Fincher,Alexis Nolent|Luc Jacamon|Andrew Kevin Walker,"After a fateful near-miss, an assassin battles his employers and himself, on an international manhunt he insists isn't personal."," Definitely an interesting and suspenseful movie, but lacking in the brilliance I had hoped for...: Defnitely not a bad movie for sure, but one which has an odd feature that might annoy or put off some folks...The bad: beware this movie is one contineous MONOLOGUE by Michael Fassbender, contineously speaking to himself in his head (silently) about HOW he is planning AND executing his killing sprees. We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting. Not terrible, but not elevating me either....Something else DID disappoint me more though...More bad: I was waiting for SOME surprising and original twist or plot turn, that would make this story stand out from any other crime movie, which unfortunately never came. Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best. Still worth a watch though, but I only would dare recommmend this to the arthouse movie fans of this killer crime genre.~imseeg rated 7/10 on 31 October 2023"," Great looking, but dull as dishwater.: What happens when a hired killer makes a mistake?After a twenty minute introduction, something finally happens, and you're left with a film that's beautifully shot, well acted, with a somewhat interesting story.The trouble is, if this film were a song, it would be something by The Smiths, there's definitely a fan base, but for some of us, it's all just too slow, too dull, and ultimately a depressing affair.The voiceovers become a little irritating after an hour or so, and that constant first person narration slows the film down to a snail's pace.Neo noir style, nice to look at, and I did like Michael Fassbinder's performance, but ultimately I couldn't stop myself from yawning for the full two hours.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 12 November 2023"," Plot-Lovers Will Need To Look Elsewhere: I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. I consider Zodiac, The Social Network, & Fight Club to be amongst my favorite films, and Mindhunter in that same category for TV shows. So, even with The Killer dropping on Netflix, I went to a special theater showing to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way in to this one--mainly because plot-lovers (like me) will largely be a bit lost.For a very basic overview, ""The Killer"" tells the story of the unnamed Killer (Michael Fassbender) hired to perform a rather tedious assassination. When the plan goes a bit awry, however, he must compromise--or at least re-evaluate--some of his principles as he ventures into uncharted emotional territory.The Killer is certainly a clinic in cinematography and choreography, as is the usual Fincher style. Its action set pieces are tension-filled and Fassbender's flat aesthetic is perfect for the lead role. Half the film's dialogue is the Killer's snarky inner monologue, and again Fassbender nails that.The big problem--at least for plot-lovers--here is that there is seemingly very little context or rhyme/reason for what we see transpire. Almost nothing is provided other than what is literally playing out in front of viewers in any given scene. As such, I really struggled to care about anything that was happening--in large part because it quite frankly felt like a series of disconnected interludes as opposed to a whole, coherent story. There were times I even felt bored watching because I knew an extended espionage scene was upcoming and I didn't fully understand the stakes.Seeing as how The Killer is getting relatively high marks, I can assume either one of two things is happening: 1. Audiences are not as hung-up on the lack of discernible plot/motives than I; or 2. There is a deeper message here that I'm just utterly missing. Perhaps the ongoing monologue holds the key--but again, I found that more snarky/sardonic than informative.Perhaps more analysis or a second viewing will crystalize The Killer for me--but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of my first viewing I have to place it near (perhaps at) the bottom of the Fincher canon.~zkonedog rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," Average: Was really looking forward to this movie as i like Michael Fassbender and David Fincher and they never showed it at any cinemas near me during its limited release. Maybe i've just built it up too much in my head but i can't help but be disappointed in it.It has alot of cool style and it as dark as you'd expect from Fincher. Who as you'd imagine, does a good job of directing. But its a very straightforward story and i couldn't help but say ""Would a professional hitman really do that?"" at certain points of it.The constant commentary of the movie won't be for everyone and there's only so much dramatic acting Fassbender can do as a stealthy killer. So all in all. Pretty average.~martinrobertson300482 rated 5/10 on 10 November 2023"," ""If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you."": That's a quote from the opening scene of the movie. I'll give them credit for telling you upfront: you are in for an absolute slog of a movie. It's not hyperbole for me to tell you this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was extremely difficult to get through. I thought about quitting multiple times.To make it worse, the story is ultra basic and fully bland. There is zero intrigue. It failed at making me care about anything or anyone in the movie. There is one really cool fight scene that lasts a couple minutes. Other than that, nothing about this movie stands out.The quality level of filmmaking is far from terrible. But it's swept aside by the sheer boredom that is this movie. I really wish Netflix could figure out how to make movies. I feel like it has to be the writing. Or maybe they just take on scripts that aren't worth making. Way to waste Fassbender.~FeastMode rated 2/10 on 11 November 2023"," Boring movie that's more style over substance: I'm surprised by all the positive reviews here. If you like movies that are stylistic and pretty in theory, but boring and consulates in practice, I guess you'll like this movie. But if you're someone who actually cares about plot, I'd definitely pass.For starters, this movie takes forever to get to the point. It starts off with narration that just continues and continues. If you make it past the dull start, you'll discover an unoriginal plot that's just not interesting enough to justify its unnecessary complexity. There are a few stand out moments, but they're strung together poorly. There's also nothing to get you invested in the characters or their well-being. You're just watching a guy do stuff, and sometimes it's interesting, but a lot of the times it's not.~aprilsfriendorin rated 3/10 on 31 October 2023"," Incredibly slow, predictable and nothing out of the ordinary.: 3.5 ⭐I love Finchers work but this one was a bit off. This film had a typical revenge story with a lackluster ending. Fassbender lead the way only to discover the script limited his potential for a great performance. The whole film was just sitting and waiting for the peak to hit but it never does.Cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. Production was decent but it didnt seem difficult at all given how the film played out. Dont think any awards will be dished out for this one..A watch and forget movie with no lasting impressions from the audience. Probably why Fincher chose Netflix. Its free to watch for a script he pulled from the middle rack.I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone trying to save 2 hours of their night.~jon_hsieh rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," It's...fine?: It's well compiled. The narration got me invested. Shot beautifully, the suspenseful music is excellent. The movie as a whole is...yeah it's fine? It lacks depth and some scenes lack logic as well. It makes for a fun watch nevertheless. Better than most of the stuff going around these days. A one time watch and you never think about it again kind of a watch. Not Fincher's best but not his worst either. Fassbender is decent in his role portrayed as a mysterious killer who has a knack for everything pretty much. Solid punches to the face by a guy twice his size does not faze him at all. That's about it really.~SneakyWasabi rated 6/10 on 10 November 2023"," Yeah, nah.: The Killer simply gives you no reason to be invested in it, rather empty, uneventful and dull for the runtime.It's nothing you haven't seen before either and without substance, considering those involved, though not awful or anything. The soundtrack however is awful, given it isn't satire like ""American Psycho."" The fight scene's like a video game, skill and cunning's hardly overcoming that sort of velocity of power. Take the UFC battle between Frank Mir and Brock Lesnar as a basic example. I mean the sequence's probably still the highlight of the film, I just didn't buy it. All up a pretty pointless film.~bombersflyup rated 3/10 on 11 November 2023"," Empathy is Weakness: The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is a paid assassin. In Paris he misses his mark (Endre Hules) and kills a dominatrix (Monique Ganderton) instead. He now becomes a mark himself. He arrives late at home to discover his girlfriend in a hospital. He goes on a revenge tour.The film consists of Fassbender talking in a monotone in his head. It is boring as he keeps giving himself the same rules and affirmations over and over. There is an element of humor in his various alias based on fictional characters in 1970's TV shows. I caught, Felix Unger, Oscar Madison, Howard Cunningham, Reuben Kincaid, Sam Malone, George Jefferson, Lou Grant, and Robert Hartley (Bob Newhart Show). That was the fun aspect and WWJWBD.Too boring for my tastes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.~nogodnomasters rated 3/10 on 8 November 2023"
