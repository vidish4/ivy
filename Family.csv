Wonka (2023) - IMDb,7.3,Timothée Chalamet|Gustave Die|Murray McArthur|Paul G. Raymond|Bertie Caplan|Isy Suttie|Kobna Holdbrook-Smith|Matilda Tucker|Tom Davis|Olivia Colman|Calah Lane|Paterson Joseph|Matt Lucas|Mathew Baynton|Freya Parker|Keegan-Michael Key|Jim Carter|Rakhee Thakrar,Paul King,Simon Farnaby|Paul King|Roald Dahl,"With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers."," The Wonderful World of Wonka...: The voyages out at sea are being halted, as there are caramels you need to make quite salted, beans of cocoa to enhance, along with magic and a dance, but there are those who will curtail, and have you halted. Fickelgruber, Prodnos, Slugworth guard their brands, and there is no way they will let you get your hands, on their produce and confection, there will be no insurrection, an Oompa-Lumpa's guaranteed, to make some fans. But with the help of hard done Noodle and some friends, who Mrs Scrubbit's small print penalties have penned, you can treat hundreds and thousands, melt away all the cartel's scams, in a cinematic smooth, refined, sweet blend.Great performances, beautiful story, sweet and delightful throughout.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 30 December 2023"," The best version of a cynical idea: On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 9 December 2023"," 2023's most enjoyable holiday hit: Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timothée Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)~eddie_baggins rated 8/10 on 14 December 2023"," This had no business being this good!: I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one.~thabaddest-74261 rated 10/10 on 24 December 2023"," It looks the part, the actors are terrific, but the actual story and the songs fail to really excite me.: Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 9 December 2023"," A perfect festive treat.: Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," Come with me to a world of your imagination: WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10.~Padreviews rated 10/10 on 14 December 2023"," An Imaginative Fantastic Journey: I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film.~DeltaHomicide rated 9/10 on 6 December 2023"," Missing that Oomph: Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did.~Larsii90 rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Loved It!: As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you.~bb52366 rated 10/10 on 9 December 2023"
Home Alone (1990) - IMDb,7.7,Macaulay Culkin|Joe Pesci|Daniel Stern|John Heard|Roberts Blossom|Catherine O'Hara|Angela Goethals|Devin Ratray|Gerry Bamman|Hillary Wolf|John Candy|Larry Hankin|Michael C. Maronna|Kristin Minter|Diana Rein|Jedidiah Cohen|Kieran Culkin|Senta Moses,Chris Columbus,John Hughes,"An eight-year-old troublemaker, mistakenly left home alone, must defend his home against a pair of burglars on Christmas Eve."," A timeless classic: Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 23 November 2003"," Masterful comedy/family flick: Seen this classic so many times and never ceases to get old. With a bunch of great scenery, adorableness, original vibes, and comedy! Macaulay Culkin shined so much, he deserved the millions earned for his role. I love how Joe Pesci went from Scorsese films where he swore so much where as in this he had to bite his tongue. John Hughe was a gifted writer that helmed some gems!~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 28 September 2020"," Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the Grinches Who Almost Steal Christmas...: The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic. The proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!~Doylenf rated NA on 18 May 2001"," Heartwarming Holiday family classic.: 'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 18 February 2003"," The perfect Christmas film: Home Alone is one of the best slapstick comedies I have ever seen.The comedy is top-notch, the slapstick is fantastic.It's not just that, the direction, editing, and pacing are immaculate.And obviously Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern are phenomenal here, I can't imagine them being played by anyone else, they are just perfect.Some of these edits wouldn't be in films like this today.But this movie is also delightful, dare I say even a little heartwarming, it's the perfect Christmas movie to watch every year.I'm gonna give Home Alone an A+.~mrashtastic89 rated 10/10 on 11 December 2021"," The Best Christmas Film of the Past 20 Years: ""Home Alone"" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 4 November 2000"," Culkin Really Shines Here: But don't forget about the presence of Stern and Pesci as bumbling comedic antagonists as Culkin is Kevin. As he is sent to his room after his jerk of a brother blames him for a mistake.And that Kevin is left behind after the family were trying to make it to France there. But at first he loves having the house to himself, eats pizza, and does things that he would not have to do.But when he misses his family there. After an old man played by the late Roberts Blossom there is meant to be scary but in reality he is a kind old man just misunderstood there.He has to protect the house while trying to get his family back home. Really a good start in MacCulay Culkin's career.~shelbythuylinh rated 9/10 on 2 December 2021"," One of the best Christmas movies (a close second to Die Hard).: Angels with Filthy Souls...when I first saw Home Alone I thought this black and white gangster movie that inspires Kevin was a real movie!! But I recently found out it wasn't, and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible. Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article ""Inside the Making of ​ Home Alone​'s Fake Gangster Movie"" by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.~safenoe rated 10/10 on 18 December 2016"," Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal!: In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 7/10 on 14 December 2006"," Wonderful!: I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 5 May 2009"
It's a Wonderful Life (1946) - IMDb,8.6,James Stewart|Donna Reed|Lionel Barrymore|Thomas Mitchell|Henry Travers|Beulah Bondi|Frank Faylen|Ward Bond|Gloria Grahame|H.B. Warner|Frank Albertson|Todd Karns|Samuel S. Hinds|Mary Treen|Virginia Patton|Charles Williams|Sarah Edwards|William Edmunds,Frank Capra,Frances Goodrich|Albert Hackett|Frank Capra,An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.," ""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town"": I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 25 December 2005"," A Great Influence...: No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...~Coxer99 rated 10/10 on 4 March 1999"," One of those quintessential Christmas movies....: It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 28 March 2010"," A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic: This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.~FlickJunkie-2 rated 10/10 on 6 December 2000"," A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.: This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.~PyrolyticCarbon rated 10/10 on 13 September 2002"," Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.: Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.~Aidan McGuinness rated 9/10 on 11 February 2002"," It's a Wonderful Life: One of the best family movies I have ever seen, the storyline is amazing and puts hope in your heart. When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know. The events of the film were fun. The characters of the film were good. Two characters were prepared, James and Clarence. They were very interesting characters and I really enjoyed watching them. The end of the film is one of the best movie endings in history. I recommend watching it especially the black and white version. The black version is better than the color version. It's a Wonderful Movie~auuwws rated 10/10 on 11 January 2021"," Atop my Top Ten: I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.~dweck rated NA on 9 December 1998"," Who are you, really?: Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience. Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.~JFHunt rated 10/10 on 27 January 2007"," IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE: I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.~brianlion rated 10/10 on 5 November 2002"
A Christmas Story (1983) - IMDb,7.9,Peter Billingsley|Melinda Dillon|Darren McGavin|Scott Schwartz|Jean Shepherd|Ian Petrella|Tedde Moore|R.D. Robb|Zack Ward|Yano Anaya|Jeff Gillen|Colin Fox|Paul Hubbard|Leslie Carlson|Jim Hunter|Patty Johnson|Drew Hocevar|David Svoboda,Bob Clark,Jean Shepherd|Leigh Brown|Bob Clark,"In the 1940s, a young boy named Ralphie Parker attempts to convince his parents, teacher, and Santa Claus that a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun really is the perfect Christmas gift."," Just wonderful: Nostalgic tale of a Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) growing up in the 1940s (I believe). He wants nothing more than a Red Ryder Ranger Model Air Rifle (a BB gun for short) for Christmas but everyone tells him it will ""shoot your eye out"".That's about it for plot but the film has sequences that every child (and adult) can relate to. My favorites: Ralphie's best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he's dared to lick it; Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father; the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up (in a GREAT scene); Ralphie's constant fights with his little brother (wonderfully played by Ian Petrella) and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents-- especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It's now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever made--right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (which was also ignored at its release).A charming, wonderful Christmas film. A 10 all the way!~preppy-3 rated 10/10 on 23 December 2004"," A timeless movie that will never get old: A Christmas Story, there is absolutely no way that anyone could ever say they never saw this film since it's shown every Christmas, especially on TNT when they do the 24 hours of A Christmas Story, lol. But onto the movie, I've watched A Christmas Story since the day I was born, it's one of those films you never get sick of because of the simple fact that each year of your life you could relate to it in some way. Each character has these memorable moments and you could say that you've been in the same situation. It's great seeing this movie because it makes us laugh about the silliest moments in our life during the Christmas season.Ralphie is a little boy who just so badly wants a B.B. gun for Christmas, it's just his dream. Only one problem, it'll shoot his eye out according to the adults around him. We go through Christmas with Ralphie and his family, his father who is obsessed with a prize leg lamp he won. His mother who is greatly under-appreciated but extremely loving. His brother, Randy, who is your typical silly and annoying younger brother who makes fun of him. And his friends who are on a constant run from the school bully. But all Ralphie can think about during this hard time in his adolescence is that B.B. gun.A Christmas Story has constant unforgettable scenes, like the pink bunny out fit that Ralphie gets as a present from his aunt, him saying his first swear in front of his dad, Mom and Dad's fight over using the glue on purpose, visiting Santa at the mall, and of course that great ending that is sure to bring a that is sure to bring a tear to your eye. It's just the perfect Christmas movie that is a BIG recommendation for the season. It has great comedy, terrific acting, and just the most touching moments you'll ever see in a Christmas movie.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 16 November 2003"," Christmas Classic: A Christmas Story touches my heart as does no other film, and I know the reason for this is because it reminds me so much of my own 1950's boyhood. For sure it strikes a nerve in persons of my generation. This is Bob Clark's masterpiece and I know I am not the only person who feels this way. I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, chances are you have seen the film; indeed, probably have seen it countless times as I have. This is not a film review in the normal sense. It is more a reminiscence and appreciation of a great story captured for all time in moving pictures which, in turn, captured the essence of the time and place of its setting; that time and setting being a typical town in Indiana during Christmas season in the 1940s as we observe a typical family (the Parkers) with two young sons named Ralphie and Randy. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate very well to the story's key elements. I recall vividly family outings to crowded downtown sidewalks, Mom and Dad squeezing in a season's worth of shopping in one day and doing it under the nose of one who had a visit to Santa Claus on his mind. Staring at the prominent HIGBEES sign in the downtown square, I could almost see the words John A. Brown in its place. Browns was the main department store in my hometown of Oklahoma City and the place where I would make my annual visit with Santa Claus.I am sure most who have seen the film realize this is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon as the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work. The stove in the Parker's kitchen reminds much of the one my grandmother had, and the rest of the house reminded me of the home my other grandparents lived in. As you see, viewing A Christmas Story is always a magical experience for me. It is almost as if Mr. Clark made this film with Tom Fowler in mind. There are so many comments to make. It will be impossible to relate them all in a short review, but here are some that I know people my age will be most familiar with:Beautiful toys displayed in department store windows. The agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. I could go on and on. I will make two more observations and then will sign off and let somebody else speak.In the film's sweetest scene, we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's (ably played by Peter Billingsley) face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments. But, for me the best moment was the last. Ralphie is in bed at film's end. We see snow outside and Ralphie dreaming of his wonderful gift, as the story's author and narrator Jean Shepherd, speaking as the grown up Ralphie, realizes this was the best Christmas he ever had, or ever would have.If you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story, you are perhaps unaware that you have cheated yourself. Buy or rent the 2003 20th anniversary DVD. It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas.~Tommy-5 rated 10/10 on 8 December 2005"," Classic Christmas film that doesn't age: Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas but his mother is totally against it - the ""you'll shoot your eye out"" discussion being a major opposition.This is essentially a story about childhood and is very spot-on in regards to the yearning of children and the whole Christmas era - I've been watching it since I was a child and every Christmas when it comes on TV I watch it again. It's funny, poignant and totally memorable - it has some of the best scenes of all-time and although I know a few people who dislike it because it's a bit ""weird"" and ""dark,"" most people I know love it.Worth watching every Christmas, forever!~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 13 December 2004"," A timeless Christmas film: ""A Christmas Story"" is a rare film about children yet for adults.  While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmas-themed saga, adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated, polysyllabic narration of Ralphie, filled with nostalgia and lucid memories, and the soft, high-pitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word.  The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film, but a character wholly outside the story, reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes.  Yet he is the heart of the film, the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Clause and a BB gun - it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke.  To that end, ""A Christmas Story"" is flawless.""A Christmas Story"" tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he searches for the golden, upheld idol of all red-blooded American boys:  A Red Rider Air Rifle.  Ralphie spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it - including an essay, a trip to Santa Claus and more.  The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family - his irritable, foul-mouthed father with a good heart, his whiny brother Randy, and his sweet, all-American mother.  It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes, but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film.  The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story.  He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment, Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing - only to have Billingsley note in his awe-filled, high-pitched voice that ""I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun.  It's very good for Christmas."" (paraphrased).  Most of the humor is similar - the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also, there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season - it's a movie everyone can relate to.  There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power.  I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child - in this case, the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously, ""A Christmas Story"" is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane.  It simply excels at its simple goals, and comes together as an extraordinarily entertaining piece of cinema.~JPTaylor rated 9/10 on 22 December 2003"," Christmas is Not Complete Without Watching This: The 1983 ""Terms of Endearment"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Now it was deserved. The film still remains popular today. What's hard to believe now is that ""A Christmas Story"" (released the same year) was ignored everywhere. If anything it should of been nominated for best adapted screenplay!Now when the film was released it was ""Critically Acclaimed"" but, MGM failed to capitalized on that. The film was poorly handled & failed to capture a large theatrical audience!Well thanks to the Home Video Market & television this film has now become part of Americana. It also helped that Ted Turner made ""24 Hours Of A Christmas Story"" an annual event.It is now 2017, and ""A Christmas Story"" it is now one of the most popular films of all time. Even ""Return of the Jedi"" ( The Highest Grossing Film of 1983) ""Isn't gaining as many new fans"". .""Return of the Jedi"" has always rode the coattails of the earlier ""Star Wars"" films. ""A Christmas Story"" has gained fans for just being a great film!Now my reviewSet in the 1940's the film makes you identify with Ralphie and you your routing for him in every single way!Ralphie is in elementary school. His has a little brother and all he wants for Christmas is a BB-Gun. He wants this more than anything. Before Christmas gets there he has many obstacles to overcome. One of them is getting home! He & his friends are always being bullied before they can make it home. The film is flawless. It is a joy to watch and only improves every time you watch it. It is also true that for some reason the older it gets the better it becomes! You need to see this. Also there is a fan made documentary called ""A Christmas Story Documentary: Road Trip for Ralphie"". That is a great fan made documentary.~Sober-Friend rated 9/10 on 29 December 2017"," Pure joy!: How difficult is it to perfectly capture nostalgia? It must be pretty darn difficult or else everyone would make movies like this. It may not be absolute perfection but Jean Shepherd, Bob Clark and the outstanding cast came as close as anyone here.Creating a story centered around nostalgia is a tricky thing as the memories that creates it are unique to each of us. The themes, however, are similar and that's where the success lies.I didn't want a Red Ryder BB gun when I was that age but my Christmas wish was just as fervent and I schemed just as hard as Ralphie. The bully at my school didn't have yellow eyes but he was pretty much like Scut Farkus. And so on, from the fantastically flawed parents to the pop-heroes, A Christmas Story captures it all.Truly wonderful.~CMUltra rated 9/10 on 25 December 2005"," This one bears up to repeated: Unlike many people, I don't particularly like seeing movies more than once. Of course there are some exceptions, but I am not a person who usually sees a movie again and again--I find this very boring. However, there are several exceptions--and this movie probably heads the list. Unlike other films this one actually becomes better with repeated viewings--and it's great to see and hear the wonderful and silly lines again--especially when they are are friends and family there to see it and laugh along with you. Perfect writing (albeit, very, very cynical), wonderful acting, great attention to details (the 1940s look to the film is great--down to the boxes of soap and radio programs) and so many funny and sentimental moments make this a perennial favorite. If you haven't seen this then get out from under your rock and see it! If you don't like it, then think about getting psychiatric help!

Even though I'm a girl and was born in the late seventies, my Christmases were much the same as Ralphie's. From playing Santa on Christmas morning to sipping my Dad's Christmas cocktail to visiting Santa at the department store, I lived the very same Christmas memories.  This movie brings out the true essence of Christmas happiness.  Everyone, young and old, can relive the magic of being a child.Ralphie's vibrant imagination and inventiveness in his ploys to seduce his parents into buying him the ultimate gift are ""pinch-his-chubby-cheeks"" adorable.  And Randy...need I say anything??  He is the perfect picture of the baby brother!This movie is universal in its appeal to audiences of all ages, race, and nationalities.  My husband, who grew up in Lebanon and who's first language is Arabic, even knew the famous ""oh fudge"" line when I first played this movie for him here in the States.I get giddy every time I sit down to watch this movie.

Sorry but I thought the film was surprisingly good!: Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 9 September 2009"," This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made: How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the city of Whoville which is filled with Whos. One day a grinch is accidentally delivered there and tries to understand their ways and love for Christmas but fails and comes to loath it. He moves into the far mountains of Whoville and becomes a hermit. When a little girl knocks on his door and tries to get him in the Christmas spirit he decides to take his hate for Christmas out on the locals. Can anyone or anything stop him?This movie is directed by icon Ron Howard (Splash) and stars Jim Carrey (Liar Liar), Clint Howard (The Waterboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Christine Baranski (Chicago), Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Taylor Momsen (Gossip Girls).Everything about this movie is perfect. The universe is perfectly created and thoroughly captures your imagination. The backdrops, sets and props are stupendous. The costumes, makeup and hairstyles were a lot of fun. Jim Carrey delivers an amazing performance. His dialogue, mannerisms and facial expressions are awesome. The storyline is well written and I loved the way it explains how the Grinch arrived, his childhood, his current state and his evolution. How can you not love Max and the ending was perfect. Even the soundtrack is good.Overall, this is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 10/10 on 24 December 2022"," Every Year I Like It a Little More: The Grinch hates Christmas, then steals it!When this first came out I liked the original version much more, but as time goes on I'm finding myself preferring this version more and more. Perhaps it's because Jim Carey's portrayal is more relatable, or perhaps I'm more impressed with the visuals and production value than I once was, or maybe I just understand the adult jokes more. Whatever the reason, this is a fantastic adaptation.What stands out above all is Jim Carey's performance, followed by the sets and costumes. It is an unforgettable experience that might never be replicated again.While kids may prefer the original, certainly this will be all the adults most preferred version of the Grinch.~jordyntsmith rated 8/10 on 4 December 2023"," No Kidding, It was Great! Wassup with you guys????: Well, I finally broke down and went to see it.  I was hesitant after reading all the pans here.  Egad!   It was a great movie! You can't compare it to the ""original"" any more  than you can compare ""Scrooge"" to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes (obviously impromptu) were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as over-blown as I had expected.  As for the  ""prequel"" portion, well, it was only so-so. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the ""Ah hoo torres"" song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.   As for the negative comments on imdb.com I gotta say...""get over it, ya big bunch of grinches!!!!!""~Donsgal rated NA on 27 November 2000"," Christmas Giggles: I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.This film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.I laughed my nuts off at this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at Christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheerSo to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The Godfather"" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!~toffeesi rated 7/10 on 16 December 2004"," Visually good but really carried by Jim Carrey: In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time.  However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child.  A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.~bob the moo rated NA on 26 December 2003"," A Christmas favorite: One of my all time favorite Christmas movies.The grinch is hilarious, the older you get the more relatable it gets. I think Jim Carrey puts a great spin on the lovably quirky grinch. 7 o'clock, dinner with myself, I can't cancel that again!~Calicodreamin rated 8/10 on 4 December 2019"," Jim Carrey at his best in the Grinch!: Ask and Who, there's no place like Whoville around Christmas Day. Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie ""Yes Man"" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show ""Gossip Girl"" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now. This movie also stars Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans, and Mindy Sterling. This is a good Christmas movie for the whole family to watch.~brownah18 rated 8/10 on 17 December 2009"," THE GRINCH: Ok as soon as I heard that this FILM was being done Live. And Jim Carrey was in it and Who was Directed bye.I KNEW that this FILM would be a""MASTERPIECE""""NO ONE IS SMART ENOUGH TO BE THE GRINCH BUT JIM CARREY""~hotwheelerd rated 10/10 on 25 April 2019"," Merry Christmas to All...: I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months.  Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.~jennifer-99 rated 10/10 on 27 November 2000"

This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it~A_Different_Drummer rated 9/10 on 8 January 2016"," Sweet and charming, salvaged by the cast: Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 7/10 on 31 December 2010"," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz: Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.~bob the moo rated NA on 16 November 2003"," A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...: Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****~moonspinner55 rated 7/10 on 23 December 2007"," An instant holiday classic: Ferrell's crowning achievement to date!: ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, Faizon Love, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, Peter Billingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!~george.schmidt rated NA on 10 November 2003"," Classic Christmas spirit.: This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.~patriciogl10 rated 8/10 on 3 October 2019"," Elf Will Be A New Christmas Classic!: After seeing ""Elf"" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer.

Without a doubt.7 out of 10 Stars.~korch-3 rated 7/10 on 31 October 2003"," Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer: At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10~pyrocitor rated 8/10 on 14 December 2015"," There's magic in the man in green.: The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him. At times, this can even bring on a tear of joy.~mark.waltz rated 10/10 on 21 December 2020"," WOW I forgot how great this film was: BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS.

The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 5 February 2009"," Yes, same plot, but it still gets the same laughs as the first one did if not more: Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun. It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York. Instead of complaining or panicking, he just plain enjoys it. He goes on the ultimate tour with his father's bag of money and credit cards and cons himself into the Plaza Hotel claiming he's there with his dad. But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital. But Kevin is going to make sure that they don't mess around with the kids and has set his uncle's abandoned apartment up for a fun house of traps.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was an absolute blast. The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?!""... the lady just smiles and says ""The finest in New York!"", it was just too funny!

In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.With a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 9/10 on 7 May 2004"," Merry Christmas You Filthy Animals: I actually enjoy this one more than the first. Love seeing some of the iconic sites of New York City, and just what it looked like in 1992.A very similar formula to the first but obviously set in NYC, so there was a lot of potential for different ideas which I felt they capitalized on. Steady laughs throughout from all the characters. The addition of Tim Curry was amazing. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern crack me up in their roles as the Wet/Sticky Bandits.A very good sequel that delivers in pretty much every way, especially the Christmas feels.~Slarkshark rated 8/10 on 25 December 2020"," I love it!: ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.8/10~dee.reid rated 8/10 on 7 December 2005", Christmas classic: The first 2 home alone films are classics and i watch them ever year like a couple of times each a year since i was a kid and my honest opinion is that the second one is my favourite out of the 2 probably because is based in new york and as i'm not American seeing new york at Christmas is like a dream.~brandonrhewitt rated 10/10 on 13 October 2020," Same plot. Same actors. New traps. No problem.: Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same plot as the first movie, but Home Alone 2 is a very good sequel. The new traps for the Wet, er... Sticky Bandits are great.

There is a lot of enjoyment in this movie.~Op_Prime rated NA on 16 April 2000", Great sequel: This is one of the few times the sequel is better than the original. A classic Christmas movie.

He follows the wrong person and ends up on a flight to New York. There The Wet Bandits Harry played by Daniel Stern and Marv played By Joe Pesci are on the loose and after Kevin.This is a better film than the first. John Hughs is a wonderful writer and has gone on to making and writing classic films such as Pretty In Pink with Jon Cryer. This is a very funny film with great casting and wonderful storyline.

He makes a pact with an elf to help him win--and the elf casts a spell that brings the 12 days of Christmas to life, which brings unexpected chaos to town."," Dash of Cheer, a Pinch of Symbolism, and a Sprinkle of Cringe: Candy Cane Lane delivers a festive punch with its spirited competition for the title of the best-decorated house, adding a touch of homey charm to the holiday tale. The unexpected twist involving a mischievous elf banishment brings a hint of symbolism, though I might be delving too deep into it. Nevertheless, the Christmas magic is palpable, complete with 'Parents Just Don't Understand' vibes, vibrant colors, and whimsical decor.While the humor occasionally falls short in delivery, with jokes teetering on the edge of laughter, the movie brings forth chuckles and witty lines like ""You elf'in kidding me."" Admittedly, it felt like a subtle ad campaign for Jeep, El Segundo's Candy Cane Lane, and USC-Fight on, I suppose. Despite the cheesy and slightly cringy Christmas love, it's a worthwhile watch during the holiday season. I'd give it a festive 2.5/5 stars - because, after all, 'tis the season for a bit of Christmas movie magic!~Entertainmentsparadise rated 5/10 on 3 December 2023"," Eddie Murphy Christmas Movie: Candy Cane Lane is on the less offensive side of Christmas movie releases but suffers from being far too long at an energy draining two hours. Just when it starts wrapping up another 30 minutes come from nowhere.Eddie Murphy carries the movie and helps to push it over the line. It is a step up from his previous Amazon Original, Coming 2 America. Jillian Bell is annoying as always but fits in better in this zany christmas movie.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but Candy Cane Lane passes the time and is at least better than the 50 Hallmark exclusive movies which are soon coming down the pike.~johnnyhbtvs27 rated 5/10 on 1 December 2023"," What a mess...: Wow... So Eddie Murphy delivers his second Amazon Movie and his first Christmas themed movie and as a huge Fan of his I can say I'm absolutely disappointed.The movie starts of promising and seems to build up to original ideas, but only goes downhill as soon as the story starts to evolve. Sadly it's a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it's hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes. There's not one scene that really made me laugh and the movie is so exhausting at times that i really struggled not to turn it off. I don't know what Eddie was thinking but this feels soulless and you can see it on the actors faces and their energy. Everyone seems bored, the dialogue's are hideous and nothing clicks... this is really disappointing and falls in the category of the Eddie Murphy movies that will be forgotten sooner than later.~Shazam1303 rated 3/10 on 1 December 2023"," Bit of a guilty pleasure yet so worth it!: I'm surprised to see the 5.3 rating especially on the day 1 release, this movie is magnificent! I love most anything with Eddie Murphy some isn't as good but most projects are great. Candy Cane Lane is a unique wonderful holiday film a nice way to prepare for the spirit of everything even if its cheesy I love it quite a bit although I should say I have autism I enjoy different things than most. Very much reminds me of a Matthew Broderick and Danny Devito film called Deck the Halls that's a fun one that's very similar one without as much special effects. I admire Eddie he's done a lot of offbeat ones and iconic projects, I'm sure he's great to be around.~UniqueParticle rated 8/10 on 2 December 2023"," Delightful!: Why the low ratings? This is such a fun family holiday movie. Don't sleep on the adorable end credit scene. This was such an original movie-not like the cookie cutter predictable ones we are all used to. Eddie Murphy is a delight and tracee Ellis Ross is wonderful. I thought it was entertaining and enjoyable. If you want a comedic, colorful Christmas movie, you'll enjoy this. I also enjoyed the representation and inclusion aspect of the movie as well. All around, really lovely family movie. Definitely worth the watch. Much better than family switch on Netflix-woof! Happy holidays, everyone! And a happy new year.~Gilmoregirl-59340 rated 8/10 on 10 December 2023"," A Fun PG Eddie Murphy Film!: We might like to see Eddie Murphy do adult comedy, but this was surprisingly funny and very entertaining. The humor is a mix of adult and young adult and it's actually pretty nice to see Eddie Murphy do something than R rated comedy. Tracee Ellis Ross also compliments his character very well, she hits with the humor right on time and is used very well and not just a (background) wife. The figurines are hilarious as well! Whenever they hit the screen, I at least smiled and chuckled, the CGI was perfect too! Loved every bit of the premise as well. Could Jillian Bell do better as a villian? Yes. Could they have gotten a better actress for that? Maybe. She doesn't take away from the movie but ties it up in the end for what it was. Enjoy this holiday special, i did and you will!~rocketwoods rated 7/10 on 2 December 2023"," Fun Family Christmas Film from Eddie Murphy: ""Candy Cane Lane"" is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross. The movie is directed by Reginald Hudlin (""Boomerang"", ""House Party"", ""The Black Godfather""). Murphy and Ross play a married couple, the Carvers, whose house in the Los Angeles suburbs is a perennial candidate for their block's Christmas decorations contest. Chris (Murphy) in particular is a Christmas obsessionist, so much so that his children (and, coincidentally, his wife) all have Christmas-themed names and the family's garage is overflowing with Christmas memorabilia throughout the year. As the story begins, Chris is a sales manager freshly laid off just in time for the holiday (an exchange with a supervisor references Chris' alleged oldness by the fact that he uses a rolodex). Wife Carol is looking at a promotion at a distribution services factory. In the midst of the very mixed career news for mom and dad, Chris buys a gaudy, flamboyant lawn-decoration Christmas tree a from a pop-up store run by a chatty manager (an alternately perky and menacing Jillian Bell). Unbeknownst to Chris, Pepper the manager is actually a rogue elf (fired by Santa for being a martinet about the naughty list) who likes to sell enchanted Christmas decorations to unsuspecting desperate people, which enacts a curse: if the hapless victim cannot collect enough golden rings by a deadline, they will turn into a living glass miniature, forever! Like, bummer!Needless to say, plenty of Christmas shenanigans ensue, all based around The Twelve Days of Christmas song. So, can Chris, Carol, Joy, Nick and Holly round up all the rings, dodge the Christmas dangers, and live to save the holiday (and maybe win the neighborhood decorations contest)?You'll have to watch to find out! Some other supporting players include some sketch comedy alumni (Chris Redd, Robin Thede, David Alan Grier, Nick Offerman) who get to offer an assortment of quips and jabs during the proceedings.""Candy Cane Lane"" is a perfectly acceptable family-friendly Christmastime film. Murphy and Ross do well as the leads, with a nice rapport between them. Murphy seems to generally rein in his improv instincts and generally sticks to the script by Kelly Younger. In fact, any number of instances where a character is about to curse there's an interjection involving a holiday song, which seems to be a deliberate in-joke about the characters Murphy was known for playing early in his career. Ross, by now a longtime television comedic actress, does well in what could have been a thankless and colorless role. There's plenty of good soundtrack music choices, and the special effects are excellent. Several sequences will find younger kids really entertained.Check it out, and have fun!~hypestyle rated 8/10 on 3 December 2023"," Wanted to give it a higher rating...: I have been a long time fan of Eddie Murphy and although I haven't always found him as funny as I hoped, his roles have always been charming enough to satiate my expectations.I started this movie with bridled expectations. The camera work and lighting in this movie is really nice, the effects were also quite well done, and I enjoyed some of the music, though I did notice that some of the music sounded like generic loops from Garage Band were used.Where this movie fell apart was the story and delivery. The story felt forced, where it needed more fleshing out and new characters seemed to drop from the sky and clash with the story instead of interweaving.The characters were also annoying, with some just being outright vulgar and some screaming their lines as if screaming somehow validated their dialogue.Eddie Murphy and his family seemed disconnected from each other, as if there had been a miscast of the actors. Their dialogue was shallow and the most disappointing thing was that it wasn't delivered with convincing tone and body language.The movie had all the trappings of all of the common commercialized Christmas movies that are being released now days, case in point there were two prominent cans of brand-name paint on display in one of the first scenes of the movie.This will not be a movie that I add to my yearly watch list by no means.~compmend-60164 rated 3/10 on 1 December 2023"," Horribly Acted, Horribly Written: This was a complete waste of time. I can't believe Eddie Murphy took this gig. Didn't he read the script first? Bad jokes and over-acting by a third rate supporting cast, and Murphy honestly seemed to not care. Either that, or there was only so much he could do with his pathetic lines. He seemed to be phoning it in. I really like him, and hope he gets something better to work with.Special effects were awkward. Lines ended nowhere with a thud. Also, a very objectionable anti-Christian joke.I was wondering whether this movie was written by a relative or something. There had to be some reason to put this poor excuse for entertainment on Prime.~dvolk429 rated 1/10 on 5 December 2023", Wish it was better: I wish it was better. The movie has a great look and a great leading cast with Eddie Murphy and Julian Bell. Unfortunately only Julian Bell was funny. I only laughed during her scenes.I think the issue was the story. It wasn't very good and it was boring. I really didn't care what the problem was or what Eddie Murphy was trying to accomplish. The live coverage of Candy Cane lane made no sense and the reporters were terrible actors. The news coverage came out of no where. The movie was a mix of a bunch of bad parts and recycled stories. If it's going to recycle a story it needs to be as good as the original or better. I don't ever want to see this movie again.~007Waffles rated 5/10 on 14 December 2023
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023) - IMDb,6.4,Thandiwe Newton|Zachary Levi|Bella Ramsey|Imelda Staunton|Lynn Ferguson|David Bradley|Jane Horrocks|Romesh Ranganathan|Daniel Mays|Josie Sedgwick-Davies|Peter Serafinowicz|Nick Mohammed|Miranda Richardson|Angela Christofilou|Rebekah Hinds,Sam Fell,Karey Kirkpatrick|John O'Farrell|Rachel Tunnard,"Having pulled off an escape from Tweedy's farm, Ginger has found a peaceful island sanctuary for the whole flock. But back on the mainland the whole of chicken-kind faces a new threat, and Ginger and her team decide to break in."," Man, I wanted to LOVE this one: Aardman Animations, personally, is a hit or miss for me as in the past, they have created some great works like Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and so forth. But at the same time, they have made some pretty mediocre or pretty bad works too. ""Chicken Run"" is one of my favorite stop-motion movies as I really like the characters, the animation, and the narrative. With this sequel coming out after many years, it was entertaining but it was a bit underwhelming.Throughout, the stop-motion animation, character models, and colors are amazing as Aardman continues to provide great clay animation. Aardman always provides some great animation and the models, colors, sound designs, and the movements are all excellent. We get to see the same characters from the previous movie and it was fun to see them communicate, move around and observe their actions throughout. The voice performances from the cast members were solid as they provided some good voice works, although a few voice performances weren't great. The soundtrack is pretty good and there are some decent humor moments that I chuckled at.With the narrative continuing from the previous movie, the narrative explores some new concepts and territories within the setting and characters and there are some aspects that were interesting but some not so much. Certain new concepts that were explored I felt weren't strong enough and at times, it really feels like a rehash of the first movie. On the characters, there are new characters that are introduced but unfortunately, none of the new characters weren't really interesting since they felt a bit dull and kind of annoying at times. Because this is a new cast, I personally felt while the original characters are still fun, the chemistry and energy of what made them fun from the first movie felt a bit lacking. The soundtrack is okay and there are some solid dialogue moments while being a bit clunky.Despite my gripes, I still was interested to see where the movie goes and for what it is, it's a decent sequel. Overall, it is entertaining and it's nice to see the characters again, but I wish it could have been better.~chenp-54708 rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Not worth the wait.: There are some prequels or sequels that no one asked for, but end up being happy that they happened anyway.This sadly isn't one one of them.I was already upset by the fact that many of the core voice actors were being replaced. Mel Gibson I could understand for obvious reasons, but the excuse for Julie Sawalha's exclusion was not acceptable. I do believe the real reason was because Sawalha is no longer famous, while Thandi (or Thandiwe) Newton, her replacement, is a big name in the industry. This is a growing trend in modern animation where famous actors are favoured to voice cartoon characters rather than actual voice actors.At one point Ginger fearfully says ""that voice!"" before the reveal of the return of Mrs Tweedy. It would have been extremely awkward if Miranda Richardson was no longer voicing the villain.The story itself is a little too similar to the first Chicken Run and the animation looks too shiny and CGIed, despite most of it being clay-animation. The stakes were not really as high, and the characters were not as fleshed out as they were in the first film.My favourite character is still Fowler, as he was still hilarious. And unlike the new voices for the other main characters, David Bradley does a great job here.The humour in the first film was intelligent and witty. But despite most of the film still being proudly British (even including a chicken character with a Scouse accent), the magic and the passion found in the first film has dampened down quite a lot here.Kids will no doubt enjoy it. But after 23 years, I wasn't all that impressed.~Avwillfan89 rated 6/10 on 18 December 2023"," A decent sequel: For me, this sequel was a decent continuation of the original. It was based on the same concept as the original with some minor additions.The story was simple and light hearted just like the original, the screenplay was decent, the direction was decent, the animation was unique like the original and the voice actors did a good job. The thrill elements were embedded nicely in the story which makes this normal story little bit enjoyable.But to be honest, I think this sequel was unnecessary as it was underwhelming if we compare it to the original. Overall, this movie was a decent entertainer.~akshatmahajan rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Same Mistakes as Early Man: Looks like the creators didn't learn anything from the failure of Early Man (2018). A successful family animation needs to engage folks of any and all ages - the first Chicken Run did to a good extent. This one didn't. Ditto Early Man.Audiences want to see relatable settings, characters with soul, plots that are realistically challenging (not pointlessly ridiculous). So we end up with a colourful bland bright happy island commune ... overdone, unrelatable and boring. Then we get a silly super high tech robots and gadgets filled chicken farm/factory - huh? And football matches in prehistoric Early Man? Huh?From the short documentary on 'the making of' its immediately clear the creators and team spent a massive 99% effort on the puppeting, the sets, the lighting, the movements, the look of things - which is fine, except, where's the effort on the story, the characters, the soul of the whole thing??The director even laughed at how fun it was to give Ms Tweedy a glam look - but hello mister - did you ask yourself what the viewers want out of a once iconic scary evil character like her? A glam up look? Really?It does seem all the people involved in this - many very competent in their area of specialty - was more focused on putting out their best on producing their area of specialty than making an animated movie that truly relates to the audience.For instance so much technical deal and effort was made of Tweedy walking down glass steps - if the story and plotting was better it wouldn't have mattered if she was walking down milk carton cutouts with average lighting and a less smooth gait.Do please spend more thought and effort on plotting and characters and audience impact, and less on the visual razzle dazzle.~charles-limcw rated 5/10 on 20 December 2023"," No charm, feels corporate?: Say what you want about the man but Mel Gibson is sorely missed, that was one of many mistakes this movie made. Flat, boring, pretty, but not fun. The original stands as a childhood favorite that I've watched with my kid many times but nugget of whatever, will be forgotten in a week. Yet another in a long list of agenda filled Netflix blunders. When will they learn? (Side note about Netflix as a production company: finally canceling my subscription after ANOTHER price hike, removing Christmas movies around the holidays, while other services put them behind pay walls is just a greedy, disgusting practice imo, streaming is out of control and people are finding alternatives)~abestrat rated 4/10 on 15 December 2023"," Mission Impossible chicken style.: This sequel to 'Chicken Run' arrives after 23 years, but don't worry, being animated the returning cast haven't aged a bit! Although the story picks up where the original left off, this is an entirely new adventure and you don't really have to see the first film to follow the story, although it is highly recommended. The opening to 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget' recaps the events of the first film in a nutshell.The chickens are living happily on an island away from humans, and Ginger and Rocky starts a family. Their daughter is Molly. No sooner has she become a teenager than she becomes curious about the world and what lies on the other side of the lake. When trucks arrive and start clearing the forest, the chickens devise a plan to shelter themselves from human vision, but Molly wants to explore...and so she does.She befriends a chicken named Frizzle, and together the head to Fun-Land Farms where they believe chickens to live happy lives, according to an advert they saw. Off course the farms are not what it seems, and they soon get into trouble.It's up to Ginger, Rocky and some of their friends to save them. Last time they broke out of a chicken farm; this time they're breaking in. A familiar antagonist from the first film returns, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.I enjoyed the stop-motion animation, the characters, their adventures, and the humour. This is a delightful film young and old can enjoy. The film also illustrates how the younger generation are not always appreciative of what their parents went through to ensure their survival, and I don't think youngsters watching this will fully understand. These are lessons a mature audience will relate to.As much as I enjoyed 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget', I enjoyed 'Chicken Run' more, because it was simpler and funnier.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," Human chickens or chicken humans?: I was keen to see this movie, as I loved the original Chicken Run.It's a long time since the first movie, so naturally the voice actors have changed. This was OK, except I thought Thandiwe Newton sounded a bit too "" posh"" to play Ginger. I got used to it (love Thandiwe!), but I did miss Julia Sawalha and I think the original had a better cast.The main problem for me was the way the chickens are now portrayed. In the first movie, they were hens living at a poultry farm, having to lay a certain number of eggs each day, or risk getting topped by the farmer's wife. So they were basically chickens living like chickens. What made it amusing, of course, was the hens' human qualities, and the fact that whole thing ran like the satirisation of a prisoner-of-war escape movie.However in the sequel, all pretence at ""chicken life"" has gone; the chickens live exactly like humans, and are in effect just humans who look like chickens. Egg laying is a rare event; it's all farming and building and lounging in deck chairs sipping drinks. The spivvy rats with their dodgy goods are now lovable. And to make matters worse, Rocky and Ginger have a ghastly brat of a kid called Molly.As the plot of this movie is also pretty weak, I found it hard to get involved. God forgive me, I was dying for Molly to get turned into a chicken nugget.Didn't work for me. I find it hard to care about chickens who have turned into humans.~KittyG26 rated 2/10 on 16 December 2023"," Nowhere near as good as the original but still really good: Diminishing returns are in full effect with Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, a harmless film that's filled with good messages about parenting even if they've all been done before. It's only sporadically funny but it gets away with it thanks to its stop motion claymation which is increasingly rare to see and just a gift to have.Recasting Mel Gibson makes sense and replacing Julia Sawalha really doesn't. That being said Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi do a good job of making the swap as seamless as possible. Bella Ramsey's Molly is a welcome addition with the ideal amount of childlike wonder and yearning for more in life.Sam Fell's direction gets so much mileage out of the claymation. This form of animation requires so much care and patience which makes everything better. The only slight issue is how clean everything is. Generally it's just really vibrant and clearly very polished which feels like it comes at the cost of losing the original's style.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," Insincere and forced: The stop motion is always on point. Impressive, when you think about how much time goes into it.If you work really hard, you can probably scrape together some respect for the production, but that might be the only feeling you can evoke. The voice acting isn't great, and not just because the original actors are missing. There's a strange disconnect between the animation and the acting, it feels insincere and forced.The story is nothing new, and it should have been. It should have broke new ground just as the original did. It really feels like they put no effort into creating an original plot and just clung to the coat tales of the first film. Seems like a bad choice.I want to write something positive about it but I don't really know what that could be. I guess Bella Ramsey was good casting. I'm only giving it 5 stars because I appreciate the time it takes to make stop motion.~neomastanford rated 5/10 on 15 December 2023"," Yikes this is bad: I don't know what to say, I've been looking forward to this for ages and after watching it, Wow!The voice acting is awful, they've changed some of the original actors and they're not even close, it's jarring, whoever voices Ginger is awful, talk about phoning in a performance and Rocky sounds like a completely different character.The animation looks like made for TV stuff, really cheap and devoid of the originals charm, the story is okay and will no doubt keep kids occupied but for adults, there's nothing here where as the first one had loads of adult humour.This is far from the worst thing I've seen but Wow is it a massive step down from the original, really disappointing. Still good to see Mrs Tweedy return though so that's at least one plus.~phantasmda rated 3/10 on 15 December 2023"

I honestly took a step back when I first saw this. I am ALWAYS extremely critical of movies lately, especially since recently Illumination, Disney, and even a recent Dreamworks movie have fallen flat, but wow!This is truly a family film that is appealing to ALL audiences. Kids have laughs at gags, adults have entertainment from parenting and general themes, and they even poke fun at grandparents, who still are made out to be cool and fun-loving by the end.From both a filmmaker and huge movie fan's perspective, it is extremely refreshing to see a kids movie have good values, no explicit themes, and still be very entertaining! The story and plot was well worked out and everything made sense. The music was fantastic (a solid original score, no spammed pop music like most kids movies). The animation was adorable and very enjoyable to watch. It was also super refreshing to see new/underground talents showcased! A lot of less known names but a fantastic job done (especially the voice actors)!I'm really impressed and wish to express from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making such a great family film, creating a safe space for families to enjoy a movie without oversexualized themed, over the top toilet humor, extreme violence, etc. 9/10!!!~joe_jr rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," A production that makes the most of its potential and successfully achieves a story of family unity and dignity.: ""Migration"" is an excellent animated film whose script tells a story with familiar and educational touches, setting an example of dignity towards immigrants, all from the perspective of the ducks.

It isn't pretentious and doesn't bang on the drum of morality. Rather its pure fun and hijinks.It starts off with the dad trying to scare the kids out of ever wanting to leave the pond, but in a very fun and funny opening. All is good for over protective dad until some exotic ducks land for a stop on their migratory flight south and fill the kids and mum with ideas about migrating to Jamaca. Dad tries to stop but is convinced to overcome his fears and take a chance.And that is the only moral part of the story, take a chance in life and face your fears and prejudices.From there on it's one rollercoaster of aride with lots of fun bits.Also, unlike a lot of animations, you aren't playing the game of oh that is such and such voice. The only really recognisable voice is Danny Divitto, who is perfectly cast as grumpy uncle Dan. The kids are relative unknowns but are perfect in timing and emotion.The animation is colourful but doesn't overwhelm the film either like some animation do.It also isn't overly long which is great and kids will love it and parents get lots of laughs.Yes it's not ground breaking but that's not the point.A perfect family fare, perfect for Christmas/ holidays.~reeceagland rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Migration"": A Heartwarming Animated Adventure Packed with Laughter and Life Lessons: I couldn't resist the chance to watch ""Migration"" ahead of its Boxing Day release date. From start to finish, my love for ""Migration"" only grew stronger. The film is an absolute delight - it's not just super cute and funny, but it's also packed with heartwarming moments that tug at your emotions. The characters bring such warmth and charm that you can't help but be drawn into their world.Beyond the humor and cuteness, ""Migration"" delivers a great message to stop waiting for life to happen to you. The animation is nothing short of fantastic, bringing the story to life with vibrant visuals and captivating sequences. ""Migration"" is a perfect blend of laughter, heart, and visual brilliance that makes it a must-watch for animation enthusiasts of all ages.~cutie7 rated 7/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not Half Bad: Overall, not a half bad illumination movie.The movie's environments were beautiful. Easily my favorite part of the movie. I loved the watercolor-esque trees. Also, the designs of some of the humans, especially the main antagonist, are pretty nice and creative. The jokes weren't nearly as ""cringey"", and landed for the most part. (hah, get it, cause the movies about ducks... migrating). The humor in this movie feels more family-focused, rather than purely for the kids.As for the negatives, the story is fairly linear, and not too interesting. The overall theme is very obvious, so it isn't too deep. All in all, a typical illumination movie.Overall, a decent Illumination movie. Just plain family fun. If you want to be fairly entertained, and laugh with your kiddos, this is a good movie.~OddityReviewsStuff rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre: I recently watched the movie Migration (2023) in theaters with my daughter. The storyline follows a northeastern family of ducks 🦆 who encounter a flock of migrating birds that invite them to fly south for the winter. Despite their usual winter stay, the family convinces the dad to fly to Jamaica 🇯🇲 this year, and an adventure ensues.This movie is co-directed by Benjamin Renner (Ernest & Celestine) and Guylo Homsy (Eddie's Life Coach) and features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Danny DeVito (Twins), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians), Keegan-Michael Key (Wonka), and Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games).The animation in this picture is outstanding, while the rest of the film is fairly average. The storyline is straightforward, with a few worthwhile subplots. I particularly enjoyed the husband and wife working together through various circumstances for the betterment of the family. The voices are well selected, and Awkwafina and DeVito comedic content keep the film well-paced. The conclusion is as expected, though its sequel potential remains uncertain.In conclusion, Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 December 2023"," Great for adults and kids - clean and entertaining family film: The animation is colorful, action starts relatively early and is well spaced-out. The jokes were appropriate. My kids are aged 10 and 14, they both enjoyed it. There were kids of all ages in the theatre and I could hear laughs all the time. Perfect for the holidays and also has a great soundtrack.The storyline is obvious in the title, but the journey was full of surprises enough to keep you on the edge. There were useful lessons to be learned and a morale to the story.The last film I had seen at the cinema was Super Mario and ""Migration"" has delivered the same clean family entertainment that we have been missing.Highly recommended.~m_al_saeed rated 10/10 on 16 December 2023"," Suprisingly decent: I went with low expectations about this film because the trailers looked like the movie wasn't good, but after watching it i can say it's really worth the ticket.Visually there's nothing to complain about here the ducks and all kinds of birds that appear here look nice and are really expresive.Soundwise nothing outstanding, decent, you can hear every character clearly because all was mixed well. The ambient for all scenarios is done pretty well too (Swamps, cities, forrest)Storywise This is what i liked the most because it's not that dumb for an illumination movie, it has drama and funny moments throughout the entire run, but nothing too deep, just enough to be entertaining.I would say if you go alone or with your family you'll have a good time.~mackarron rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Migrate To This One With Your Flock! Capital Fun That Just Needed A Bit More: LIKES:Good Pace-The movie doesn't get lost in sitting around and stewing on the adventure, but rather gets the world established and ready to leap into the adventure within about 15 minutes-Once they take off, the movie keeps to a good pace that is fun, well-timed, and never getting too stuck in one place that it becomes too boring or off-putting of the story-And yet, the movie doesn't do the Fast and Furious approach of putting the petal to the metal and flooring through it to cram jokes.-Instead it does a nice job of giving that adventure nature and still respecting the character development and plot to help make this a movie that is far above the Nick Jr. And Disney Jr. Elements.Fantastic Animation-It might not be the highest grade in terms of realism, but Animation still shows how other studios than Disney can make cartoons come to life.-Ducks fly and soar in the style that mimics the natural movements of the ducks and other birds, in their steps, dives, and swoops. It's great attention to detail and part of the magic that animators make.-then comes the human elements in their forms, and what a surprise to see such great adaptations in the small fowl forms is humorous , charming, and just cute at times and brings the energy that this movie thrives on.-Wrap this all together and the smoothness of the animation is going to easily keep your eyes on the festivities of this dynasty in their migration to whatever they are searching for in their journey.-And the design with that goofy look on their faces that Illumination does adds more than takes away, sort of a subtle level that adds funny with little effort.Great Humor-A staple to these movies for me is to laugh and hope that I get more than just kid humor and cute sound effects and one liners.-Migration had my back and did not disappoint with the material presented and more so how appropriate it sticks to the rating they gave it.-Yes, there are plenty of the tropes for kids, silly smashing, lots of random lines, and annoying sounds that are going to be repeated.-Yet, the movie feels a bit like Bluey, actually geared towards adults with plenty of their perspective to help color this film in a shade that was far more enjoyable-Bed time stories gone wrong to help make a point, sarcasm that just sticks and matches the emotion so well that the combination of visual and sound are unbeatable for me.-And there are even a few jokes hidden within that for you to enjoy and find, that little extra sauce that makes this movie fun for all.-It's also balanced and well implemented, never getting to lost to overshadow everything else this movie achieves, again a part of the fun, not the whole fun that still gives an engaging story.The Opening Short:-It's of course geared to the Despicable Me audience, but the small tale and short is very fun and a little side story that curbs you to the Gruniverse.-I enjoyed the simple tale that bridges the gap, adds that silly level of humor found in that movie franchises, and was a nice bridge to warm us up.-One character is a surprise to see, but with them comes a funny Looney Tunes like motion that was very enjoyable, if not a tad long.Family Friendly, But Adult-This movie again can mirror the craze of Bluey in my eyes.-It's family friendly, easily watchable by all ages, but yet not so juvenile that older adults are going to be looking at their phones or fingernails to entertain themselves.-That humor I mentioned is one element, but the fact there are such great storytelling elements and character development really help make this movie easily more entertaining and relevant to the masses.-To have that balance helps really give the movie rewatchability to see what else you can find with the wit and cleverness of the animators' imaginations.Good Character Usage-And again, a good movie is loaded with engaging characters, and even more so using those characters to justify their inclusion is big for a reviewer like me.-Migration again succeeds in this task, granting you characters that are colorful in look and design, but also in personality and story.-The main flock is of course the stars, but surprisingly there is a lot of secondary characters that get some fantastic screen time, with a purpose and engagement that just doesn't tag them along for the ride.-The antagonist might not say much, but it doesn't matter, because even he has enough merit into his inclusion, and enough menace to fit in without being too much.-It's impressive to see them do this where others struggle, but applause for what hey crammed into about a 90 minute run time.Voice Acting-The crown jewel for me is the voices that brought so many characters to life and delivered that comedic punch with the haymaker that had me laughing.-The writing might be good, but I loved the execution as well, with just about everyone delivering solid performance.-DeVito needs more lines, but what he pulls off is perfect for the curmudgeon duck, with just that touch of dry sarcasm and lack of energy that is balanced so well.-Banks was that calming factor, her raspy and controlling voice a nice contrast to help calm the theatrics of the comical birds in this movie, and add that touch of different humor to the mi to help keep things diverse.-However, it is Nanjiani that was the best. His voice was made for an animated dock, so aggressive, high pitched, raspy, and that element of awkward composure that makes the humor so fun. And yet, still has the air of caring that leads to a great character that I enjoyed watching across the board.DISLIKES:More Needed-The adventure was great, but again, there seemed to be more needed to finish this migration to the South.-This film did the trick on many levels, but at the end of the movie, the adventure seemed to end a little faster and quicker than I expected.-Surely more things could have been done, or maybe not skip quite as much and lead to three minute montage to get home, especially given one last fun thing that could have been that last touch.-Throw in some of the other characters getting a little more development given the trauma they faced and well... I kind of would have liked to see that execution.-Minor to some, and moderate to others, a little more engaging design, even at the cost of the short, could have helped take this a bit further.Gwen Gets A Tad annoying-She might be the most adorable character, but it doesn't mean that she was my favorite.-Gwen's whininess at times is cute, but often is annoying to me, the high squeals, the excessive jokes of embarrassment, and the impatience just grating my nerves.-Her humor is definitely more like a kid focus approach and at times it works, but it was much lost on me and she gets a tad overwhelming for someone like me who just doesn't enjoy bratty kids.More Character Development-It started so well and I think that the movie kept most of this up, but... again there was still some elements that needed tinkering.-Some more challenges and merit to take the ducks to a new level and help them not have such an abrupt change.-In this type of movie, it's not quite as important to the key demographic, but with just that touch more story building could have taken this to the level of some of my favorite movies.The VERDICT:I really enjoyed my time with Migration, and found this animated feature to be quite engaging for me and many of the members in my showing. The animation is solid, cartoony and goofy, which works to capitalize on the writing and humor loaded into this journey. With that balance of adult and kid, the movie caters to all ages and should assist with making a movie that should keep the attention for the 90 minutes. A sensational voice cast and lots of time with the characters, only further brings out the fun and I really just had a fun time soaring through the skies through this quirky little family. Sure, more development could have helped add that added spice, and there could have been a few more engaging challenges and less Gwen. Yet, the movie still shines as an entertaining piece and I encourage this one in theaters for a fun outing, or at the least a watch at home.My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0.~rgkarim rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," Cute but trite: Been there, seen it.

I read the negative postings on every film I see, and it's amazing to me how much energy people put into picking apart what's intended to be a holiday entertainment. Especially these days with the advance in computer generated effects. There used to be a time when clay-mation was the rage, and how realistic was that? How about considering the message - I for one would be darned upset if there was no more magic left in the world. It's evident every time my little two year old granddaughter runs in the room and tells her gaga (that would be me), to 'sit' so we could play or watch a movie like this together. This one got around to showing 'Santy', and you have to marvel when a mere child sits enthralled by the spectacle of color and motion the way it's presented here. For a while during my adult life, there was probably a time when I didn't hear that bell, but as I get older the sound is coming back, even as my hearing diminishes. I guess you'd call it the magic of kids and Christmas together, and you can count me in when the conductor calls 'All Aboard'.~classicsoncall rated 7/10 on 19 December 2010"," Enchantment, thrills, spectacle...looks great on DVD...: On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, ""The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,"" we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely ""get it"".Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job.~Doylenf rated 9/10 on 22 November 2004"," Will Become A Christmas Classic: I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.I had reservations about the use of CGI animation since I felt it really only worked for stories about cute animals but having seen the film, the CGI was the best way to capture the spirit of the film. It really wouldn't have worked as well in live action, the sense of other-worldly magic would have been lost. And as it was, the artwork was beautiful, especially the snowy mountainous scenery that the train passes through.This film took me back to my childhood and that tingly-feeling every child gets on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa's visit. The story was sweet and innocent without being nauseating, and I think every one of us can empathise with the boy who wants to believe in Santa but is growing away from the innocence of early childhood and faith in magic. Much like Raymond Briggs' 'The Snowman', I predict 'The Polar Express' will go down as a Christmas classic. It certainly makes a pleasant change that this year's Christmas film was actually about Christmas and I hope they make the re-release of this film an annual Christmas event.~cosmic_quest rated 9/10 on 20 December 2004"," It is a very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable: Directed by veteran Robert Zemeckis, It is a production that unveils, throughout its 100 minutes, the story of an American boy in the late 1950s. By witnessing the polar express stop at his door, the young man will have the most fantastic experience of his life. Life, something that will mark him forever and allow his belief in Christmas, not as firm as one would expect for a child, to become even more solid. Initially reticent, the young man agrees to leave on the train that takes him on a tour full of incredible adventures. Each piece of territory crossed is a different learning experience, marked by its still incipient trajectory. He fights with Scrooge, the famous evil Christmas spirit, immortalized by the literature of Charles Dickens, passes by the famous Polar Aurora, a place with the optical phenomenon due to the brightness observed in the night skies of the polar regions, due to the impact of particles of solar wind with the high atmosphere of the earth, channeled by the magnetic field of our planet, that is, an impressive visual spectacle that leaves no one indifferent.In the face of conflicts, as it is worth mentioning, the boy no longer believes in Santa Claus, the narrative becomes an allegory for the need to believe and invest in the ""so"" Christmas spirit. We check with some resistance, because the foot in reality does not allow us to surrender too much to the utopias proposed by the American cinematographic discourse. However, one of the ""tasks"" of art is precisely to allow us to clarify reality through fictional proposals, thus, the ticket to enter the world of Zemecks film is ""bought"" by all those who indulge in the charms of art. Narrative that unfolds before our eyes, a set of scenes built using visually incredible resources.Zemeckis's filmography is known for playing with the ludic, and here it is no different. The script to be well digested by the viewer needs to be seen as a story about magic and aborted beliefs. Alan Silvestri's music helps to punctuate this feeling that life in the eyes of a child is more beautiful, even if that child no longer believes in legendary figures, as is the case with the central character. In ""The Polar Express"" we have a short, simple and objective plot. The director's intention was never to create a work of art in the plot with this film, but to prove that you can rescue barbaric feelings and emotions with the Christmas theme. Now imagine Tom Hanks facing five different roles in the same film. Imagine? Something very crazy to think about, mainly because the ""motion capture"" technique (technique used to make the character Gollum from the series ""The Lord of the Rings, for example) was used, which captured all of Hanks' movements and transferred them to the computer, mixing reality and animation, fantasy and flesh and blood beings. The actor plays a boy who does not believe in the Christmas spirit, his father, a locomotive driver, a stroller and Santa Claus himself. It is a versatility never seen in the world of movie theaters.This technique was used in a magnificent way for the sake of narrative. To get an idea of what was done, all the actors in the film acted in front of an empty screen, with motion capture sensors attached throughout their bodies. The data from these sensors were passed on to computers and served as a template for the creation of the character in the film itself. As these sensors were responsible for capturing movements and facial expressions, the actors did not necessarily have to have the same body as the character. This allowed Hanks to play five different characters. And look, it was not easy to shape all of his expressions, so much so that the work lasted almost a year. The interesting thing was to see Steven Tyler, vocalist of the band Aerosmith, as Elf singing a song at the end of the film. Very funny! They managed to capture the essence of their appearance (big mouth and ears)!The film makes use of a very new advent for its time, and at least the main character is very excited. Already adults and peripheral child characters are astonishing to look at. This is thanks to the concept of Uncanny Valley, which preaches that figures that imitate human beings when they approach what man is become strange. The dialogues and interactions are quite artificial, but not as much as the attempts to make musical numbers. The waiters who serve the wagons are so tough that they look like imitations of androids. This issue is somewhat appeased by the parties involving animals running, flying and interacting with the typical things in the scenarios. Wolves and eagles represent more than just animals typical of North American fauna, and result in representatives of the work's sense of adventure. The criticisms received at the time of the launch, stoning the flesh-and-bone characters, their lackluster movement, their rubberized look and their glazed eyes, forgot the most important component of any short story: simplicity and narrative poetry.And although the visual is the only really negative point of this technique, like ignoring the perfection of Zemeckis's camera, it went through, following in the smallest details the movement of a lost golden ticket and the travellings that lead us nimbly in and out of the train, especially during the free fall on the tracks and crossing the thin ice? The option for elegant frames also stands out, and the counter-plongée, which accompanies the little boy's belief through the frozen floor, not only dignifies the moment but anticipates the arrival of Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the photograph by Don Burgess and Robert Presley is breathtaking - as shown in the image below -, and the intense gold of the train ticket or the lighting of the bonfire on the face of a Beggar, the angel presents in the vast majority of people. Christmas stories, is enough to make a beautiful Christmas story shine.At the end of the projection, we were left with the feeling that Zemeckis achieved his goal, of combining technology and magic in the same product. He, who is admittedly one of the directors who most seek to develop and perfect techniques and technologies, ends up creating a plastically flawless film, transposing to the screen with admirable perfection the engravings from Allsburg's book. Zemeckis also creates practically unimaginable plans and sequences, in a brutal effort to want to innovate. Zemeckis also loves to make references to other films. This time, he made the children's classic ""The Fantastic Chocolate Factory"", starring Gene Wilder. The ticket that gives access to the train is golden, just like in the classic movie. In addition to similarities like the big chocolate factory, the gift factory or even the driver with the funny Willy Wonka.Assuming a metalinguistic tone on purpose - the Conductor, one of the characters voiced by Tom Hanks, refers sensibly to abandoned toys - and accidentally - Ebenzer Scrooge's puppet would serve as a mold some years later for the personification of the classic character by Jim Carey, O Polar Express culminates in the detail plan of a hand bell, which is much more than the complete proof of the fantastic journey, it is the true Christmas spirit within each one of us. The inner child who screams and cries out for the sincere remembrance of his attachment to the beautiful illusion of the good old man, of the communion of gifts and brotherly love, whose sound materializes in the tinkling of the bell at the ear of the, now adult, little boy.On the other hand, it is noticeable that the biggest problem of The Polar Express is not so much its innovative and uncomfortable aspect - something crucial for a Christmas plot - and its plot, common and obvious. The protagonist is a boy who is starting to stop believing in Santa Claus. He is growing up, and with that, forgetting the magic of childhood. The events in The Polar Express take place in a very traditional and unoriginal way. There are not many news or discoveries: everything goes very smoothly, without scares or surprises. The few moments of suspense and tension soon dissipate, and normality then dictates the course of action again. The impression is that he devoted a lot of time to the appearance of the film and very little to the development of the script.The film itself looks more like a roller coaster. You will have fun watching the ups and downs of the trip, with exciting moments and action sequences where the beauty of the most magical time of the year is paramount, while others are strange and out of place, like the setting of children singing songs. At least when the final season arrives, the home of Santa Claus, the magical character is rescued with a sequence of events that show the intimacy of the elven officials, including the architecture of miniature houses since they are small. There comes a moment in the film that is surreal to imagine that a boy can walk on top of a moving train, but it does not bother you because you are already involved in the fantasy atmosphere provided by the characters.The care with the visuals of sets and costumes of the inhabitants of the magical place breaks the skepticism of the central character of The Polar Express too much, and this is certainly a film that has a lot of audacity, being a pioneer in many points that would become quite common in children's productions. And adults later on. The movement capture technique, new at the time, brings to the film the combination of ""real images"" and animation, in one of the most surprising Christmas cinematic experiences in the history of cinema. In addition, The Polar Express is a very, very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable. Still, it is a beautiful production about friendship and how we should, without being too deluded, cultivate our dreams, with a view to making our existence more bearable.~fernandoschiavi rated 7/10 on 20 May 2021"," What's with all the hate for this movie?: This is one of the better Christmas movies I've ever watched. It's fantastic. I watched this again after ages and right after 'A boy called Christmas' which I didn't like at all. You could say that I watched this to cleanse my eyes because that movie is quite bad.It's an amazing fantasy Christmas movie with spectacular animation. Tom Hanks' animated character looks just like him. I didn't find the other characters as jarring as people claim them to be. The film's animation is so good that it's easy to overlook the ""creepy"" looking characters.The film has extremely breathtaking visuals, gripping scenes, a jolly atmosphere. It also has songs which is really fantastic and something that happens to be missing from Christmas films including'A boy called Christmas'. The moral that this movie has is also quite beautiful. So overall a really great movie to watch during Christmas. All this hate is just not justified.~eldreddsouza rated 8/10 on 12 December 2021"," My childhood: When I was a kid I watched this like, a million times.

I would want a train like that go by my home~xuanbacht rated 10/10 on 22 January 2019"," It Just Keeps Getting Better: ""Wow!"" I found myself saying this over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. It continually amazes me how far computer animation has come in the last decade. Each time I think I've seen the most beautiful or amazing artwork, something better - like this - comes along. I couldn't believe how good this looked on my flat-screen TV. I can't imagine how good it must appear on an expensive plasma television.The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene. The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling. Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem.The only drawback I found were the kids in the story. Most of them were not anyone you could really warm up to, except for the girl and she was so overtly politically correct it was sickening and an insult to anyone's intelligence. A black girl was NOT in the book but the typically-Liberal filmmakers not only change that character but make her the only one in the film with absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's so sweet she makes Mother Teresa sound like The Grinch. None of the kids in the film, however, were brats or annoying. The only funny kid was the nerd, of course. PC baloney aside, this was fabulous entertainment. Tom Hanks did a great job voicing over five characters and I've just simply never a better-looking film than this.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 29 November 2005"," Just get real folks: Come on, guys. This film was made at a time when these visuals were still groundbreaking. Don't complain now that they were not as far along then as they are today.

Now and back then.~tin-whistle rated 7/10 on 5 January 2022"," wonderful holiday film: So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful ""The Grinch"". Having grown up with the book ""The Polar Express"" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for ""Polar Express"" to be a complete wreck. But instead It soared. Completely. What makes the film such a success is not so much even the story itself, but an execution which somehow manages to inject every frame of the film with a feeling of childlike wonder and exuberance. In addition, there are so many clever touches and details added throughout that a feeling of mystery and excitement just fills the viewer. Among these are the waiters dancing and singing while serving hot chocolate to the kids on the train (a very funny scene, as well), the factory where the presents are prepared, and a ghost-like hobo who is never really explained, but is incredibly crucial to the feel of the film. At one point, three of the children wander lost through the empty streets of Santa's North Pole town. As they wander, various old Christmas recordings are heard playing on phonographs throughout the town. The music provides a pleasant and nostalgic ambiance to the scene. It's touches like this that absolutely make the film.I'll never understand why films seem to be required to be at least 90 minutes long. I would pay money to see a 40-minute film, as long as it were good. And even if it sucked, I would have at least wasted less time. What I'm getting at is I have no idea why a 32-page picture book needed to be a 99-minute movie. What this means is that the original story is VASTLY expanded upon. However, what is added in actually fits quite well with the essence and spirit of the book. Some of it is just sheer entertainment; the train track is like a roller coaster, characters ski on top of the cars, danger lurks around every step of the journey to the North Pole (but admittedly fun danger). Other aspects further illuminate and expand upon the book's basic theme of the virtue of belief in the implausible. So I have no idea why this was made into a full-length, but in the end, I'm glad it was. It didn't even feel too long (and I think everything is too long).Much criticism has fallen on the look of the characters in the movie. I can agree to a point. While there is incredible visual detail in the faces, they usually seem void of expression. In general, a lot of the motion seems rather wooden, as well. The scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous. Overall, the minor problems in animation (which really boil down to a matter of taste anyway) are certainly not enough to diminish what is an overwhelmingly successful movie. Score: 8/10~madpenguin41 rated 8/10 on 18 December 2004"," Classic Christmas Film!: Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me.~Sylviastel rated 10/10 on 18 January 2007"

There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning. A semi-autobiographical fantasy from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki."," The Fifth Stage Of Grieving: It's the Second World War, and Mahito's mother has died in a fire bombing. Now his father has announced they are moving to the country where he has set up a factory for fighter planes, and Natsuko is going to be his new mother and she's expecting a child. And, oh yeah, it gradually becomes clear she's Mahito's mother's sister. The maternal estate is large and beautifully landscaped, and there's a strange tower that has been allowed to fall to pieces, along with a family legend about a great-uncle who built the tower where a meteorite struck, and who later vanished.Mahito is upset about all this, and so he injures himself so he won't have to go to school. But he keeps having strange dreams about the grey heron and the tower, and his stepmother driving it off with a bow and arrow..... which he later spots in her room.And all the elderly female servants look like the characters from SPIRITED AWAY. This is all right, because Hayao Miyazaki has come out of retirement again to offer us a parable about how you can have a family, if you're willing to be accepting. Once again, it's filled with giant, evil parakeets, toy balloon animals that float to the moon, and a sense that there are rules in operation here, even if you don't understand them. In the meantime, enjoy the weirdness, and, as always, the magnificent background art.~boblipton rated 8/10 on 3 December 2023"," It's confused, but it got the spirit: Seeing The Boy and The Heron, Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie feels almost like a monumental event in and of itself. It was announced almost as a surprise with the words ""Hayao Miyazaki's last movie"". With this amount of hype, including the amazing reviews it's got from critics, my hype was built up to the max. The end result? Not what I expected, and that's ok!Let's get to the positives, the animation is STUNNING. The way Hayao Miyazaki manages to build these worlds and characters is just an amazing feat, they all come alive with the colours and the movement. Another positive is the tone of the movie, I really hate Disney for trying to market this as a kid's movie, when it's not. It's got some unnerving and scary moments and themes that are not suited for kids, which is good. Hayao Miyazaki is at his best when he manages to blend the adult with the fantastical.The actors are always amazing, I saw the Japanese dub so I don't know how the western VAs are doing but wow; they all do a fantastic job!Now to the negatives... a huge thing about Studio Ghibli movies in general, especially the ones from Hayao Miyazaki, is that they're always by rule driven by the characters, it's their journey that's in the front. World building and narrative always takes a second place in his movies to be able to not distract from the characters journeys, big examples of this are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle where the world building is built by very simple and effective means and rules. But here in the Boy and The Heron the world building is so convoluted and confusing it almost feels like he wanted it to take center stage in this movie and it's such a shame because it feels at like it's at odds with it's own main character who supposedly undergoes a deep deep emotional journey but it all finishes off in a very abrupt and unfitting send-off in the end which really confused me and just didn't feel like a good payoff.Also the way this movie introduces characters left and right with no rhyme or reason is super confusing. Once again, Hayao Miyazaki did this very minimally in his past movies where the characters get room to be explored and to leave an impact in the story but here once again it's at odds with its own world building- it all feels very haphazard and messy. The Heron is a fun character but I don't feel like he or Mahito do or learn anything from these adventures.Now, it may sound like I hated this movie, but I didn't. It's just that I care so much about Hayao Miyazaki movies and Studio Ghibli movies that I can't help to compare them to the movies we've seen before. And despite it not being Hayao Miyazaki's best it's still pretty good, it's very much worth a watch.~danielatala8 rated 7/10 on 25 November 2023"," Complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered: Bombs rain down on the city and in the fire, chaos, and rubble a boy, Mahito, searches for his mom. He hears her voice calling him, but he can't find her. Even when Mahito, his dad, and a new woman move to the countryside, he still hears his mom's voice calling to him from the fire. In dreams and with the encouragement of a mysterious heron, Mahito enters an abandoned and magical tower where he hopes to get clues to his mom's whereabouts. It may be an elaborate trap.This complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered film continues Miyazaki's amazing and awe-inspiring legacy. He is one of my favorite directors. In nature, wisdom about living, magic, charismatic guides (female as well as male), folklore, cute puffball critters, war/chaos, wackiness including flesh-eating parakeets, portals to other worlds, loss, and love, Miyazaki continues to run with favorite and endearing themes. The film is full of insight into what it means to be human. I was so happy to be part of the first audience to see the film outside of Japan.There is depth in the story, characters, music, voices (much better in Japanese), and especially the artwork. I'm mesmerized just by the drawings and movement of the clouds. Oh and there are fantastic and intricately drawn ocean waves, moonlight reflected on water, vivid colors, resplendent contrasts of light and dark, elaborate tree branches, night skies with resplendent stars and meteors, grasses realistically swaying in the wind, alluring shadows, and so much more. The Boy and the Heron is worth watching for the artwork alone.~Blue-Grotto rated 10/10 on 17 September 2023"," What a difference a second viewing makes!: I got the sense watching The Boy and the Heron a second time would help me like it more, but I didn't expect a second viewing to help this much. I would've ranked it maybe #8 or #9 in a Miyazaki ranking after watching it the first time, but now, I think I might honestly rank it as high as #2. The only film of his I definitely like more is Princess Mononoke (that one's a classic - little can touch it).The first time, I was overwhelmed and somewhat confused, but never bored. It's so beautiful to look at that following what was going on felt secondary. The second time around, it's still beautiful, I like the music even more, and also, I have to say, seeing it for a second time with subtitles instead of the dub helped (though the English dub was of pretty good quality, it does have to be said).I looked into how people were interpreting the film following watching it for the first time, I'll admit. I wasn't clever enough to crack the subtext, but the reading that the granduncle is a stand-in for Miyazaki, and the fantastical world represents Miyazaki's work... it's so apparent now. Having that in mind just changed the entire final half-hour for me, and though part of me feels a little slow for not ""getting"" it, I also respect the film not spelling it out, but having it there clear as day once you know that's (almost certainly) the main subtextual element.But even on an emotional level, things just clicked more this time around. Understanding how certain elements of the fantasy world lined up with reality from the start made things more moving and improved the pacing; it was less like a random stream of events, which is kind of how it felt the first time around. I appreciated the protagonist's arc more, I liked the side characters more, and I think I even found more humor (as well as more sadness) in the film the second time around.The Boy and the Heron was still really good after one watch, for the visual and musical elements alone. But the second time around, it was something else. I still think the pacing is a tiny bit slow in places, but I feel that way about every Miyazaki movie. And the ending... I do wish there'd been just something else that happened in that kind of abrupt final scene. But other than those nitpicks, this is an almost-perfect animated film.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 9/10 on 9 December 2023"," Is it bad that I just didn't get it?: I have been recently getting into Studio Ghibli films and I've been impressed. I was highly looking forward to this movie strictly because it was the first time I got the opportunity to see a Miyazaki film on the big screen. And the English dub is studded with talent.I must say... I feel let down. I almost fell asleep halfway through, and the ending didn't make sense. There was so much happening and things weren't explained. I understand that there was probably deep symbolism attached to certain writing choices, but what's the point if the viewer has no idea what they're trying to say?There were some good scenes and some good humor, but overall I feel a little empty.~poseyfan rated 6/10 on 8 December 2023"," Final curtain: I've probably started a review of a Hayao Miyazaki film stating it's his final film before, but ""The Boy and the Heron"", for more reasons than one, certainly feels like the final cut. Now aged eighty-two with an ever-increasing gap between films, it would sadly appear unlikely another feature will be made. ""The Boy and the Heron"" would show that Miyazaki now also knows the gig is up, feeling like a culmination of a life's work, looking backwards rather than forwards.Mahito's (Soma Santoki) mother is killed in a Tokyo fire, and so later goes to live in the countryside with his father and stepmother (also his aunt). His father the owner of an aeronautics factory, he has a large plot to explore, finding a mysterious old building. But he also finds himself stalked by a grey heron (Masaki Suda) who appears to mean him harm.But with his stepmother Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura) going missing, he confronts the heron and the pair go looking for her, finding themselves at the mysterious building of unknown origin. This takes them into worlds within worlds, as they are helped and hindered along the way by various people and creatures.There's a lot going on here, and, it's fair to say, too much. There are some good moments, but this is a film that gets a little lost within itself as it tries to squeeze in too much into its two hours. While there are similarities in all of his films, each has its own unique charm. ""The Boy and the Heron"", however, feels more like a greatest hits parade, with many moments reminiscent of what has come before. You can probably go through the whole film and equate moments to earlier works every step of the way.Whether intentional or not, this can show both a filmmaker struggling for original ideas, but also a messy and convoluted storyline that can become difficult to follow and disengaging. Miyazaki films can almost be made by their moments for reflection, but here you barely feel able to breath as we race into another world of new characters. The result is a film that has some of the confusion and struggles of some of Ghibli's - not just Miyazaki's - lesser works, such as ""The Cat Returns"" (2002) and ""Tales from Earthsea"" (2006).A problem for Miyazaki is that you are judging his films by such high standards, in a career that has never really declined, just become sparse. This is good, but it is by no means great; probably most reminiscent of ""How's Moving Castle"" (2005) in that it tries to open too many doors. Miyazaki is at his best when he keeps things simple, but feels like he's trying to push the magic and wonder here, rather than let it out naturally.Comedy is perhaps the strength of the film, with more outright laughs than I can remember from Miyazaki before. To start, the elderly maids of the country house, while familiar in design, have the mannerisms of excited children, hungry for treats from the big city. Though Suda as the heron is the standout, starting as a squawking threat, but becoming the buddy sidekick and a constant source of humour, as one of Miyazaki's most comical characters.As ever, Joe Hisaishi delivers a memorable soundtrack, with a sparse and simple piano a reminder that Ghibli is at its best when uncomplicated. And simplicity is the word for the somewhat abrupt ending. In a film that has so much going on, the coda is almost notable in its inactivity, and feels like a fitting way to end. A career that has brought so much, should say a quick goodbye and leave us with good memories.Politic1983.home.blog.~politic1983 rated 6/10 on 19 October 2023"," Beautiful Ghibli animation, wonderous magical worlds, moral lessons, a lot of confusion: This is one of the good ones. However it reflects as much the passion and skill of Hayao Miyazaki as his old age confusion. His latest ""last movie"" starts one way and ends (abruptly) another. It has elements from his own life, his previous work and some new ideas, but the gist of the film is reconciling with loss and moving forward, recognizing there isn't much one can do. A very old man mentality in a movie about a child entering a magical world filled with wonder and dream logic.The animation was so beautiful, the story a bit disjointed, but quite captivating. It was the ending that kind of disappointed. This film has been a long time in the making (in 2019 it was 15% complete, allegedly, with Miyazaki directing a minute of the film a month) and it shows.The Japanese title is ""How do you live?"", the same as the Genzaburo Yoshino's instructional coming-of-age novel that Miyazaki's mother gifted him. In the film, the boy finds the book with a message from his dead mother, instructing him to read it, but it never goes anywhere. There are a lot of other hints and symbols that are quite opaque to non-Japanese, so I felt that I've missed chunks of what the movie was supposed to convey.Perhaps the most interesting quality of the film is how easily it can be interpreted multiple ways, the ambiguity both confusing and thought provoking. As we experience dream and child logic we get a glimpse of the transmuted reality underneath. The grief, the loss, the benevolent yet oppressive culture, the futility and pain of war, the missing and missed parenting and so on.Bottom line: is it a masterpiece or a slice of Miyazaki, jumbled beyond recognition? Both. I felt it might be a fitting farewell film, but also that I missed so many meanings from it. I liked it.~siderite rated 8/10 on 18 December 2023"," Visual pleasing, Imaginative world, Very complex story.: If you have never watched a Hayao Miyazaki film, I wouldn't recommend starting with The Boy and the Heron.For an introduction I'd recommend to start with Spirited Away (2001) and Princess Mononoke (1997).If you become amused and the films resonate with you. Then you will enjoy The Boy and Heron. It isn't the strongest of Hayao Miyazaki and Ghibli films but a very good addition to their filmography.The film begins with a slow pace of mostly visually defining the world, characters and their dilemmas. As the movie progresses you see touches of another realm. Before you know it, it becomes a full-blown feverish dream of Hayao Miyazaki imagination and story telling. It eventually comes all together back on its feet at the end.Was it fun and visually pleasing? Yes.Was I confused at times And had a lot of unanswered question? Also yes.~sterlingrobson rated 8/10 on 10 September 2023"," Hayao Miyazaki delivers: Not his best, but a very solid fairy tale from the master with lots of his trademark elements like stoic characters, spirit worlds, flying scenes and characters running through narrow passages.It is stylistically comparable to Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle, although a bit less epic in scope. Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of ""tacked on"". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character.~alex_with_a_P rated 7/10 on 2 November 2023"," Lovely animation...and a very confusing and disjoint story.: I am a big fan of the films of Hayao Miyazaki...so much so that I went out and got a tattoo of his Totoro characters. And, I've seen and enjoyed all his films. So, when I say I didn't particularly like ""The Boy and the Heron""...well, that says a lot.The story is confusing and the ending seems, well, to kind of contradictory. I'll TRY to give a brief overview. The story is set in Japan during the later portion of WWII, though the war seems to play very little part in the story. It begins with a fire in which Mahito's mother is killed. A few years pass and Mahito and his father have moved out to the country because the father's fiancee lives there...plus, it is the war and being in a city was NOT a good thing. Mahito is shocked when a heron begins talking to him...and a weird human-like face emerges from the bill. Eventually, he and the heron enter a weird parallel world caused, apparently, by a strange meteorite and his great-great uncle. What happens next is confusing, so I'll just stop here.So many confusing story elements. Why did Mahito smash a rock against his skull early in the story? Why did the great-great uncle say he wanted Mahito's help...but then Mahito wakes up in chains! And, later, the great-great uncle says how much he likes Mahito...but what about the chains? There were more strange and inexplicable occurrances.While some might say that Miyazaki had made other confusing and difficult films, if you know about Japanese folklore and religion, films like ""Spirited Away"" make MUCH more sense. But this one is just confusing...and probably will be to Japanese audiences as well.I'm giving the film a 6 simply because the animation was nice and the film was original. But apart from that, the confusing story isn't fun, the characters aren't lovable and I think it's possibly his weakest movie.~planktonrules rated 6/10 on 5 December 2023"
The Grinch (2018) - IMDb,6.4,Benedict Cumberbatch|Cameron Seely|Rashida Jones|Pharrell Williams|Tristan O'Hare|Kenan Thompson|Sam Lavagnino|Ramone Hamilton|Angela Lansbury|Scarlett Estevez|Michael Beattie|Lori Alan|Carlos Alazraqui|Doug Burch|Cathy Cavadini|Tucker Chandler|Townsend Coleman|Meilee Condron,Yarrow Cheney|Scott Mosier,Michael LeSieur|Tommy Swerdlow|Dr. Seuss,A grumpy Grinch plots to ruin Christmas for the village of Whoville.," This film shocked me...it was good...very good.: I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.~planktonrules rated 8/10 on 24 December 2019"," Neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug: Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 6/10 on 20 November 2018"," OK, but feels unnecessary: Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.Bottom line...save your money and rent it later.~brynnharms-70885 rated 4/10 on 10 November 2018"," Excellent!: There is a reason I don't read critic reviews, and it is because I never ever agree with them. Usually when they say a movie is bad, I like it and vice versa. I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film.~AdrienneGrayceMusic rated 10/10 on 11 November 2018"," More or less EXACTLY what one would expect from Illumination's The Grinch.: Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more.~Joshua_Penczek rated 4/10 on 10 November 2018"," Very Colorful: I watched this with my grandson. Yes, I still think the original cartoon based on the book is superior. There is a simplicity that really works. The Grinch is downright mean. I love Benedict Cumberbach, but found his voice just too soothing to pull off our guy. There was too much psychological mumbo jumbo as the writers came up with an excuse for the Grinch being the way he was. Of course, it was his childhood. The movie is spectacular in its visuals. There are colorful scenes and excellent structures, making Whoville really magnificent. But the story is watered down and using Cindy Lou Who as an active character didn't work for me.~Hitchcoc rated 6/10 on 26 June 2019"," Beautiful looking and charming animated feature.: I'm going to keep this review short since you know the story most likely.I was enchanted by this movie from the moment it started. It was a fun animated movie, with gorgeous animation, a lot of heart, and even some humor. The 90 minute run-time makes the movie fly by.And the Grinch is evil but not scary. This has been ridiculed, but I like that the movie was trying to make it more comfortable for the little ones.The ending, even though I knew it was coming, was very uplifting. The Grinch's heart grew 3 times bigger, but guess what? So did mine!This is one of my favorite animated movies now, and my #1 Dr. Suess adaptation. This is the movie to see this holiday season!Note: If you found this review helpful, please click on cinephile-27690 to read my other reviews!~cinephile-27690 rated 10/10 on 11 November 2018"," The Grinch: All Rapped Up: The technicals of this version are outstanding, great, bright animation, very Pixar-ish. However, it fails in its heart which is always driven by actors' voicing and what a BIG FAIL this was - as many others have noted, so you know it's not just a few of us. First, WTH is Pharrell narrating?! Weakest voicing ever! NOTHING even approaching the dramatic storytelling of the classic's Karloff. And his hip-hop, rap interludes were simply wrong for this feature - maybe if you're setting the story in a rundown urban environment, maybe then it'd have fit, but it was totally out of place here. Then Benedict Cucumber-patch's voicing of our main Grinch character was way off base, nowhere up to the task, it was a pathetic reading of the script, the biggest letdown you could imagine. Finally, the naive, demure Cindy Lou Who from the classic is re-imagined as a hyper-active grrl power character which is also annoying and out of place. We can only hope this version is relegated to the dust bin of some Hollywood warehouse, never to be seen again.~TheTruthofItIs rated 3/10 on 13 December 2019"," Don't listen to the grinches reviewing this movie!: Anyone who gave this a bad rating clearly is just upset because, they don't like a modern Grinch because they grew up with the original classic Grinch cartoon. This movie was one of the most adorable and fun feel-good animated movies I've seen in a long time. Benedict Cumberbatch killed it as the Grinch and, all the gadgets and grandeur of the grinches holiday heist scene is so creative and colourful and fantastical! This is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time up there with Nightmare before Christmas. This movie was a joy to watch and if you couldn't find joy in this movie maybe, you're the Grinch.~benribble rated 9/10 on 9 November 2018"," Did they even sing the song?: When the movie ended, I looked over at my family and asked ""did they even sing the grinch song?"" which I was highly anticipating with a fun, new modern edge. my nephew responded with ""it was a remix and not the whole song"" what?! Jim Carey made an entire scene out of it! This movie was a let down. Can they stop remaking movies if they're going to be lazy and unoriginal about it? The Jim Carey one and the original Grinch are way better than this~JosiReviews rated 2/10 on 11 November 2018"

Movie (2023) - IMDb,7.0,Chris Pratt|Anya Taylor-Joy|Charlie Day|Jack Black|Kevin Michael Richardson|Khary Payton|Charles Martinet|Sebastian Maniscalco|Rino Romano|John DiMaggio|Jessica DiCicco|Keegan-Michael Key|Eric Bauza|Fred Armisen|Seth Rogen|Juliet Jelenic|Scott Menville|Carlos Alazraqui,Aaron Horvath|Michael Jelenic|Pierre Leduc,Matthew Fogel,"A plumber named Mario travels through an underground labyrinth with his brother Luigi, trying to save a captured princess."," Illumination's best since Despicable Me 1.: Granted, this film is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers. But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.My theater was PACKED, and probably 75% young children, and they all seemed to have the time of their lives. Your kids will probably love it, and you will probably more than tolerate it.~benjaminskylerhill rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," Solid Example of Game to Screen Adaptation: Video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials, but on their second attempt, the Mario Bros save the day. Being on par with the likes of Sonic and Detective Pikachu, this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a Mario film. Including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise, this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out. With some interesting voice acting choices, no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world. Wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices, I was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come.~Ltufano23 rated 7/10 on 5 September 2023"," pretty much as expected: Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers. When the city's sewer goes haywire, Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame. Instead, they get sucked into an alternate world. The brothers get separated. Mario joins Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser (Jack Black). Luigi gets captured.It's brightly colored. It's energetic. It's got the characters. There's the game play. The story is fairly simple. It's pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it. The brothers could have been that, but they get separated pretty quickly. I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans. It's got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids. It's less so for everybody else.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 19 April 2023"," Everyone is so fixated on rotten tomatoes scores, it really is a solid film.: I am someone who is not swayed by ""critics"" or rotten tomato scores. I didn't even really have any expectations going into this movie. As someone who grew up playing Super Mario Bros, Super Mario World etc., I was really just going to see this movie based on nostalgia and it does deliver on nostalgia. The visuals are stunning, and while everyone has their reservations about Chris Pratt the voice acting is perfect (except one for one elderly character). While many have said this movie moves quickly or ""too fast"", I would say it has great pacing and never leaves you bored. While it is not a perfect film it leaves little to be desired. It is everything you want from an animated Super Mario Movie.~nickryan-44535 rated 8/10 on 5 April 2023", An absolute BLAST!: First off this movie is for kids and fans of Nintendo and the Mario franchise. I still think an adult who isnt a fan could still enjoy it but this movie is so full of fan service that it will have you smiling the whole time. The voice acting I was skeptical but they all work and work well too. Jack Black is the star here. I love how they kept the story simple like all of the games. Truly felt like a video game on screen. This movie felt like a beautifully animated amusement park ride. The audio in the movie was amazing too. The sounds and the score with reimagined iconic music was perfect. Some of the songs in the movie felt unnecessary but they worked. I think they should've bumped the run time to 105-120 min. 90 min felt too short as it goes by quick. I havent had this much wholesome fun at the movies in a long time. If youre a fan you HAVE to see it.~justinvitelli rated 10/10 on 5 April 2023," Critics are being too harsh for what it is: I think for what this movie sets out to do, Super Mario Bros. Movie pretty much ticks the boxes of an entertaining, reference fan-service heavy movie. A lot of the jokes are basic sure, but it's just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie. Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go. Not high art or anything, but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least. Voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought, and Jack Black was the highlight as expected. Yeah, not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is, and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it's one of the best ones easily if you ask me.6.5/10.~AdrenalinDragon rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," The Message Of Love Is Sent Directly To The Fanbase, Not To The General Audience.: This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don't think too much, it's an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.~folk_egm rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023", Chris Pratt was awesome as Mario and Jack black as bowser was remarkable!!!!!!: After meeting Chris Pratt at the Santa Barbara film festival I'm very amazed of how remarkable Chris played Mario for the first. I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game . Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this movie for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now . The Mario movie was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game . Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario . Jack black as bowser was the best for the film. His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding. Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job. He used the characters voice very carefully. The sounds were just like the video game. And i think that was absolutely awesome. The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant. Princess peach was the best part of the movie . She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle . And toad was the best part of the movie . The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome. I hope in the next Mario movie yoshi finds Mario and Luigi and becomes they're pet.~gabethedinosaur rated 10/10 on 6 April 2023," Brilliant animation and portrayal of the super Mario bros!: Took my kids for a special sky screening and boy were we excited! At first I was rather skeptical thinking this film won't do any justice to the games. However, I was wrong! This film met our expectation and beyond. I think I enjoyed this film more than my kids. From the moment the film starts it is enjoyable. Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations. As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood, this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games. A must watch film whether you have kids or not.~mj-80986 rated 10/10 on 5 April 2023"," Just average.: Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.~movies_are_life_ rated 5/10 on 10 April 2023"
Family Switch (2023) - IMDb,5.6,Jennifer Garner|Ed Helms|Emma Myers|Brady Noon|Lincoln Sykes|Theodore Sykes|Rita Moreno|Matthias Schweighöfer|Vanessa Carrasco|Cyrus Arnold|Ilia Isorelýs Paulino|Jordan Leftwich|Xosha Roquemore|Bashir Salahuddin|Paul Scheer|Helen Hong|Ned Bellamy|Andrew Bachelor,McG,Victoria Strouse|Adam Sztykiel|Amy Krouse Rosenthal,"When a chance encounter with an astrological reader causes the Walkers to wake up to a full body switch, can they unite to land a promotion, college interview, record deal, and soccer tryout?"," This Feels Like It Was Written By an AI.: ""Family Switch"" sounds like a temporary title; you'd walk into a meeting room and pitch ""family switch"" and assure the producers you'd come up with something better. But no, the laziness of this film is so astounding, that upon realizing no one had this title before, the filmmakers (and Netflix) decided to just go with it and not really question why.I can't pretend like Family Switch is all that terrible; it crosses into ""so bad it's good territory"", particularly towards the end. The entire ""high school partying"" scene is truly glorious in how bizarre it is. The human interactions feel mechanical and strange, as if the writers had never been around humans before or been to a party. It was this moment when I began to suspect that this movie was in fact, not written by humans, but by an AI. (I'm only half joking)Because everything else feels like an amalgamation of everything you've seen before in every family comedy ever made. What, you're telling me this zany body switch just-so-happens to occur at the time when EVERYONE has this big thing they need to do, with major implications for their future? NO WAY. And, it just so happens that everything just kinda sorta works out in the end? Color me surprised.To be fair, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the performances. Jennifer Garner is pretty good here, probably because she's played this sort of role before. Emma Myers is also quite good as well, and surprisingly, the best out of the bunch. There are also some genuinely funny moments with the two of them, if they aren't a bit juvenile (I don't consider myself too refined for a well time fart joke).But Ed Helms and Brady Noon...what on Earth was going on with these too? I get Helms' character Bill (truly memorable name, I know) is simultaneously the lamest Dad you could imagine, but also impossibly charming and suave? I guess the idea is that in a teenager's body, he could be ""cool"" again, but it's never really communicated properly.Oh, and just to further my AI theory, this film is set at Christmas and is marketed as a ""Christmas movie,"" but I can't consider it one in good conscious. It's a film ""set at Christmas"", but aside from a generic ""appreciate your family"" message, this film has barely anything to do with Christmas. Iron Man 3 is more of a Christmas movie than this one.Still, I do think if you have some time to kill, this movie can be funny to watch in an awkward, cringe inducing sort of way. I guess that's fine.~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 3/10 on 18 December 2023"," So So: I have to admit that I had to watch Family Switch over two viewings. I found it sickly sweet and couldn't cope watching it in one hit. It's the typical oops we have switched bodies but something has to change in the family dynamics before we can be switched back scenario. I can't say that we need 'another' one of these films. If they were hoping it would be some holiday classic, I think they might have somewhat missed the mark.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film, I just didn't love it either.Ed Helms was good in it, and so was Jennifer Garner and even the actors playing their kids. But it just felt like it was missing something, or maybe I am too old and jaded for this kind of film anymore.~destiny_west rated 5/10 on 2 December 2023"," It's not Oscar material, but why would you expect it to be?: This is a cute, feel-good movie that made me laugh out loud a few times and kept me entertained the rest of the time.This falls squarely in the genre of ""Disney-esque"" movies that take place during the holidays, with lots of festive bells jingling and ding-donging throughout the score.I wasn't expecting to raise my IQ by watching it, and of course I didn't. Nor was I expecting a transcendent work of cinematic art, and it wasn't.But the acting was solid from all characters, the premise (while ridiculous, as all of these ""body-swapping"" stories are, unapologetically!) remained pretty steady throughout, and although it was predictable and formulaic, it wasn't over-the-top corny. (Sure, it was a little corny, but not TOO bad.)There's even a cute dance sequence in the middle of the movie that turned suddenly sentimental and made me tear up for no discernable reason except that I am a pathetic sap, lol.I enjoyed it and would recommend it if, like me, you enjoy sometimes just turning your brain off for a bit during the holidays, and watching something that's basically the cinematic equivalent of a warm snowman-shaped sugar cookie.~h2223 rated 7/10 on 3 December 2023"," Swapping Bodies, Losing Laughs: In what can only be described as a cinematic stumble, ""Family Switch"" takes a well-worn plot - the old body swap routine - and manages to make it even more uninspiring. The premise is ripe for hilarity: a nuclear family, the Walkers, get their minds swapped at a planetarium. Sounds fun, right? Not quite. The execution is as dull as a Monday morning algebra class. Jess and Bill, thrust into the lives of teenagers, are reduced to cringe-worthy caricatures of teen angst, while CC and Wyatt, navigating adulthood, seem to have the emotional range of a teaspoon. It's like watching a sitcom that's lost its laugh track.Director McG, known for his kinetic and visually vibrant style, seems to have taken a vacation on this one. The film lacks his usual flair, with scenes playing out in monotonous sequences that feel more like a PowerPoint presentation than a movie. The humor, which should be the film's saving grace, falls flat. There's an attempt at slapstick, but it's so poorly timed it feels like watching a stand-up comedian forget the punchline. And let's not forget the plot holes - they're big enough to drive a truck through. Why does no one outside the family notice these drastic personality changes? The film doesn't seem to care, and neither will you.But the real letdown is the missed opportunity to explore the complexities of family dynamics and generational differences. Instead, ""Family Switch"" opts for surface-level gags and overused tropes. It's a film that feels like it was made on autopilot, with a script that could've used a few more rewrites (or a complete overhaul). In the end, ""Family Switch"" is a forgettable addition to the body-swap genre and a massive departure from the vibrant energy we've come to expect from McG. It's like ordering a sundae and getting a bowl of plain yogurt - disappointing and bland.~natmavila rated 3/10 on 1 December 2023"," White Christmas in Los Angeles: A movie about body switching is not supposed to be realistic and I can accept that. I can accept that the dog switches places with the baby and begins walking on its hind legs, I can accept that the daughter in her mother's body would gorge herself on ice cream for no reason other than flatulence, I can accept that the mother in her daughter's body would pass up an easy chance to win the soccer game to care for another player, I can accept that the boy in his dad's body who can't play a guitar at the beginning of a song is able to shred by the end of the same song (alongside Weezer no less), BUT what I cannot accept is seeing snowfall in Los Angeles like we saw at the end of this movie! The characters pretty much didn't acknowledge it or comment how weird it was. Like at least pretend it's cold outside! It's not like they were in Big Bear, they are supposed to be in LA somewhere. The snow was more far fetched than the whole body switching concept. I was on board with the craziness until the snow started falling.~jdavidson870 rated 5/10 on 1 December 2023"," ""Diving into Today's Movies: Where Storytelling Falls Short, Diversity Feels Forced, and Cinematic Magic Fades"": I was surprised to learn that the film had three separate writers. Although the plot appeared simple, the movie, despite featuring familiar faces, lacked any profound meaning. I typically seek out movies that hold a special place in my heart, like ""Jingle All The Way"" and many others, but contemporary films often fail to evoke that emotional resonance. One scene felt cliché, attempting to be inclusive by featuring every ethnicity and non-binary individual on one couch, potentially diluting its impact.Regarding technical aspects, the cinematography is minimal. While the aerial view of Los Angeles from 3400 feet is visually striking, it doesn't contribute much beyond that. Despite being advertised as a holiday movie, you will notice there isn't much in the film that reiterates this.~vau-51847 rated 3/10 on 2 December 2023"," Worst movie I've seen in ages: I would avoid this cringeworthy movie at all costs. Is this suppose to be a feel good movie? Hey family, let's ruin each other's lives BUT HEY! WE LEARNED TO LOVE EACH OTHER! The dad enters the son's body and completely effs up his college interview for Yale because somehow a grown man acts like an irresponsible teenager while the teenager acts like the adult. Oh and let me blow a huge soccer opportunity for my daughter because I can't kick a ball two more feet before I help the injured girl. Oh and the daughter, I just have to fart in front of my boss because even though I'm a teenage girl, I can't hold my gas like I'm a 6 year old.

What if Freaky Friday was a whole family switching. The result is essentially a youtube cringe compilation. Mom and dad witch with teenage son and daughter. Baby and dog switch. The result? Age jokes that fall flat. Dumb jokes about fashion, lactose intolerance, pop culture references and terrible party movie cliches.Making matters worse. The movie presents a really odd series of stereotypes. As usual the family is wealthy with multiple cars and a classic sports car to destroy filming. They live in what is essentially a mansion. Yet both parents have pretty low end jobs they can just run away from and it's fine? I guess if your life depends on bill payments you can't afford to body switch?The movie is cliche and cringe. Kids want to grow up....but oh it's all too fast. Mom and dad are in a rut. But oh, dating in our teenage children's bodies made us feel young and in love( wtf?). 80s like house party scenes including people engaged in complete choreography shows no one on this cast ever went to a house party. Bad cgi baby and dog remind us those characters should have been cut. The end actually fixed nothing but hey. Group hug.This could have been fun. Simple jokes, physical gags, no cgi. Nice lesson about respect, understanding and sacrifice. Farts, fall down. Crazy work presentations that somehow works. Poop joke. Group hug. Merry Christmas.Is it family Friendly?

I went in with little expectations, because unfortunately Netflix movies are hit and miss. But I liked it. Yes, the switching of bodies has been done a lot, but I thought the writers and actors did a great job of differentiating it from other storylines. It's wholesome and family friendly. There are only so many times you can watch the same family holiday movies. The casting was spot on and the actors seemed like they were having fun. It's definitely one I could watch again.I appreciated that the sister was the jock and brother the nerdy smart guy. It's usually the other way around.~dannonmcelroy rated 8/10 on 4 December 2023"," Jen does another: Jess (Jennifer Garner) and Bill Walker (Ed Helms) are a happily-married suburban couple, but they fear disconnecting from their kids. Daughter CC (Emma Myers) is the star football player. Son Wyatt (Brady Noon) is a science nerd. They with baby brother and dog go to the Griffith Park Planetarium. With a planetary alignment, a telescope, and psychic Angelica (Rita Moreno), the family get switched.This is old hat for Jennifer Garner and the movie refers to her movie as well as others. Ed Helms is playing the music nerd teacher although the back story is leading towards former rock star. That conflict does cause some problems. This is mostly fine but very derivative. Garner can easily switch from stuffy to childish. Ed Helms is a little ill-fitting for the role. For example, Brady Noon is trying to play the dad like a leather jacket rocker in one scene and it doesn't fit his other scenes. The dog baby switch would be funnier if the CGI isn't so Son of the Mask. Of course, there is a dance sequence and I like the premise behind it. As for the band tryout, I don't understand why Wyatt with dad inside doesn't just play the gig. He can claim that dad is injured and the son had been learning from the dad. I do question director McG's style. His brand of humor is very broad and very low hanging fruit. This has a few fine comedic moments but most others are lesser family fun.~SnoopyStyle rated 5/10 on 2 December 2023"

Remember that the beloved one is also a remake. I agree that the former was superior, but like other holiday movies, isn't it fun that we try to update and try things differently? Think about something like ""A Christmas Carol"" which has had numerous incarnations. For me the Alistair Sim version still rests on top, but does that mean we shouldn't have Albert Finney's version or, especially, that of George C. Scott (quite well done). I know that actors and directors interpret things differently. We are in a different world now, and personalities are going to be different. There are still the trials and the usual naysayers and the tools of the government presented in their utter humorlessness. It isn't perfect but it's still worth watching. Also, I enjoyed watching Mara Wilson as the little girl.~Hitchcoc rated 7/10 on 7 January 2017"," Mr. Collins, I hope you've taken down that old TV antenna. I ripped my pants on it last year.: The late Lord Richard Attenborough looked like he enjoyed himself in the role of Santa Claus aka Kris Kringle in this delightful updated remake. With a solid supporting cast, the film included a believable love story between Elizabeth Perkins and Dylan McDermott. Mara Wilson was wonderful as the child. There are other notable performances like Robert Prosky, Allison Janney, Mary McCormack in her first film role, J.T. Walsh and others. The film was shot on location in New York City. Instead of Macy's there is a Cole's Department store and a rival with Jane Leeves. The film has a charm all its own.~Sylviastel rated 8/10 on 13 September 2018"," Sometimes too ""faithful"" to the original, sometimes not enough...: To give the movie its deserved credit, Richard Attenborough is a wonderful successor to the iconic Kris Kingle as played by Edmund Gwenn in George Seaton's seminal Christmas classic ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and Mara Wilson is just as good as the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa but wishes she could and only asks for a proof. In fact, she embodies our very attitude toward the film, we love the original, we want to embrace this one with the same enthusiasm, so we're waiting for the script to charm us.And it's only fair to have high anticipations, the film was made in 1994 when commercialism was as preeminent as five decades later, and written by John Hughes who could give a subtle dimension of satire and benign cynicism, all these elements could have given an edge to the 1994 remake. Unfortunately, the film doesn't really manages to deliver: when it's good, it's just as good as the original, the rest of the time, it's just a pale copy that fails to capture the the taste of its era. This film could have been made in the 80's or the 70's as well because the story is timeless, but not in the 'appealing' meaning of the word.It's incredible but ""Miracle on 34th Street"" manages to feel more dated than its glorious predecessor, the 1947 version starring Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara and young Natalie Wood. Maybe the remake was liable to feel dated because the 1947 classic was already ahead of its time for its take on Christmas consumerism, its portrayal of a divorced mother and a precocious girl (tired tropes today), so any attempt to duplicate the charm of the movie was likely to fail... unless it tried to modernize the original premise a little bit.The problem with Les Mayfield's movie and John Hughes' screenplay is that the two men seem to be in awe with the original and never really dare to make the original structure shatter, not a bit. As a result, we have quite exactly the same movie, and the changes operated in this one never feel as improvements but rather inspire the opposite feeling. For instance, the climactic trial scene with the bags of mail delivered on the courtroom is only replaced by a parallel drawn between the existence of Santa Claus and the faith in God which, as smart as it is, is anticlimactic and leaves many things in wanting.We all know the story is heading toward a heart-warming and magical conclusion but there's just something curiously depressing in the turn of events that lead the gentle Kris Kingle in jail and the way his aura immediately fades while the set-up of his downfall is quite obvious. There was a moment where I expectedKingle to tell that the man he assaulted had just literally accused him of the worst possible crime and had the punch coming, but the scene dangerously flirts with the idiotic plot where the lines that can get you off the hook aren't said, for no other reason that they're waiting for the right moment. I feel a bit guilty to be so judgmental, again there's that snow beard in Richard Attenborough and that glee in his eyes that makes many scenes with him very touching, I loved his interaction with the deaf girl (a smart remake of the Dutch scene), his chemistry with Mara Wilson hit the right chord, and that little girl is a genuinely good actress conveying the right mix of smartness and innocence (a bit like a real-life Lisa Simpson). But the film reminded me of that scene where Kingle and Bryan, the lawyer enamored with Susan's mother, and played by Dylan McDermott, discuss about the mother (Elizabeth Perkins) and say there's something quite sad about her.There's something sad in the film as well, sometimes, Elizabeth Perkins overplay that feeling and make any scene she's in a killjoy, even her romance with Dylan, while integral to the original happy ending, are only inserted in the movie as an 'obligation' but it's obvious these moments slow down the script more than anything. There are a few good characters in the film, the judge played by a scene-stealing Robert Prosky, the so underrated J.T. Walsh as the prosecutor but the film loses its way in many unnecessary plot points, and escalate to a trial where we feel cheated because we didn't have our bags of mail, after all, there was no Internet yet in 1994, it could work.The film is still an enchanting moment that can please any child of any age, but it lacks that little sharpness, the taste of modernity it needed, and luck, too. Macy's didn't want its name associated with the film so they had to come up with a fictional company had to invent a and make the rival an evil businessman, missing the opportunity of the 'marketing policy' subplot that made the first film so ahead of its time. It's like Mayfield and Hughes didn't trust their own material, they had so charming protagonists who could carry the film alone, who needed villains? Especially when the ""system"" or the world's cynicism was good enough an antagonist. A good film nonetheless, but so one-dimensional in its treatment it feels dated by the original film's standards.~ElMaruecan82 rated 6/10 on 1 January 2018"," Miracle on 34th Street (1994): A pretty darn awesome remake. It may bring some extra 90's cheese, mostly due to the needlessly dramatic music, and it may be overlong in places, but this certainly works. Attenborough is the only person I could imagine taking over this role. He comes across as a genuinely kind and considerate man, with nothing but kindness in his heart. Like the original, it keeps silent as to whether he is Santa or not. The court scene is particularly funny, with a few fist pumping moments. I'd still pick the original, but if you can't sit your whole family down in front of a black and white film, this certainly doesn't offend the original.~SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain rated 7/10 on 14 December 2011"," I adore this movie: I watch it every year. I've read negative reviews of Mara Wilson's performance but I think she is charming and smart but not at all obnoxious or know-it-all as others have said. She is acting over maturely as she was raised by her no-nonsense and jaded mother. Her subtle winks and expressions are very apropos to her role and she interacts very well with Mr. Kringle. (Perhaps I like her because she looks like my daughter when she was little.) Regardless, I love the way this story is told and Mara makes it for me. Even though logically she was taught that Santa was not real, as a little girl she was still willing to believe. Take a little joy in believing! I hope you enjoy :)~pegaroo2-235-917453 rated 10/10 on 14 December 2012"," 51 year old guy bawls his eyes out, as usual: I can't see why a retelling of a really good story gets panned. It stayed true to the original concept, that believing in something good, even if it only comes once a year, can make us better. If I may reference another Christmas classic of which there have been several worthy interpretations, ""Scrooge"" (1951), the young Scrooge says to the young Marley upon their meeting, ""I believe the world is becoming a very hard and cruel place..."". If it was that way in the 1800's, it's ten times worse today, and therefore all the more reason to be reminded of our better nature. I especially enjoyed the scene where the streets of New York City were filled with throngs of people, traffic on the bridges was stopped, all waiting for the verdict. I know NYC well, and how its people rise to such occasions. These scenes were not in the 1947 version, and I think they added a uniqueness to this version. Better, worse than the 1947 version? Neither - just different, and just as valid.~ProudSonOfNewJersey rated 8/10 on 19 May 2005"," Lovely remake of the incomparable 40's classic, another gift from John Hughes to the world: Dorey (Elizabeth Perkins) and her daughter, Susan (Mara Wilson) live in New York City, where Dorey works for a long-established department store called Coles. It's Thanksgiving Day and Dorey is in charge of the Coles' parade through Manhattan. Naturally, things don't go as planned when the Santa she hired turns up tipsy and belligerent. But, very fortunately, a kind, white-bearded gentleman, Kris (Sir David Attenborough) is in the right place at the right time. He saves the day with his wonderful parade presence and Dorey hires him to be in the in-store Santa from that day forward. Going home to Susan, the two gals have a handsome dinner guest, lawyer-neighbor Bryan (Dylan McDermott) to share their turkey and trimmings. Bryan is in love with Dorey but, she is very reluctant to encourage his affections for she was jilted long ago and left with the sole responsibility for Susan. A nearby department discount chain, Shopper's Express, is mighty peeved at Coles' new Santa, for he begins to turn things around for the ailing Coles. Sabotaging his performance, they get dear Kris sent to jail on various charges. Dorey begs Bryan to represent Kris in a trial that will decide if he is, truly, Santa Claus. But, can Bryan succeed at winning Kris' freedom and stature as well as securing Dorey's heart? We'll see! The old classic, with Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara, is still the definite version of this tale but this one comes awfully close in charming its viewing audience. First, the cast is marvelous, with Perkins, McDermott, Attenborough and darling little Wilson giving very nice performances. The supporting cast, including J.T. Walsh, is also wonderful. Then, director and writer Hughes has added some nice touches and modern situations to the timeless tale, making it feel ""more up-to-date"". All of the production values, from costumes to sets to camera work, are of the finest. In short, don't shy away from this new version, even if you love the original. Both of them are magical in their own unique ways. March up your street and get this one for the holidays, or, indeed, any time you need a shot of that warm, happy feeling.~inkblot11 rated 9/10 on 27 November 2009"," great Richard Attenborough but not a good reason to remake: Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins) is the producer of the Christmas parade for Cole's department store. Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough) is shocked at the drunken Santa in the parade. Dorey quickly puts Kris Kringle in to replace the drunk. Her daughter Susan (Mara Wilson) doesn't believe in Santa because her mother explained it all to her. Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott) is Dorey's boyfriend. Dorey hires Kris Kringle as the store's Santa who becomes popular for recommending shoppers to other stores. Susan is taken with the new Santa and starts to believe that he's the real deal. There is a rival store Shopper's Express which tries to sabotage Kris Kringle by getting him arrested.There is the great Richard Attenborough and a cute little girl. There is nothing wrong with the acting. The script is a little dated. Some of the simpler elements seem charming in the original but seem naive in the modern version. This one has very little to offer other than Attenborough. Also for some reason, they got rid of the post office plot line. The mailbags piled into the courtroom is probably the most compelling scene in the original.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 12 December 2014"," Makes me realize how brilliantly the original was structured - here's why ...: This remake of the 1947 classic shows how beautifully constructed George Seaton's original script was, because every change John Hughes made from that script weakens the film. For example...In the original, Kris hits someone with the cane who has been psychologically harming his genial friend. Violent, but sympathetic. In the remake, he attacks someone for mocking him. Uncool. It makes me sympathetic to the idea that he might be dangerous.This makes the ""we believe"" hysteria unconvincing. There's no good reason after that for him to become even more popular with the public. And the store execs coming out in support of him ... well, I wouldn't.His reasons for flunking his psychological test also make no sense (I've forgotten what they were, I just remember it was dumb).The courtroom scenes are a disaster. Replacing the DA's kid with his wife weakens the scene - what was the point?. The suggestion of improper influence on the judge is a throwaway that doesn't fit anywhere. The judge staring at that dollar bill for a minute and then coming up with the exact legal argument Kris' lawyer wants him to have is just absurd, and the speech itself is awful. And while the original divided the courtroom sequence into two parts, first forcing the judge to rule there is a Santa (based on political and personal concerns removed from the remake) and only then, with the insanely brilliant mail scene, giving him an out to rule for Kris, the remake simply has the judge basically say, ""well, if there's a Santa Claus I guess, sure, it's this guy.""Then there's the final scene. In the original, they are using instructions from Kris that lead them to THE house. In this one they *know* they're going to a house (unclear on why) and the girl keeps shouting it's her house (it's as though Hughes believed everyone knows how it would end so why attempt a surprise) and then there's someone at the house with keys who prattles on and it's all just messy and anticlimactic and so, so inelegant.Even the most reasonable change - making the antagonist a scheming outsider - ultimately undercuts the theme. The original was about faith, and the mix and hostility, skepticism, and belief within Macy's represented that. By making Kris' downfall an external plot, you lose that. It's a small thematic weakness, but the point is, it's a change, and the movie is worse because of it.Everything is dumber, everything is less convincing, everything is less resonant.NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY ... here's my reviewThis remake is a dumber, less engaging take on the old movie with a few high points and way too many low points. Richard Attenborough is excellent as the charming and philosophical Kris, and Elizabeth Perkins is every bit as good as Maureen O'Hara. The scene where she rejects the proposal is actually really intense, with Perkins beautifully displaying angry lashing out built from intense fear. It's a scene that deserves to be in a better (and very different) movie.Dylan McDermott, on the other hand, brings to mind a statue brought to life, distractingly perfect and running the emotional gambit, as the old joke goes, from A to B. As for Mara Wilson, her performance is an interesting alternative to Natalie Wood's, less steely and intellectual and a little more human and cutesy, and while I prefer Wood I wouldn't say one was necessarily better than the other.I'm of two minds about how watching the original effects my take on this one. On the one hand, perhaps I'm being too harsh because the original was so good. On the other hand, if I'd never seen the original this one would probably make even less sense and I would wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to make such a stupid movie.Not unredeemably terrible, but not recommended.~cherold rated 6/10 on 28 December 2021"," Do you believe? If so, why?: Richard Attenborough returned to acting after 14 years behind the camera in ""Jurassic Park"", and followed it swiftly by daring to challenge comparison with Oscar-winner Edmund Gwenn in this remake. As a heartwarmer for those inadequates who won't sit through a 60-year-old monochrome movie-- albeit one which rivals ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as Hollywood's answer to ""A Christmas Carol""-- this John Hughes revamp will probably serve. Anyhow, there are plenty of copies on sale at the checkout of my local supermarket. But it is a bit too laid-back and, latterly, too bogged down in argument for younger kids or older boys. It may warm more cockles among the grandparents.The main thematic interest is how Hughes chooses to tweak the original screen story as adapted (unusually for the time) by the director, George Seaton. Whether he sought to or not, the remake has thrown up some intriguing twists for a more skeptical and secular time.The oldie caught the mood of an America yearning to get back to normalcy amid the perils of the post-war, Cold War world. Location shooting in New York City, with much co-operation from Macys, gave a touch of realism to the fantasy, whereas in 1994 it's an imaginary store and (for Americans, at least) an incongruously ""veddy British"" claimant to the chair of Santa Claus- although his nationality is not the issue when the legal meanies of the State of New York try to get him confined to the bughouse.What is striking is the judge's rationale for allowing Kris's plea for freedom. Because US bills have ""In God We Trust"" on them, he reasons, it means New York is allowed to have blind faith in the existence of a supernatural being who lays presents on 1.7 billion children in one night, operating from invisible workshops with reindeer which cannot be made to fly in a courtroom demonstration of his powers because it isn't Christmas Eve. Besides, the sneery prosecutor's kids were raised to believe in him, so there- case closed.In real life the ACLU would be appealing such a judgement all the way to the Supreme Court for allowing too much religion into the law and the public square. ""In God We Trust"" was only put on the money during the Cold War, to cock a snook at ""Godless bolshevism""; but this film is refreshingly disrespectful to the newer orthodoxy of playing down most Americans' beliefs in their films.Kris asks if he should swear in the Bible, the Pope's ruling on Nicholas's sanctity is debated, and the ethos is quietly but unmistakably Christian. No ""spiritual"" Santa or ""Happy Holidays"" here. In a very light fashion, the film does revolve issues of how far it is legitimate to maintain a metaphor as a source of inspiration when rationalism of the Dawkins and Hitchens strain is sniping at it. The screenplay also looks quite beadily at the way commercial operators use holy myth to make money, even if the message comes muted from Hollywood.That is the good news. There's plenty to carp at as well.Attenborough's quiet, gentle but firm performance (most atypical of one who spent his previous acting time mainly playing unreliables or martinets) suffuses the film. He gets little competition, save from the contrasted crustiness of Windom. Most of the support is so-so, on the level of a Yuletide TV special, and not excluding little Wilson as the girl who has faith in Mr Kringle's claim to be St Nicholas. She is no Margaret O'Brien, if no worse in her way than the kewpie-doll Natalie Wood. In fact, she's a John Hughes moppet who did little later and nothing since 2000.The narrative's departures from the well shaped original are no help. Once off the legal hook, Kris, wearing a brown suit, just disappears-- we don't see any triumphal sleigh ride to bid him adieu-- while attention shifts to a ridiculous post-midnight-mass impromptu wedding in a Catholic church. Then follows a trip out to a dream house in the snowy country, ushered by a silly salesman. The film does not seem to know when to call a halt, and there's not so much as Clarence's tinkling bell to bring back Kris at the close. It's as if the whole object of the exercise was to unite two bland characters in matrimony.~Oct rated NA on 23 December 2007"

Excitement. And then: enthusiasm. The cinema went with it. Laughed, could hardly sit still. As an adult, you have to get involved with the candy backdrop of the marshmallow world, like in the two previous films, as well as the boy band music, which of course isn't for everyone.If you get involved with it, you'll be really entertained. A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film. There will probably be few judgments in between. But children will be thrilled.~MarcusCyron rated 8/10 on 15 October 2023"," Loved It!: I personally really enjoyed the movie the whole way through. It's truly amazing to watch these characters grow and develop, the soundtrack is catchy, the cast is incredible, the voice acting, too!The movie captures Branch's trauma in a special way and I really love that. They manage to make it real but in a kid-friendly way.I've been a fan of the franchise since the first movie, so getting to see how these characters became who they are and getting to see their backstories was really satisfying.Branch and Poppy's relationship really stuck out to me. I love how Poppy dealt with Branch's feelings and made sure he knew his feelings were valid.Very very well done dreamworks threequel and I can't wait to see where they take this franchise next.10/10.~evangelinebone rated 10/10 on 7 November 2023"," New Characters, Old Friends: Well as a 49-year old woman(giving out my age lol!!), who is a kid at heart with these movies here.

I applaud the writers firstmost for this achievement.

The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. Trolls Band Together had me out of my seat, dancing and singing along to all the songs.In the film, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple. As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boy band ""BroZone,"" with his four brothers. BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch has not seen his brothers since. When Branch's bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of pop-star villains, Velvet (Amy Schumer) and Veneer (Andrew Rannells), Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity.Trolls Band Together embraces the boy band era with so many references to everyone's favorite bands. The movie delivers a lot of heart, along with showing the importance of family values, friendship, and love. The entire movie is filled with humor, catchy cover songs, amazing animation, and lessons about family. Directed by Walt Dohm and Tim Heitz, the animation in this DreamWorks production is stunning -- all the vibrant colors throughout the movie are amazing. I was not able to take your eyes off the screen. All the music goes so well with the storyline in every scene. It features a new original song, ""Better Place,"" from Justin Timberlake's old boy band NSYNC. It was so fun to sing and dance along. The voice actors are terrific. Timberlake and Kendrick are joined by Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Icona Pop, Anderson Paak, Ron Funches, Kenan Thompson, Kunal Nayyar plus a handful of newcomers. They could not have picked a better group of actors to voice these characters. The script by Elizabeth Tippet is so smart, but my favorite part is all the songs and dances throughout the movie. Trolls movies have been a hit with viewers of all ages and this one is no different. I predict that everyone will be singing and dancing and loving every minute of this movie.The film's message is about family dynamics and how all family relationships are different. It shows viewers that no two families are the same and all families have their differences with each other, but they are still family. Be aware that it contains some rude and suggestive humor and some scary creatures like the Bergens and large spiders, plus the trolls are chased and eaten.I give Trolls Band Together 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults. You can watch Trolls Band Together in theaters on November 17, 2023.

After that, the music is almost non-stop.TIPS FOR PARENTS:Parents will appreciate the music, clever jokes, and well-presented values.A character asks someone if she's a ""Narc"". Kids probably won't know what that means.Because the movie was designed for kids, there are a lot of scenes that feature underwear.To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!~trinaboice rated 8/10 on 31 October 2023"

When Smeerensburg's new postman, Jesper, befriends toymaker Klaus, their gifts melt an age-old feud and deliver a sleigh full of holiday traditions."," In a sea of generic Christmas movies, Klaus stands out: Klaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.~cricketbat rated 8/10 on 22 December 2019"," My Christmas watchlist just got a little longer: Everything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired. JK SImmons as the title character, the animation style, the way in which the various elements of the mythos come together organically and so forth all just fit. Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.I will be watching this each year for awhile.~CubsandCulture rated 10/10 on 9 December 2019"," Claus.: Whilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.~morrison-dylan-fan rated 10/10 on 28 December 2020"," Wow, we finally have a new Christmas classic: Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.Of course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say ""Ho! Ho! Ho!?"". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10~Joejoesan rated 9/10 on 14 November 2019"," Never thought I'd give a ""sappy"" cartoon a 10, but what a surprise: Sure, sappiness is cute, and fun to indulge in. I thought I'd seen it all. But what sappiness was in the movie well used. The main thrust was not sappy. It was a well told story, with the proper nuances in the animation and the vocalization. I consider this movie to be for adults. You will thoroughly enjoy it.~andymhancock rated 10/10 on 16 November 2019"," I am not crying, you are crying.: I haven't felt this good after watching a movie. I feel good about myself. I am not kidding, I actually cried during and after the credit rolled. Thank you Netflix.~kaleem_091983 rated 10/10 on 25 November 2019"," KLAUS: The Netflix Classic for Christmas.: I typically wouldn't mention a movie as a classic except for the two first films of Shrek. But Klaus it's amazing.Allow me to explain myself.There are so many reasons why Klaus remains as a classic.FIRST of all and the most visible one:THE ANIMATION. I'm not an animator but I love animation so I can tell when something is beautifully animated. Klaus isn't animated by computer, is hand-drawn animation which involves so much more work and it's worthy at the end because the result is so delightful. The colors, the details, the characters, the locations and every particular aspect are properly drawn, so you feel so good watching it.SECOND: You need more than looks to produce a classic and this film has a pretty good STORY. The plot is simple, a post man is sent to the unhappiest place in the world to deliver 6,000 letters, but in this place nobody delivers letters. Simple, the way that this plot seeks his way to include the origin story of Santa Claus it's amazing. Every twist is graceful and the ending is satisfactory.THIRD: animation and story are reached because of THE CHARACTERS: Every single and unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily.From beginning to end, the film is perfection for the Christmas holiday.~edicionccq rated 10/10 on 23 November 2019"," Anti-Postmodern Santa Claus: If postmodernism is defined as a rejection of morality and human nature, then this animated story is a repudiation of that rejection, but done in a refreshingly adult and not too overly sentimental way.Thankfully, there are none of the usual Hollywood tropes; rather, the characters and situation are very grounded despite having elements of the fantastical and surrealism mixed in. It is not even Disney-esque, which is also a very good good thing.That this ""Santa Claus"" is not the only main character is moreover a good choice by the writers. By doing so, the story is able to focus on how a mythical character could conceivably come to be - and that makes for a very interesting and entertaining premise.Everything about this animated story is well done: The animation is crisp and detailed; the dialogues are convincing and at times humorous; the music fits, is modern, and used judiciously.Young children will not probably understand the deeper meanings, but everyone else will.~keikoyoshikawa rated 9/10 on 17 November 2019"," Watch and learn, Disney: Very solid original story, awesome visual style and great writing. All it takes. On the contrary, reinventing 30 year old cartoons and doubling down on puritan stuff does not help.This film deserves broader recognition - best Christmas catroon in a long long time~tarapov-92-654064 rated 8/10 on 17 November 2019"," Haven't cried after watching an animated movie in so long.: One of the sweetest, emotional and best Animated film of the year.

Thompson,Phil Lord|Christopher Miller|Dave Callaham,"Miles Morales catapults across the multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero."," One Step Above Masterpiece!: It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.~MiroslavKyuranov rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," Masterful IMAX Spider-Man: The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," One of the best sequels to anything ever made: If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.~pugpool10 rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," A new Empire Strikes Back: This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.~rickothan rated 10/10 on 2 June 2023"," Okay This Is Peak: First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.~hectorvernet rated 10/10 on 31 May 2023"," My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.~cricketbat rated 7/10 on 1 June 2023"," It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5): Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.~nickryan-44535 rated 7/10 on 6 June 2023"," My movie of 2023 so far.: It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 11 June 2023"," This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.: I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.~DeadMansTrousers rated 6/10 on 14 June 2023"," Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it: I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 11 June 2023"

But here he also sings and dances and does both quite well.My favorite song in this production is, Good Afternoon! This is an entertaining and funny bit as well as a running gag throughput the remainder of the movie which makes it all the more enjoyable.Are there better movie versions of A Christmas Carol? Yes. Of course.I love Disney's A Christmas Carol, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Scrooge, and Scrooged.Are there better movie musicals? Absolutely.La La Land. Moulin Rouge for starters.But this is a nice, comedic Christmas musical very much in the holiday spirit and should be experienced as such.And it should be seen and heard in the theater.Maybe go to a matinee. Good Afternoon!~RightOnDaddio rated 8/10 on 23 November 2022"," Not what expected - but better!: I'm honestly not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. It took me a little bit to get into it as I thought it was just going to be another so-so remake of the overdone ""Christmas Carol."" When I learned that it was a semi-musical, I was slightly less enthused as I am not a big fan of musicals. In the end, it was just what I needed. It might be just what a lot of people need. It was funny, witty, charming and uplifting with just a touch of adult humor here and there. It is also something that has a relevant message for kids and teens. There were certainly some plot twists that set it apart from the normal run of the mill remake. In the end, it was a great watch. In fact, I might even watch it again.~Kkiff-640-46856 rated 10/10 on 19 November 2022"," Wonderful. Marvelous. Life affirming.: This was great fun.It is over the top, corny, sickly sweet and full of niceness.My take is that the musical pieces are over the top on purpose - as alluded to by several characters. It is meant to be cheesy. Its meant to be self aware and mocking the genre.There are references to lots of other movies and musicals all over the place, but if I had to classify it I'd say its part traditional scrooge, part scrooged (the Bill Murray movie) and part greatest showman (so much so I was expecting Jackman to make an appearance).Its very meta in places. Its self referential.The songs are funny and over the top.The three leads are fantastic.The whole thing is played with much gusto.And this is coming from someone who loathes musicals.Its also very funny. Ferrell was born to play the role he is playing here. Reynolds is close to the type of character he is known best for - but it works well (thats not a criticism - I think he is very well cast). Spencer is perfect - bringing some heart to proceedings.Don't take it too seriously - its fun.~sjo-15 rated 10/10 on 21 November 2022"," If you like Christmas and musicals, you'll love this: There isn't much deep things to say about this movie. It's a new spin on The Christmas Carol, it's a comedy musical and it's incredibly enjoyable.In my opinion it starts a bit boring but then it really picked up when the story actually started to happen. It brings something original to the iconic Christmas Carol, it's funny and the songs are catchy and fun.If you're looking to watch something Christmasy and you like musicals this is a must watch. Absolute delight for a family, even though I'm single and I watched it alone in my couch while eating crisps lol.My only negative opinion is that the humour can be a bit cringy sometimes but that's okay, it made me laugh too! 8/10, I'd definitely recommend. Well maybe not if you don't like musicals and people bursting into songs or Christmas.~sarahilayda1 rated 8/10 on 23 November 2022"," Rated high out of pure enjoyment: Not perfect but highly entertaining - I could watch Ryan and Will banter all day. Background dancers were amazing and the singing from the leads was decent, particularly Octavia and Ryan. Will struggled with the singing the most and had the most solos but it was easy to give him a pass because he embraces his character so well. The singing is still less annoying than the live singing in Cats. This doesn't have the memorable music of The Greatest Showman but the first big number will stick in your head. Definitely a feel good Christmas movie with an original take on the classic story.Music C+Dancing A+Sets A+Story B+~girl4film rated 9/10 on 18 November 2022"," Got to see this as Monday mystery movie even with a couple hours sleep it was a pleasantly joyful film!: Not sure why they didn't allow reviews till today but I'm delighted to be one of the first. I'll put it out though musicals are my least favorite genre and Spirited is one of the best ones I've seen; I usually can't stand the sudden singing in most cases yet this was so much fun and the story was spectacular fun! This was even better in RPX I was surprised how packed the audience I guess people like the mystery movies they are defiantly worth it. Sean Anders comedies are always great entertainment, the humor is spot on, cast is magnificent, and the special effects are impressive. Spirited was a great way to celebrate Christmas early I highly recommend it.~UniqueParticle rated 9/10 on 11 November 2022"," Goofy, chaotic, musical fun: THINGS I LIKED:Who doesn't adore Ryan Reynolds? (Those who don't like the same character he plays in almost every role he does.) Well, now we know he can sing too! This is his first musical ever.I know some people don't like Will Ferrell, but I get a kick out of him most of the time. What I love about him is that he doesn't seem to take himself seriously and is up for any gag, joke, or physical humor.Both Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell were each paid $20 MILLION dollars for being in this movie! The total amount spent on the cast alone was $75 MILLION!This is the second adaptation of A Christmas Carol that Patrick Page has been in.You'll get a kick out of the celebrity cameos.This cute musical explains that the afterlife is a musical. Yay! I knew it! 😊There's a funny shout-out to Judy Dench and her age. She's such a national treasure.There are a couple of sweet twists.Fun, energetic choreography. The fantastic tap dancing was a fun bonus.The movie isn't a traditional Christmas movie, but because it features elements from A Christmas Carol and some holiday décor, it makes a fun addition to the movies that come out in November to get us in the mood for the most magical time of the year!In between the bouncy musical numbers, there is some social commentary we should consider about the priorities in our own lives.Keep watching during the final rolling credits for a musical reprise.The ultimate test of a movie might be if you'd watch it again. For me, it's a yes. Some of the jokes fly fast and furiously, especially the lyrics in the songs, so I'm sure I missed some fun content.This is the kind of Christmas show that'll put a goofy grin on your face. We need more of those.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:I get a kick out of Will Ferrell, but readily admit his singing isn't the greatest. That being said, none of the leading singers were very good, but still plenty better than how I can sing.Not all of the humor lands.We don't need all of the crude humor. Making jokes palatable for adults who watch this with their kids doesn't mean the humor has to be vulgar.TIPS FOR PARENTS:Some profanitySome crude jokesWe see a naked Will Ferrell in the shower from the waist upWill Ferrell flips the birdTHEMES:Can people change?RedemptionRipples of our kindnessYour choices make you who you are.Do a little goodThe afterlifePrioritiesPast, present, futureChoices and consequences.You can see the full review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.~trinaboice rated 9/10 on 12 November 2022"," Ignore the Naysayers: Seriously...people have given this movie low ratings because they just don't like musicals (then don't watch it). Or it's too long (it's not). Or they failed to research the movie and thought it would be family appropriate (it's really not).I have it a perfect rating because this movie is funny, witty, and a nice fresh take on a worn-out story. The whole concept of a 'behind-the-scenes' look at 'A Christmas Carol' is brilliant.Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds are hysterical as they play off of each other...Reynolds plays up the 'I am awful, I know it, and I am not doing what you say' to Ferrell's 'you will be redeemed if it's the last thing I do' attitude perfectly.And yes, there is singing. And dancing...oh so much dancing. Because it's a MUSICAL. The songs are funny and the dancers are awesome.And don't forget the gem that is Octavia Spencer. I was so happy to see her in this film.Give this movie a chance. You won't regret it.~danekera-97717 rated 10/10 on 23 December 2022"," Good afternoon, from someone who isn't a fan of musicals.: I don't like Christmas movies, I don't like musicals, and guess what was the Monday mystery movie... yup, a Christmas musical. So clearly I'm not the target audience, but I try to watch everything so here we are. So many people walked out as this was the Monday mystery movie, it was actually disrespectful. I saw a leak post earlier saying it was going to be spirited so I was a little mentally prepared and actually tried to enjoy it.Pretty upbeat just like any other Christmas movie. It starts out as a kid's movie, guess most musicals are, but still has some 'dirty' jokes as it goes on. Runtime's way longer than the actual plot was due to the singing. It got a couple good laughs; at times felt more of a comedy than musical. A good blend of Reynolds and Farrells humor, if you're a fan of either you might enjoy it.Actually could have been more bearable for me if it wasn't a musical, every time I was about to forget it is someone started singing; after a while there's longer periods between the songs, and other moments when songs are squeezed together, mostly at the beginning of the movie and at the end. So there actually wasn't as much singing, you almost forget it's a musical in the middle.I think the camerawork and production set felt like it was set up on stage so it felt like a theatre play. Songs aren't as catchy, I only recall if two that had me.The story is pretty predictable on how it's going to end, it's just the journey of getting there. My favorite parts were when the singing was abruptly cut, singing aside its a decent movie. I just want to say you don't have to make a Christmas movie every year, it's almost impressive how they keep churning them out. I don't think this is a terrible addition, but Love, Actually is still the only Christmas movie I actually love.~AfricanBro rated 6/10 on 17 November 2022"
