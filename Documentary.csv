Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023) - IMDb,6.7,B.A. Aloor|C.S. Chandrika|Nikhila Henry|Remo Roy|K.G. Simon|Megna Srivastav|Rojo Thomas|Renji Wilson,Christo Tomy,,"The real life case of Jolly Joseph, a lady suspected of planning the cyanide poisoning of six family members over more than ten years, including a two-year-old kid."," Way more interesting for those who know little about the case! [+65%]: If you're familiar with Asiaville's 2020 Spotify podcast Death, Lies & Cyanide, or if you're from Kerala (or lived there in the past few years at least), you'd already know the entire chronology of events in this case. Of course, the most striking element here is that a woman allegedly committed these heinous crimes. The podcast I mentioned has a subtle horror undertone to it (backed by a superb score and a terrific narration), whereas Christo Tomy's Netflix documentary plays out more like a mystery thriller.The reenactments are neatly done, and the interviews give us added insight from the family's perspective, especially from an emotional angle. The editing pattern is reminiscent of what we've seen in several Netflix productions (of this kind) in recent times, replete with jumpcuts, family-tree diagrams, and a non-linear style of presentation. It would've been interesting (although not practical) to hear from Jolly herself, but since the trials are ongoing and will probably take years to conclude, I understand why Netflix went the route it did.~arungeorge13 rated 7/10 on 22 December 2023"," Interesting, disturbing but maybe a bit imbalanced?: I want to preface this review that I absolutely believe she's done it. Given the evidence and timeline there is almost no doubt that she's guilty.And it's a really nicely made true crime film. The timeline is well worked out. Her life and motives are clearly known, and the family members clearly want the full story told. And it's frequently awful to watch. Just normal ignorance, lack of oversight and questional methods by coroners allowed her to continue.Again I think she did it. But I felt a little uncomfortable that the only 'other side of the story', was some hack lawyer? Perhaps everyone who knows her turned on her. Fair enough. But the counter argument could have been narrated or at least laid out for balance. She hasn't been convicted yet, and even tho she seems completely guilty, it's til proven innocent, so it seems a bit of a hit piece. It kind of takes away from it's integrity.~souplahoopla rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," Gripping Documentary: I remember hearing lots of news reports and self-made theories related to this case from media houses a few years back. I never knew all the details of this case, and we tend to forget all the elements, including the chronology of events, after a few years. This documentary does well in collating all the details and I did enjoy this doc from Netflix.I won't say this is a bad documentary but still, there were questions left unanswered and I think the creators could have included all this and could have made it a comprehensive one. I am not going into spoilers. Just give the documentary a watch and you will get it.~appusnikhil rated 8/10 on 25 December 2023"," Should have been more well researched: An engrossing documentary that moves so fast that it forgets that it's a documentary. Usually, when I watch a documentary, even when it's based on a well-known event, there would be a lot more research that goes into it which shows a lot more information than what the media would've told till then. Here, that is not the case. There's little to nothing in the way of new information that I wasn't aware of before. Moreover, good documentaries would delve into more faults from the side of the police or those which happened at different points of investigation which seemed to have happened a lot in this case but is not focused. The whole focus was on telling the story from a fixed perspective in a thrilling manner. Even though, Aloor is shown as someone who speaks for Jolly, it is not nearly as convincing as it is designed to be. Which itself is not an issue, but when there's so much more that happened around it that is conveniently skipped, which feels almost like it is because it was never covered by the mainstream media. There are so many questions I'm left with at the end, that the overuse of some cinematic techniques makes me feel this wasn't as good as I felt when I watched it.The way Jolly has given some of her statements, and the way her own son talks about her, it is pretty clear she is the culprit even without more solid evidence. But the lack of more solid evidence and the lack of focus on different angles on why that happened is very apparent here.Overall as a documentary, this feels like an average affair because it is a cinematic retelling of a known story without any research into new information.~Jithindurden rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023) - A Chilling Revelation: Having known about the unsettling case of Jolly Joseph's cunning serial killings,Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case' (2023) managed to present the story in a raw and gripping manner. The unique storytelling approach made the narrative truly stand out. It's important to note that this case is ongoing and still in the trial process, which sets limitations on a complete personal postmortem from Jolly's perspective. Nonetheless, this documentary provided a satisfying and spine-chilling storytelling experience. The director and the team deserve applause for crafting a haunting yet captivating portrayal of this ongoing and impactful story.~toashiqmajeed rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," Dangerous....: Let me thank Netflix first as I came across this beautiful, gripping and capturing scenes so vividly. Though there has been several adaptations in the form podcasts and TV serials but I found this documentary superbly made.The narration, correct sequences and chronology of events were well adapted. The flow of the documentary was well placed where it gave sufficient time to audience to understand what was happening. The interviews of the family did make me feel the pain they were going through and how they were coping in last 20yrs.The sound and music I felt was appropriate and well moderated, it further made the documentary more gripping. The direction and the script was very good and made me eager and glued to my seat to follow the chronology so that I don't miss any critical situations.It is stumbling to see that people in the world has criminal mind and are able to hide it, but one fine day such heinous crimes are revealed.~sanghani rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"," First Indian true crime documentary I've seen: The crimes described in this documentary are horrible and despicable. I am very sorry for the sons who have lost so many loved ones, and, in a way, have also lost their mother.It was very interesting to watch for me because I've never seen a true crime documentary from India. As a European, I think you can learn quite a bit through this docu beyond the actual topic. For example, I didn't know there are so many Christians in Kerala and I found it interesting to learn about the dominant gender roles that kind of protected Jolly from suspicion for so long. That made this docu much more interesting than watching yet another true crime docu about an american or European case.Also: Great respect to the aunt who pushed for a police investigation. She seems to be a truly just person.~felixfrey-50190 rated 9/10 on 25 December 2023"," murder is the...: Same whenever it happens and how it takes place anywhere in the world, cause they have the same link, somebody have died at the hands of someone other than ''god''.True life crime murder documentaries though who presents to us viewers every little nook and cranny of the despicable deeds, may vary from a scale of -10 to +10, ive seen loads of garbage american tlc that base all their presentations on reenactments and dramatization to a degree that people miss the atrocyties of the killings.This documentary also use the reenactment method, so howcome it is that it comes on top of the grumpy old mans scale? Well its because it tells the story thoroughly locked tightly to the timeline, as well as interviewvs with police, media and family, using media clippings , both pictorial and audio, and uses the cameralense showing the crowded society of kerala,india, its nature in such a manner that you feel like being at home or at least familiar to it.Its still an ongoing case in the judicial system of india, no conviction has been dealt yet, so i hope for a follow up documentary on this cyanide case. And my tip to the producers is to put in some live court recordings and filmed police interrogations next to it, then youll risk getting a 12 stars from the grumpy old manbravo!!~ops-52535 rated 10/10 on 23 December 2023"," Bone-chilling doc: Curry & Cyanide is an absolutely gripping and disturbing documentary about the Koodathayi Cyanide killing case and includes viewpoints from many individuals involved with the events. Kudos to the sister who pursued the case relentlessly to ""speak for the dead"" even under intense public scorn. The creators of the series meticulously compiled the data and and superbly articulated the gruesome story related to this case. This is a psychopath story that may make you lose faith in humanity at times and will definitely leave you feeling unwell in the end. Netflix does a good job releasing these true crime documentaries.~eggheader rated 7/10 on 26 December 2023"," Soulless monster: It is vastly disturbing that not only was she getting the cyanide on the pretense of poisoning a poor stray dog (what type of monster harms an innocent animal?????!!!!!), but that she killed a 2-year-old child.We have seen documentaries on serial killers and similar before - this is nothing new. Her motives not only shone a light on the apathetic monster she was but the meticulous way she constructed the ""reality"" around her to work in her favor.My heart breaks when I hear news of animal and/or child abusers/killers. They are the most vulnerable in our society and we are not doing enough to protect either.~Shiryu05 rated 7/10 on 28 December 2023"
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023) - IMDb,6.1,Nadine Louise Guerrara|Steve Cartisano|Chris Smith|Lance 'Horsehair' Jaggar|Kinney Drellich Edlinger|Matthew Callahan|Kari Callahan|Debbie Cartisano|Max Jackson|Kristen Chase|Sharon Fuqua|David Chase|Charles Brofman|Adam Weinberg|Larry Weinberg|Ashley Baldwin|Catie Cartisano|David Cartisano,Liza Williams,,"Out-of-control teens across America were sent to a therapy camp in the harsh Utah desert. The conditions were brutal, but the staff were even worse."," It goes from DARK to DARKER to DARKEST! [+61%]: I think the piece grants more screen time than required to cover the muddled opinions of Steve Cartisano's family (who sound so full of themselves) and much less on the victims and the tragedies they faced. That could either be an error in judgment on the filmmaker's part or, most likely, a Netflix decision to try to soften the emotional blow until the closing moments. Institutionalized abuse and the resulting trauma are discussed in all their somber detail, in what feels like American parents trying to run behind quick fixes for habitual (and often psychological) issues of their teenagers.While I'm not surprised that wilderness therapy camps continue to exist in the States, given there are people who willingly sign up for haunted experiences and get tormented (oh, watch that documentary too if you must), what bothers me is how some folks still believe in the ideology of putting teenagers through clearly abusive methods to ""teach them a lesson"" and ""turn them into good people"". And if you're you're gonna say ""Stuff like this would never happen in 2023"", then I guess you're the one living under a rock. Worse things happens today.~arungeorge13 rated 6/10 on 27 December 2023"," Shocking, but interesting.: Parents that had no idea of how to deal with their children, decide it's a good idea to send them out to the middle of the desert, in extreme temperatures, run by a man named Steve Cartisano. This is not a movie, people, I kid you not, this is a true story.I've said it before, and I'll say again, as a Brit, I find some of the thought processes over in The States, Alien, who on Earth with half a brain cell would think this was a good idea, let's be honest, this happened in recent memory, not the 1800's.I honestly couldn't believe what I was watching, that said it's a very well made and interesting documentary, although you may find it hard to understand the actions of many people.Whilst the theory of teaching young people discipline, isn't exactly outrageous, what did they honestly think was going to happen under the circumstances, no law enforcement......there's the red flag right there.'A gift working with kids,' well clearly not, these occurrences happened on his watch.That mother?????? I have no words, that poor girl.Why do people have kids if they don't know how to parent them.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 29 December 2023"," Good, but it definitely left stuff out. I know from experience.: I was in the last group to run-in in Utah before the state of Utah shut them down. I still have scars on my body the whole time I was there. I had sores that I'd have to walk on for four months. I was 13..never did drugs, never drank alcohol, never partied, never had a run-in with the , and was still a virgin, just a normal teenager who didn't pick up her room. My mom thought this would be a way to get me to ""be a good girl"". The description of ""out of control teenagers"" is wrong... there were a lot of normal kids there. Kids with parents that just didn't want to be a parent.. or in my case just wanted someone to teach me a lesson.~sailingforlife rated 9/10 on 28 December 2023"," Deeply devastating and horrifying: I think the poor reviews are due to the perpetrator's family and children's parents being featured. But this tactic is not uncommon - that does not mean the documentary makers agree with their perspectives. If anything, including them highlights their hypocrisy and evil.The accounts of the children - because they are children (the label 'teens' diminishes this) - sent to wilderness camps was genuinely devastating and moving. This camp might have reformed behavior for some kids, but torture is not an acceptable method of reforming behavior.I feel almost no empathy for the parents. At minimum, they knew they were approving a staged kidnapping for their children. The kidnapping in itself can be traumatizing. Knowing that your parents signed off on your torture is even more traumatizing.This documentary should have also included the names of all the children who have died in wilderness camps inspired by Steve's. This man's evil should not be minimized in any way. A lot of people need to be in jail right now.~ravenclaw_girlrules rated 10/10 on 28 December 2023"," Heartbreaking: What in the world possessed these parents to pay a known abuser tens of thousands of dollars to ""fix"" their teenage children. I would say it's a case of more money than sense but one sold her house to be able to afford these so called teen camps that heal your child not only of laziness but drugs & anger issues.My heart goes out to the now adult teenagers who still struggle because their parents paid to have them kidnapped and sent to hell camps, as per the title, to have them abused in so many ways a child should never know. With parents still not admitting fault.Don't get me started on the wife of the founder of these camps. She's either in on the abuse or a complete idiot. To still speak highly of the abuser. Absolutely revolting.~anastasiaconstantinou rated 10/10 on 27 December 2023"," Camps from Hell: A deluded unpleasant person called Steve Cartisano who is basically a fraudster and criminal with no proper qualifications or training runs a Wilderness Camp for teens who need proper help. Instead of giving the children help and guidance his camps are awful places which generally abuses the children at the same time getting big fees from the parents who ought to know better.Cartisano's family and associates are interviewed, and they came across as deluded and devious as he is.Shocking how kids can be badly mistreated when it take so long for the authorities to try to take action,. We also learn that Cartisano also committed sexual abuse on at least one of the victims.He had his own children who were addicts etc.The producers ought to have been more sever on showing this was totally a criminal enterprise masquerading as doing good:6/10.~rbrb rated 6/10 on 31 December 2023"," Institutional abuse victims perspective: As a survivor of abuse of Saint John's cathedral boys school , this documentary is highly triggering. Up here in canada this ""school"" ,renowned as the toughest boys school in North America , made many aspects of hell camp seem mild in comparison. Ultra right wing Christians well connected politically coupled with dogma addled parents allowed the abuse to continue for decades . Low paid untrained ""teachers"" dragged and beat the kids through death defying wilderness trips to toughen them up , classrooms where teachers were armed with giant swat sticks beat the kids liberally . No telephone access . Many deaths from the extreme wilderness trips . And ultimately sexual abuse survivors also . What ""well meaning"" ""parents"" fail to realize is that although such programs ""save"" a few , they leave littered along the side of the road scores of victims burdened with PTSD and physical scars for the rest of their lives .~jeffreybirkin rated 9/10 on 29 December 2023"," The Wholes Family's Crazy: From hiking the desert to child slave labor, this Steve. Cartisano guy was a real psychopath who preyed on distraught families once their kids started acted out. This man had a real evil about him that seemed obvious to most the kids but not the dumb parents who were paying outrageous fees just for their children to be bullied into behaving better, a method which always works. Steve is the real POS here no doubt about it but the documentary would have been better if we heard less from his wife who made him sound like a pioneer and almost heroic. Her along with their daughter keep trying to say he had nothing do with the bad things that happened, not only at 1 but 3 of his camps since he was never there. Not really a great argument for a man preaching how much he cares.~joefiloramo rated 6/10 on 27 December 2023"," So Much: At beginning of doc, I think ""this is a great idea! Kids need some discipline. They are unbearable to live with, using drugs, getting in trouble at school and with the law."" Let them have some consequences by being out in the wilderness. I felt for the parents. I have raised teenagers and at times, I really felt helpless and completely disrespected. A prisoner in my own home and treated like a criminal by my own children.But then, a poor girl dies...of course from the extreme weather conditions she endured in this camp. Not close to any medical help. And Steve Cartisano says he is not responsible. His wife says he is not responsible. How could he be? He wasn't there? At this point I'm screaming at the television. How obtuse? How stupid? How entitled?Somehow, with a high profile attorney, he beats the charges of negligence causing death. Instead of sailing off into the sunset, he opens another camp ""on the water."" He doesn't have permission to dock on the islands that he sails to, and again, he should not be held accountable because ""he is never there"". It starts to look like "" Lord of the Flies"". His wife is very sad because there is no more money coming in. His children are also sad because the authorities shut the camp down.But then this Steve Cartisano tries his hand one last time, opening a camp in Samoa, and sends his drug addicted son there. There are reports of sexual abuse. And physical abuse. A video tape is proof. The camp is shut down. The US embassy rescues the remaining kids. Steve Cartisano faces no charges.At the end of the movie, one of the kids in the Utah camp, I believe, accuses Steve Cartisano of fondling her breasts. She was only a teenager. Her mother does not pursue legal action against Cartisano, thinking it will stop him from helping kids. So sick.I couldn't help but think that karma came for Cartisano. He died very young of colon cancer, his son who was a drug addict is currently in jail, and his clueless daughter ( she couldn't understand why the authorities were coming after her dad....) also had a rough time on drugs. What goes around comes around.~DVK1234 rated 7/10 on 30 December 2023"," Would've been better as a mini series: This documentary is okay. But it seems like they're trying to fit so many things that happened into a ""small"" documentary. It would've been better if it were a mini series then they could've gone deeper into every aspect of the things that happened and possibly more things that happened. Even the ending is lacking in the fact that it needs something. The ending basically feels like a teaser for another documentary that is about these kinds of camps but not run by that Steve guy. Just make a docuseries that focuses on these types of camps but have the main camp be his camps.All in all it's a horrible thing to have happened to these kids (now adults) but the fact that these camps still exist baffle me.~ernaeke rated 7/10 on 31 December 2023"

We first noted that every girl was dressed up and was just so happy. When the film started, there was an excitement I've never experienced. Everyone was so happy. The film started and we soon realized this would be different than anything we've experienced. As soon as the music started, every girl in the theater started to sing. And, I mean sing loud. We looked at each other and wondered if it was just the first song. Nope. It wasn't the first song as it would be every single song after that. I've never experienced anything like this in a theater. It was so much fun and highly recommended.~robby77777 rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Kind of hard to review this one, but yeah, I see the hype: My wife is an ENORMOUS Taylor Swift fan and we've been trying to get tickets to see this concert for months. Suffice to say, when tens of millions of people across Canada are also trying, it's not very easy. Taking her to see this was a treat, even if our theatre was kind of quiet and lame. We genuinely expected more of a concert vibe, but unfortunately, even the amazing staff at our cinema, who tried their hardest to hype people up, couldn't do it.To say that this concert really fits the cinematic experience would be an understatement. You don't have to love TS (although, 17 years of making music, there has to be a couple songs you know...admit it), but this concert does a phenomenal job of showcasing what makes her special. The sets, the outfits, the distinct visual and sonic style of the Eras...let's just say, the whole room shimmers.Taylor is an incredible performer and has amazing stage presence. She simultaneously feels like a a girl sitting on the bleachers and trouble as soon as she walks in. Her outfits gleam in the Los Angeles night and she commands the room in a way few artists do. For the film specifically, the cinematography is honestly fantastic and not only makes you feel as it you're on stage with her, but allows you take in the enormity of the moment tooDon't what else to say, if you're a Swifty, you belong in a theatre watching this thing. If you're not, you'll be enchanted to meet her.(And yes, this concert did what all great concerts do. Make you appreciate the artist even more. I'm a soft Swifty now.)~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 9/10 on 17 October 2023"," A newer, better and cheaper way to enjoy a concert: Not only were Swift's tickets expensive as hell (700+ for a VIP. What?) but I would have had to travel to a different city and stay the night in a hotel to see the concert.Not worth it.So I was really pleased when Swift announced a movie of her 3 hour long concert for theaters.And boy was this amazing.The sets, the costumes, the lighting, the props and the videos were absolutely sublime and gorgeous to look at. The dancers and the backup singers gave it their all in their choreography and singing.And then there's Taylor herself.Her goofy, lovable personality was on full display, as well as her prowess and blooming confidence as she strutted the stage in hella sparkly costumes crooning out all of her best hits from all her albums.Had I been there, no doubt my bank account would have been empty and I would have ended up being squeezed with a bunch of Swifties, barely catching a glimpse of the songstress. Instead, the camera focuses lovingly on Taylor from all angles throughout the show. And no extra charge for a pair of glasses. Plus I giggled as the ardent Swifties in the cinema got up from their seats to dance and form circles in front of their beloved.Great choice to film and to share it in the cinema. :)~Avwillfan89 rated 9/10 on 19 October 2023"," Spectacular sets, choreography, music and cinimatography: I am hardly what I would consider to be in the ""Taylor Swift"" demographic. A man past 70. But a female friend of mine liked it, and I like music so I went to see it tonight.This is called the ""Eras Tour"" because the 3 hour show is divided into the various eras of her songwriting, with different stage sets and dress for each ""era"".I read a few weeks ago, in the WSJ of all places, a bit about her tour - requiring 50 semis to carry all of the stage equipment from city to city. I was thinking just of the logistics and of all the people ""behind the scenes"" who put all of this together.When you see the show, you wonder how they could do all of this in 50 trucks.This was filmed at the last stop of her tour, the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, CA.It was sold out.The visuals are spectacular, the costumes, sets, and of course her music.And you are right on stage with her.It isn't simply a recording of the show with 2 or 3 cameras angles but a very well thought out production and with a mystery to me, not an external camera in sight as you see various angles of the massive stage.Very well done in all respects.~wlb rated 9/10 on 21 October 2023"," 🎆 WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE! 🎇⚡: Just Got out Of The Eras Tour Dolby Cinema, I'm Going to See this Again in IMAX next Weekend.Taylor Swift is such an Efficient and Unique Performer and her Songwriting is at times Remarkable (Yes, I know she has Co-writers for Many of her Songs). 🎤Taylor Swift -1. She's Gorgeous to look at.2. She was Performing so well in the Routines and Singing.3. The Edits were Spot on 👌4. The Cinematography was in certain Scenes Breathtaking (especially the Shots of Taylor Swift with the Huge Scale Audience or Stage Behind her)5. Her Speeches in Between every other Couple of Segments added even more to the Show.6. I loved/liked Her different Costumes, the different Stage Layouts and Lighting, back up dancers and the band.But here's what in my opinion, really makes Taylor Swift a Very Unique Performer -7. She has a know-how, she has a Brightness or Likeability to her Facial Expressions, also her Physiognomy coupled with her own added personal Face Mannerisms and Look Mannerisms adds more to her. She also has this certain type of Elegance about her that adds to her Singular Ability to pull off what she does and how she does it. She's a Superstar.There's a few moments when the crowd was just applauding and cheering for Taylor and it was Roaring in Dolby Cinema.It was Such an Outstanding PerformanceBonus - She has Great Face Symmetry both when Frowning and Smiling 👌Segments -Lover - Excellent introduction to the Show 👌💖. ""The Man"" Song and Stage Layout was so Good to Watch. WHAT A PERFORMANCE!Fearless - Solid Segment to Keep the Ball Rolling.

Sure, we didn't get to see the concert live... but this was very much the next best thing (especially in IMAX with a large crowd of excited, passionate Swifties)! It made for such a fun, truly impressive experience! It's truly a spectacular achievement in terms of cinematography, editing and sound for a concert film - it's really something special to treasure forever. I would even say this is likely the greatest concert film ever made... due to both the insane production value of the show, and the impressive work put in to film it all! Some of the shots/coverage they got blew me away, and the sound was excellent! They did such a good job of making you feel like you were there, feeling the energy and emotion of every song along with the crowd at SoFi stadium! It's infectious, and my god is it ever so exhilarating to experience with a full theatre of fans!But nothing would have made this experience what it is if it wasn't for Taylor Swift herself, who enchants with talent, charisma, grace and stamina to carry such a long event like it was the easiest and most natural thing! She puts on a show that can feel intimate even in a stadium setting. Swift has a way of making every viewer feel like she's personally performing for them whether they are sitting in the back row of a stadium or in a movie theatre. This is possibly the most famous performer in the world, but she engages her audience with humility. She's such a talented performer and put together one of the most elaborate and stunning concerts I've ever seen.My favourite eras during the concert: Lover, Red, 1989 and especially Reputation!Excellent vibes, unparalleled cinematic experience for a concert. It's a must see in IMAX!Only problem is it made me want to see this show live even more...~parksiet rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Taylor Swift - Phenomenal Performer, Businesswoman, & Human Being: I got the luxury of seeing this beautifully produced film of Taylor's Eras Tour on opening night at the Big Mo Drive-In Theater (Monetta, South Carolina). Taylor did not fly in on a helicopter, but emotionally, I felt like she did! It was packed with Swifties & other people from all walks of life. It started out and people were screaming and clapping as if it were the actual concert. The movie itself had effortless transitions and preserved the beauty throughout the concert. I am a trained opera singer with a degree in Vocal Performance (I even have perfect pitch) , and I am here to say that Taylor sang with marvelous pitch, technique, resonance, and stage presence throughout the concert film. Her entire team of singers & dancers were great, as well, and I mean phenomenally great! The actors featured in her story songs in Folklore and Evermore were amazing, as well! In my opinion, there weren't any weak points in the entire movie. Her mini-speeches beautifully connected the songs when she chose to add them in, her outfits were gorgeous, & her live performances of HER music was unmatched. Is it too early to say it was timeless? ;)~Gleek4eva rated 10/10 on 14 October 2023"," Tour of an Era: I've heard that Swift's concerts are expensive to attend to. So recording them and putting them into an accessible format she can monetize even more, is just good business. Just like how I constantly see BTS' events here, where we are far and away from anywhere.If you are not a fan of her safe and generic songs, there's nothing to get out of this, as the theatrics do little to impress or highten the shallow experience.. it's just not the same as being surrounded by thousands of people, and enjoying the energy. Here you get 3 long hours of an exhausting event and nothing more. There's no added backstage recordings, preparations or stories to tell or anything that would make this a worthwhile for movie goers.. so calling this a ""movie"" is somewhat insulting (but it does help in selling it, I guess).You know who you are and what you like, so the recommendation is a no brainer.~daisukereds rated 4/10 on 18 October 2023"," Good, but not great: First off, I want to say I went to the Eras Tour in Los Angeles on night four, right after a the filming of this movie. It was awesome! By far the most fun I've ever had at a concert. So I was glad to hear the movie of this show was coming sooner than expected. That's where I think they went wrong. The grand scale of this show wasn't showcased in this movie. There were too many closeups of Taylor and not enough wide shots of the stage sets and the stadium/crowd. The sound was good, but honestly I thought it could have been better. I just don't think the production had enough time to properly mix the audio. I thought the Reputation All Stadium Tour film was really good, and with all the hype surrounding this epic tour, a little more time editing of this film could have made it even better. My hope is that there will eventually be a Directors cut, or maybe a Taylor cut that includes all the songs, including the surprise songs in the future. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm putting down the production, I am not. With the time they had, I'm sure it's the best they could do. Great job though, recording a live 3-1/2 hour show and editing out all the cameras must have taken up most of the time because on first viewing I didn't see a single camera. I can't wait to see this again at home and enjoy the Eras Tour for many years to come.~themanford rated 8/10 on 16 October 2023"," Even those who aren't fans of Taylor Swift, this concert movie is still a really fun to watch: As a whole, it was a good watch.It's a fun concert movie with great production, camerawork and fun musical performances and acts from Taylor Swift. I am not a fan of Taylor Swift but growing up, I had enjoyed quite a few songs from her. Especially with her songs ""22, Bad Blood, Style, and Love Story"" I really liked. The production sets, colors, and the camerawork is insanely colorful and demonstrates the big energy and atmosphere presented. I did enjoy that the concert had some creative moments with its structures as the sets, dancers, melody and tone were like telling a form of theme and narrative.Since I haven't been following Swift's recent works, many of the new songs were a mix of some I really liked listening to and some I didn't really like much. Though some of her older songs have brought some nostalgic vibes back. The sound mixing from the audio and music is amazing to which it helps create if you are at the concert. The dancers all provide good energy and feel to the environment though admittedly some of the dancers movements and expressions were slightly cringey at times.Overall, it's a good concert movie that fans will enjoy and good for music lovers to have some fun.~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 14 October 2023"
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017) - IMDb,7.4,Jim Arnott|David Blanchard|Dee Dee Blanchard|Gypsy Rose Blanchard|Kristy Blanchard|Rod Blanchard|Michelle Dean|Marc Feldman|Bernard Flatersten|Nicholas Godejohn|Charles Goldhammer|Stephanie Goldhammer|Calvin Holden|Linda Ong|Dan Patterson|Bobby Pitre|Claude Pitre|Emma Pitre,Erin Lee Carr,,"In this documentary, the murder of Deedee Blanchard by her daughter Gypsy Rose is explored, as well as the circumstances leading up to the event."," The sad tale of Gypsy Rose Blancharde: Gypsy Rose was the only child of Dee Dee Blancharde, a master manipulator and sociopath who apparently learned, maybe inherited those traits from her own mother. She fed Round-up to her grandmother, who managed to survive, may have possibly starved her own mother to death when she got to be too big of a medical burden, and got pregnant by a 17 year old boy when she was 24. If the sexes had been reversed she might have gone to jail or at least been registered as a sex offender. Instead, Rod Blancharde married her. But Dee Dee was too dark for the minor with her tales of witchcraft and her pet tarantula, and the marriage did not last long.So why are we here? In 2015 Gypsy Rose Blancharde arranged to have her boyfriend kill her mother as she slept, and then they celebrated with sex in the same house as the corpse and then stole Dee Dee's money - about 5K lying around the house - and went back to Wisconsin to live with the boy's folks. The police quickly figured out what happened, because Gypsy and her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, both left a trail a mile wide on Facebook about their exploits. At first the police thought this was a boiler plate murder situation - daughter and mother fight, daughter solicits the help of the boyfriend to kill mom, sociopath daughter and boyfriend go out and celebrate with mom's money. Thus Gypsy was initially charged with first degree murder.But then a closer look revealed that Gypsy was as much a victim as anybody. Since birth Dee Dee Blancharde had used her daughter to get money and attention by claiming she had multiple illnesses - muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, cancer, and gastrointestinal problems that required a feeding tube into which meds for all of the illnesses I just mentioned were pumped. Gypsy never went to school, never had any kind of relationship with anybody except mom, and believed she had all of these illnesses except the muscular dystrophy, because she knew she could walk, but was instructed not to by mom whenever people were around. She didn't even know her true age until after the murder because she had no concept of time. If a doctor got suspicious - not too many did - Dee Dee would just switch doctors. When somebody reported possible abuse, Dee Dee sweet-talked the deputies that visited out of believing the accusations. Dee Dee even got papers drawn up saying Gypsy was incompetent, so if she had ever tried to make a break for it, mom could have the law bring her right back to mom and her prison cell.What Dee Dee did not count on was Gypsy's puberty and online access getting her involved with a member of the opposite sex, and one who had as many mental problems as Dee Dee, maybe just as evil.Given all of the mitigation - to put it mildly - the prosecution realized that Gypsy was not just another natural born killer, but really was painted into a corner, and lacked any idea of what was right or wrong because the only two people in the world she had contact with her entire life were her sexual deviant boyfriend and her sociopath mom. So what happened to Gypsy, now in the clutches of the legal system? Watch and find out.Oh, and don't be too harsh on Gypsy's dad either. He tried to be involved in her life, but Dee Dee kept close tabs on her daughter and moved her around, ultimately out of state, to minimize ties.This was a good documentary that explored all of the angles, but at any angle Dee Dee Blancharde was a monster, and like the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz, it is difficult to feel too sorry for her early demise. Her relatives tended to agree.~AlsExGal rated 8/10 on 4 June 2017"," WTF - oh hell no!: First off, my condolences to the families of everyone who was involved in this crime. Second, this is the true crime story of a little girl whose mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy (and probably some other stuff) and so the little girl orchestrates the death of her mom. The systematic abuse this kid faced is so bad words cannot describe what she went through. This film reminds us that Lady Justice wears a blindfold and holds scales for a good reason. I truly hope that everyone who survived this ordeal can get some help.~RussHog rated 9/10 on 12 August 2018"," A Compelling and Disturbing True Crime Documentary: Mommy Dead and Dearest was extremely well-received in its world premiere today at SXSW Film Festival. This film morphs from apparent case of matricide into one of the journey of Gypsy, a severely abused child. Her journey as recounted in recovered VHS tapes and interviews will shock you even if you think you can no longer be shocked by what human beings are capable of. It is best not to give away too many of the details of Gypsy's story. The filmmakers have taken care to present the story with both sympathy and nuance as we learn the disturbing details behind Gypsy's story and most disturbingly how every institution that was supposed to help her – medical, educational, social workers, the criminal justice system – failed to attenuate the abuse and allowed the conditions that produced this bizarre and disturbing situation to continue. The film is scheduled for HBO and this story deserves to be more widely seen and understood. Unfortunately, in so many ways, the criminal escaped punishment and the victim has been imprisoned by what has happened. The filmmakers have done an excellent job of bringing this troubling story to life for the public.~JustCuriosity rated 10/10 on 11 March 2017"," 2017's ""Tickled"", only better: This story is INSANE. Hard to believe something this complex, fascinating and disturbing could occur in real life. Is Gypsy purely a victim? A pathological liar? An abuse survivor? A mentally confused and stunted young girl? A willing participant? A product of over medication and abuse? Probably a mixture of all of this and more, each taking its turn at the forefront of her personality. A sad, enrapturing and pulpy crime doc.~matthewssilverhammer rated 8/10 on 30 March 2018"," Truly engrossing documentary: Profoundly disturbing and at the same time, oddly moving, Mommy Dead and Dearest chronicles one of the strangest mother/daughter relationships on record, ultimately leading to a shocking murder. The most amazing thing about this film is that the story is told by the actual participants in the murder — and presented in a pastiche of selfies, taped police interrogations, surveillance video, and prison interviews, making the viewer feel almost as if they are present as the crime is committed and in its immediate aftermath. Unlike so many of today's documentaries, this one eschews the endless drone shots flying over the scene of the crime, the lingering but meaningless long shots of empty streets and wilting flowers. The focus is 100% on the principals of the story. The editing is lean and clean. This is documentary filmmaking at its finest.~jake_fantom rated 10/10 on 1 July 2017"," Just as heartbreaking as it is horrific: Truly one of the best true crime documentaries I have seen lately. This is not your normal true crime case. It's very well presented by the filmmakers and will cause many mixed emotions as you learn the whole story behind it. I don't want to give away anything for those who don't know the case, but just know that it is just as heartbreaking as it is horrific.~Mister-Creeper rated 9/10 on 18 May 2017"," This poor little girl: I feel so bad for Gypsy! I do not understand how she slipped through so many cracks! How could these idiot doctors do these treatments and surgeries on this child without seeing the medical evidence; making them necessary! I just don't get it! I am more angry at the doctor that said she was a victim of Munchausen by proxy but did not do his duty, as far as, getting her away from her mother immediately!She suffered 20 years of abuse and imprisonment! I totally agree with her grandmother! She paid in advance for this crime and should be set free. I believe that if this was taken to trial, she would be free. I wish her nothing but the best for the rest of her life. Maybe by some miracle, Dr. Phil can help her start living sooner than later. The lawyers, the prosecutors, and the judge are complete morons in this case! Hasn't she suffered enough!?Yes, she did take part in murdering her mother! But a better turn of events would have been the doctor protecting her while her mother rotted in prison! Because EVERYONE failed this child, she really had no other way out! God bless you Gypsy!~wildcatfalling rated 7/10 on 21 November 2017"," One of the Most Disturbing Stories I've Ever Heard: I don't know where to begin. I am one hour into this documentary, and about twenty-two minutes are left. I am completely horrified by everything I've seen sovfar.I have never heard of this crime, the people involved, anything. This tale, which is not simply a crime story, is probably the most horrifying incident I've ever heard in my life, and it's not the murder itself that is the most disturbing, but rather, ALL that led up to it. All that Gypsey Rose endured her entire life up until her mother's murder. And, she'll probably need a lifetime of expensive therapy which she'll never be able to afford. The lofetime of hprror that that mother inflicted upon her daughter gave me the chills, and I was completely uncomfortable, unsettled, disgusted, revolted and horrified by what that woman did to her daughter, and equally as much by how the system COMPLETELY failed her. She endured purposeful, systematic, abuse by her mother, and the system FAILED her completely her entire life. Her life heretofore has been a complete freak show.I hope she will be able to start a new life. Somehow.~mmitsos-1 rated 8/10 on 5 December 2020", Such a heartbreaking story: Gypsy's story is so sad and it's so heartbreaking to see what happened to her. I feel for her so much. I understand why she did what she did. The documentary is really good in showing you her point of view and what she went through.~snperera rated 8/10 on 10 April 2019," Premature and manipulative, but not bad: ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well-edited and put together film. It tells the narrative behind the Gypsy Rose Blamchard case in a coherent way, and it introduces the viewers to most pertinent characters to try to get a complex overview of this bizarre case. The directors succeed in trying to present the case in an objective way, talking to family members, police officers, lawyers, doctors and psychologists alike, but nonetheless there is still a problematic bias in this documentary as well an odd and conflicting ambivalence, as if the filmmakers both oversimplified and overcomplicated their narrative at different turns. These insidious manipulations aggravate an otherwise technically proficient documentary, which is nonetheless likely to be one of the better ones out there. Despite the notion of a happy ending ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives, I have a feeling there is more to complicate the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.Viewers note that while Gypsy Rose Blanchard has been given ten years prison time, the man she asked to murder her mother Dee Dee for her, Nicholas Godejohn, has been given a lifetime sentence and Gypsy is effectively done with him. Psychologists interviewed within the film have given Gypsy the doubt of bein a sociopath, and while I appreciate how the filmmakers didn't shy away from that I question whether they haven't manipulated events (the family reunion with Gypsy's father) in too much favor for her. If they haven't, then just be aware that the something here is still pretty messed up, and the answer ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives is far too pat.Even still, ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well told, but probably premature documentary, and I don't believe it's the full story it is made out to be. Some kudos to the filmmakers for making some notion of possible discrepancies, apthough not going far enough in exploring them so as to feel fully fledged or complete.Mixed feelings about this one.~Hallelujah289 rated 5/10 on 11 May 2019"
American Symphony (2023) - IMDb,7.2,Jon Batiste|Lindsey Byrnes|Suleika Jaouad|Louis Cato|Stephen Colbert|Billie Eilish|Simon Helberg|Lenny Kravitz|Trevor Noah|Questlove|Joe Saylor|James Taylor|Scott Tixier|Stevie Wonder,Matthew Heineman,,"In this deeply intimate documentary, musician Jon Batiste attempts to compose a symphony as his wife, writer Suleika Jaouad, undergoes cancer treatment."," A Beautifully Touching Film: Creating a great work of art is very much like creating a heartfelt, loving relationship. Both take work and commitment, both in good times and bad. The challenges can be difficult, but the rewards can be incalculable. Learning how to successfully maneuver through them, as well as how to strike a harmonious balance that keeps both ventures moving forward, is a skill that takes an array of abilities and aptitudes s to master, but, as documentary filmmaker Matthew Heinenman's latest so deftly illustrates, it's an attainable goal, the prevailing highs and lows notwithstanding. The film follows the extraordinary year experienced by musician/composer Jon Batiste and his wife, best-selling author Suleika Jaouad. In 2022, they came face to face with both ends of the spectrum of life. Batiste, an artist with an impressive musical range and repertoire, was reaching new heights in his career, winning five Grammy Awards while serving as band leader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and seeking to complete work on an ambitious composition aimed at reflecting the breadth of our national music, diversity and culture, American Symphony. At the same time, though, Jaouad suffered a recurrence of the cancer she battled a decade earlier, an illness she chronicled in writings that would come to launch a career; now, after a 10-year remission, she was facing a second, potentially risky bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, not to mention an uncertain future. With such seemingly polar opposite fates befalling them, Batiste and Jaouad struggled to get through their respective challenges while keeping their love and art alive, putting their successes into perspective in light of what they were up against otherwise. This intimate, heartstring-tugging documentary gives viewers a candid, up-close look at what a truly loving couple can experience under such diverse, trying and bittersweet circumstances, but without becoming manipulative or melodramatic. This beautifully photographed story provides an unfiltered depiction of the range of emotions that each partner goes through, particularly when it comes to its depictions of the philosophical insights observed by each of the spouses. It also showcases Batiste's wide-ranging musical styles, both in his performances and in his composition process. Admittedly, a few of this offering's sequences meander a bit, but the overall production is skillfully edited and sensitively portrayed. ""American Symphony"" is a beautifully moving film, one that reinforces what matters most in life and what makes it worth living, during both good times and bad, as long as we have each other to make our way through it, bringing new meaning to what our marriage vows are ultimately all about.~brentsbulletinboard rated 8/10 on 30 November 2023", American Symphony Scores !!: Not the movie everyone expected but the movie eveyone needs - a beatifully done film that is powerful and engaging - the movie that delivers hope and promise for all of us - Jon Batiste and his wife Suleika have their lifes journeys before them - Unexpected twists and turns force both of them to reflect of their goals - their lives - their relationship - when Suleikas cancer returns - how they both deal with all of lifes responsibilities - while facing an unforseen crisis that turns their worlds upside down - a movie piece of filmmaking created with much love - a testament to the power of hope - of lasting dreams - and how to create a loving relationship that weathers all that lifes complexities have to offer - better or worse - wonderfully done - a must-see -~raymondmuller rated 9/10 on 27 October 2023," Incredibly moving: Suleika and Jon are each incredible, multi-talented artists and we see that in this film.

It's been a while since a show... and these two beautiful people...moved me like this.Thank you for sharing this, for being who you are, and for showing us what's possible when you open your heart and allow yourself to be vulnerable. I will watch this again and I urge others to watch it.~bdb-76814 rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"," So moving: American Symphony is an incredibly personal documentary that strikes a very strong balance between its portrayal of the artistic process and a beautiful relationship. It may be conventional but when it's so well crafted and its story is so emotionally resonant it's near impossible not to be moved or affected by any of this.Jon Batiste is very open here, showing so much in what feels like a very real look at his life and struggles. A magnetic presence when on the stage yet so humbling and relatable in everyday life. It's so interesting to watch his ideas forming in real time whilst his relationship with Suleika Jaouad gives the film its strongest moments.Matthew Heineman's direction manages to be very cinematic in its construction whilst still being able to maintain a consistent sense of intimacy. The structure of the film is really good too, building to the titular symphony in classic biopic fashion which gives it so much weight. Batiste's music and closing song really compliments everything and further foregrounds his undeniable talent.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 1 December 2023"," peek inside the curtains: Musician Jon Batiste is composing a symphony while his wife/writer Suleika Jaouad undergoes cancer treatment. This is a documentary. I know Jon Batiste only through ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"". My surface take on him is radical positivity. It's more than being Ed McMahon. He seems like a guy who reacts with a smile no matter what the situation. This movie lets the audience a peek inside the curtains. There are moments. There are big moments of anxiety and doubt and depression. It may be small little peeks, but they are enough to paint a picture of the man and his relationship with his wife. Those extra paint colors really sets off the climatic musical performance.~SnoopyStyle rated 7/10 on 20 December 2023"," Wondrous journey into two souls: 2022 was the best of times, the worst of times for Jon Batiste and Suleika Janouad.Both. Everywhere. All at once. In every moment.It was the year the couple married. It was the year Jon left his high-profile gig leading the band on The Late Show with Steven Colbert. He would go on to win five Grammys, including the coveted Album of the Year, which hadn't been won by a Black artist in more than a decade.Although Suleika's bestselling ""Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life Interrupted"" would be acclaimed as one of the best books of the 2022, she would spend most of the year in hospital beds, receiving chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and other treatments for the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia, a rare condition that had first stricken her a decade earlier.On September 22 of that year, Jon Batiste premiered his ""American Symphony"" in Carnegie Hall. His wife was in the audience.These events provide the framework for Matthew Heineman's powerfully affecting documentary that shares the title of Batiste's musical creation. Its Higher Ground production company was created by Michelle Obama and her husband in 2018 with the goal of lifting diverse voices in the entertainment industry. It's playing on Netflix.It feels meant to be, writing about ""American Symphony"" after recent blogs reviewing ""Maestro"" and ""American Fiction."" They have a lot in common. Like ""Maestro,"" it presents a loving marriage of creative giants, the husband fulfilling his artistic genius, the wife beset by setbacks and pain beyond belief.Like ""American Fiction,"" it focuses on a brilliant Black artist staking his creative claim in a society built on a foundation of the enslavement of his race. (The similarity of the films' titles is unfortunate, confusing and diluting each's powerful impact during this awards season.)Except, unlike the other two films, ""American Symphony"" doesn't have actors. It has the actual people. They're not acting, they're living their lives.Filmmaker Heineman is the third member of their marriage, capturing an intimacy that rarely makes its way to the screen. He's there with them in their bedroom or her hospital bed, as they grapple with everything coming their way. In one light-hearted interlude, Suleika takes Jon to the snow. He has never sledded before. We ride down the hill with them, lost for a moment in giddy, silly escape.But not for long.Pain, isolation and discomfort are givens in Suleika's illness. What's not expected is the resilience, philosophical strength and occasional bursts of humor she finds to face them. In her bed she starts painting giraffes. They quite good, actually.By her side supporting her, Jon is also up against a different set of challenges. Scion of a New Orleans musical dynasty, his gifts transported him to Juilliard en route to a rarified place in the musical hierarchy where fame itself may become his greatest danger.Heineman - and his three co-cinematographers - transport us into his brain, recording telephone sessions with Jon's therapist flowing into voice-over commentary that unflinchingly probes his artistic process, and the insecurities besetting artists no matter how much acclaim they achieve.The documentary was filmed in the time of Covid, but finds endless expressiveness in its characters' eyes. When they remove their masks, their faces are visually striking element in the film's grand design. Jon's smile is sunshine; his dance moves are joy itself.The creation of Batiste's symphony provides a plot of sorts, as he mines deep ore in all the cultures that have produced ""America,"" beginning with the Indigenous people who were here when the Whites arrived, bringing the Blacks in chains a short time later. He melds their sounds into a musical masterwork that defies labels - classical, jazz, roots, blues, bebop, hip-hop and a hundred others - because it's them all.But the film's real symphony isn't just the music. It's the two people/ at the center of the story, bravely leading us on this wondrous journey into their souls.~rickchatenever rated 8/10 on 17 December 2023"," Love is art: This Documentary is a poignant tale about life, love and art.

Watching the story arch build you get an intimate peak inside what makes Jon Baptiste, the person behind the music, and his highly collaborative creative process. As well as Jon Batiste the family man.

The typical rock star vibe, I guess. Absolutely wrong! Not even close. This is an amazing film about a person who is more than we suppose him to be.John Baptiste is an amazing human, amazing musician, so much feeling expressed through thoughts, actions, movement, embracing everyone, leading everyone. Feeling expressed as action, music, words, thoughts. It is a heavy burden to carry. This film portrays all of this so well that you feel what is happening. You do not just watch it. And it is not all happy but it is moving towards a better outcome.Now, I want to know more about this interesting person through his music, through his good works, through his writing. Our world is made better, larger with him in it, I feel somehow. I need to experience his music to understand more.

Eternal hope and realism and pure love.This was my first introduction to Suleika. What a force and gorgeous artist. She makes me want to pick up my paint brushes again.They are making quite an imprint in this world. Individually and ultimately together.Thank you for making this movie.

Whatever that is take it and excel with it. In the sadness there is joy to be found. You can not watch this without seeing John Babtist and his partner as pure joy. For in even the darkest times there is joy. That's the theme here and it's beautiful. As a documentary I'd say it's more of a piece of art than a documentary. Touching at every turn. The good the bad , the really bad and the well deserved super good! Watch the first 10 minutes and you'll know if it's for you. I'm betting it is. I'm betting on you. By the end you'll be feeling the increased desire to be the best you can be, find your love, be a blessing to others and find the joy. Bravo!!!~kcitraro rated 10/10 on 5 December 2023"

This documentary is pretty strange and weird, but I really like this film.Throughout, the visual presentation and sound designs helps to capture the essence of a sauna, tone, and environment of Estonia. The words expressed from the participants are interesting as they helped to provide quite memorizing discussions about womanhood and their bodies. Each direction felt like the film was taking a half documentary and half narrative type style with beautiful soundtrack and writing throughout.The idea of people going in saunas to have spiritual experiences is quite fascinating.This won the Directing, Screenwriting and Editing award for the World Dramatic Documentary Competition and I can see why. The writing, directing and style of editing is really good and the award was well-deserved.Rating: A-~chenp-54708 rated 8/10 on 4 February 2023"," Honest and moving: The very best documentaries open your eyes to a world that you never knew existed. They take you into the heart of that place where you're more than an observer but less than a participant.""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" achieves that feat on a number of levels. For a start I know nothing about Estonia and even less about its tradition of enjoying rustic sauna huts in the wild birch forest. The process of using these shacks has a very meditational quality about it in the lighting of the fire and the gathering of the water. These simple but foundational acts feel so very appreciated here.At the same time this particular sauna is women only and you see them naked and sweating, safe in this environment and comfortable in their own skins. As a man it's quite something to witness these women being so physically and emotionally vulnerable with each other. They're free to share their deepest fears and concerns in this nurturing space and it's wonderful.The film also looks incredible with shooting clearly taking place in a range of seasons. The little light that makes it into the sauna refracts through shifting veils of smoke and reflects from limbs glowing in the firelight. You can almost smell the wood-smoke.Is it for everyone? Perhaps not but if you have an open mind and a desire to glimpse the lives of others then bag yourself a ticket.~movie-reviews-uk rated 8/10 on 22 October 2023"," Gorgeously captured: If they had used the Sauna Radar portal, such problems would not have happened. I'm kidding=)But seriously, ""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" feels like a work of reflective art, weaving stories of relatable pains and joys as women, allowing all involved to heal and cleanse together. As a viewer, it's comforting to see the different layers of healing found universally.A tidal wave of emotion that builds and builds into a crashing catharsis. While most documentaries thrive on the strength of their story, Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is powerful simply because it accords a group of women the space to tell theirs.~rudenko-80819 rated 9/10 on 30 March 2023"," Women cleansing themselves of their past traumas through communion in a sauna: This is a very intimate exploration of the female psyche, but at the same time it's barely a film. Naked women in South Estonia spend time in a sauna sharing their secrets and pains and thus ritualistically cleansing themselves of them. An interesting concept, I would say especially for young people who have not been exposed to these kind of stories or had never had the opportunity to feel understood by peers and might learn something. There is some beautiful scenery and traditional and mystical rituals that are filmed very nicely, too.However nothing else much happens. If you are in the mood to hear these intimate stories of childhood trauma, love, teen love, abortions, rape, violence, mother daughter relationship, lesbianism, body image issues and so on, this is a great film for you. Yet at the same time it can be considered a loose collection of short female confessions that can be read separately, like a series of blog posts. My wife absolutely loved it. I felt it was not for me, although I appreciated it the format.The sauna in East Estonia and Finland and those areas is not merely a thing you do for pleasure, but has deep roots in their old culture, even pre-Christian and may have roots in rituals in the Neolithic. The film touches on that through scenes that show what is being done, but without any explanation. Read about it, it's fascinating.Bottom line: it's a film for women.~siderite rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not exceptional, boring and tiring: I found a movie a bit boring, yes it is touching human drama and stories told in the movie are touching but I think that emotions presented on the screen and via sound are not really making you feel them.At some point of the movie I wanted to leave the cinema because I just couldn't see the value in this film. There are few women in this movie and they all have some strange story and also they go to the same sauna - a bit strange and unlikely!Stories told by them are also a bit ""shallow"" and are being told in very boring way. If this was an audiobook I would say it is good but I feel personally that going to this movie was a waste of time. I also didn't see the connection between stories being said and sauna. Do people go to sauna to talk?From visual perspective movie was also not great, there were few shots in the sauna where apparently it was ""hot"" as people were sweating but you couldn't see it on the picture.I wrote this review after I saw the movie and I felt that I had to say what I feel after watching it. 3/10 sounds a bit low but at the moment I have to say something I don't say often - that I wouldn't watch it again under any circumstances.~grung rated 3/10 on 5 November 2023",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available

Building on the formidable foundation set by 'Homecoming,' this film elevates every aspect: cinematography, sound design, and insightful documentary footage. Personally, having experienced the Renaissance World Tour live, I can attest that the film authentically captures, and at times, surpasses the concert's brilliance.The sound design is a revelation. Witnessed in IMAX, it's an auditory spectacle. The bass reverberates through your body, while Beyoncé's vocals are a perfect blend of power and warmth. I don't think I've ever head Beyoncé sound better, even in a live setting.What surprised me was the emotional depth in the documentary segments. Unlike previous works, 'Renaissance' delves deep into Beyoncé's familial bonds, the album's inspiration, and the particularly arduous planning and rehearsal phases. It's more than just a behind-the-scenes look; it's a journey into the soul of the project, sharing the spotlight with those who inspired and contributed to this monumental experience.The concert footage is simply breathtaking. Regardless of personal opinions about Beyoncé, her ability to deliver an unmatched live performance is undeniable. The film magnifies this brilliance with its stellar camera work, editing, and sound design. The film rips through concert dates, in Everything Everywhere All At Once style editing, and the fashion explodes onto the screen. So many colours and expert concert lighting, it all just looks and sounds so incredible. It's impossible not to be sucked into this experience.'Renaissance' is a testament to the evolution of concert films, much like Beyoncé has redefined live performance throughout her career. This film is a transformative experience, leaving me as exhilarated as when I attended in person. It's a must-see, not just for fans of Beyoncé, but for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking artistry in music and film.~oliverfielding-41700 rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"," Icon, Queen, and Legend!: I have loved Beyonce ever since I was a child! She is a part of my childhood! To see the behind the scenes of her tour is amazing! To see her peformaces up close is mesmerizing!!! She will always be my favorite artist! I think if you love Beyonce then you should definitely watch it! I love real and raw she was in this movie and how she opened up some of her personal life to her fans and the world to see! She has made a mark on this world and will forever have a lasting impact on this world and especially women everywhere! Her talent is like no other! I love her so much!!! This concert will always have a special place in my heart!~snperera rated 9/10 on 5 December 2023"," A Renaissance Of Concert Crafting: Queen Bee Builds the Hive Of Dynamic Delivery:: LIKES:The Sound Quality-Let's get the obvious out of the way and talk about how the theater really maximizes the sound quality in this experience.-A concert requires this be on point, and Beyonce's guidance did not fail to deliver room shaking bass, engaging beats, and q musical storm that shakes the clothes.-Fantastic editing to make sure every sound stays balanced and heard, beautiful support of her vocals, and these background effects kept me ingrained, illustrating a great use of the art of sound making to the highest quality yet.-To even use a trick about a concert snafu and ingraining that...stellar design and clever tricks that really impressed me.The Camera Angles:-You want to feel like you are in the concert and experiencing it from every angle? Then again, props to the editing and film crew of this piece.-Renaissance does great things with the guidance of the camera work, constantly moving around to give you the whole stage timed beautifully to help enhance musical number-Shots of Beyonce's props, key dancing moments and instrument playing, a balance of wide and focused angles, and even crowd views, all achieve a goal of integration that takes this movie to higher levels of concert conversion.-Alongside good filters, high quality imaging, with ingraining a camera phone filming perspective , the movie accomplished for me, an experience that felt like ""I'm there"".The Songs: -I have not been on the tour, nor do I know most of her work outside local radio the last few years, but the concert has a lot of her new edge that other audience members were dancing to.-It's got great power, a live presence that matched the studio recording with clear vocals, and killer stage presence that helps somehow enhance the musical presence of the movie.-So, for fans of her music, you are going to really enjoy what the Queen and her cast, especially her sound engineers, really accomplished much in this regards.The Choreography:-You may not like the music, you may not like the dancers, but it's going to be hard to not give them props for some insane dance numbers they put on in this show.-The control these people have in their bodies with this strength to pull off these taxing movies was impressive to me A few members had my favorite moves, doing so much with stamina and movement really brought something to the stage just past her singing.-Hip hop and Pop and Lock reign the dominant style for me, but the way they keep the coordination and mood, adjust for the angles, and integrate so much into the performance... quite awesome in helping add that concert atmosphere.The Special Effects:-While certainly more impressive in person, Beyonce has brought a stellar show of her stage effects to the silver screen-Laser light show are just the base of this piece, a really cool light effect that does some wicked tricks with the computer screen and the air that would be stellar to see.-Pyrotechnics accomplish much in the way of a contained firework show, helping to give contrast and framing to the impressive props she rides around the stage.-And of course, the massive screen behind her holds character, albeit weird for me, that transitions into some of the coolest stage designs I've seen in a long time. A fine fit of technology with real life effects accomplished much for this reviewer and may be one of the best aspects for theater viewing.The Costumes:-I can't' say most of the outfits were my cup of tea in terms of sexual prowess. But fI was impressed at the designs holding up to the demanding performances.-Color's are bold, alongside a lot of texture based designs with shiny rhinestones, very silky material, and unique prints that are original, matching the energy of the performance and eye catching.-They hold up well to the demanding moves of the wearers, look great in a lot of the lighting, and match the leader's unique outfit with coordination that I find amazing by the design team.-And as this is a concert film, the editing gives you plenty of time with all styles, transitioning the moment on the show to essentially swap the costumes rapidly as if paper dolls were their canvas.The Editing:-Another nod from me, the editing accomplishes a lot with the effects to take all the things above and bring them together in a very engaging piece.-The costume tricks alone were impressive, but there was so much more to the film, a logical presentation of shots and elements to make me feel like VIP concert member.-Alongside picking key moments, there was a great combination of the tour, and parts of the nonconcert material, it helps give you this documentary/concert that has personality and tries to give one the ""full"" experience. Only tripping a few points.The Behind The Scenes:-Perhaps my favorite part of this piece, the behind the scenes was perfect for a geek like me to see how it all comes together to make this giant spectacle.-Construction of the show, the costumes, and the planning took my favorite spot, just seeing so many people coordinating with Beyonce to make this show.-For those who are big on the current movements, you have plenty of praise and representation in this film and even have messages that the queen wants to share that hold the vibes of the concert.-And for those who put the artist on Olympian Goddess level, you'll get more than enough time with her struggles and attitude to the artistry. Some of these, were inspiring for me, primarily seeing the hard work in planning the show and her family history that explains a lot.DISLIKES:Less Editing On Numbers:-Going to a concert, I like to see the whole song like some artists have done, and this movie cut a fair number of songs midway through their performance.-While some of these were brilliant cuts, some of my favorite songs were interrupted too soon for me and I really wanted to se them to closure and what she could cap them with her magical touch.-If this is a concert movie, I kind of wanted a bit more focus on that, including more time with the band shots that sometimes got lost to the other angles.-In addition, I don't need to see about a fourth of the movie flashing to the fans at the concerts. I get it's about unity, and there is a message, but again, I'm here for the concert numbers, where my audience involvement is my fellow theater attendants.The Beyonce Glorification:-My favorite behind the scenes stuff is seeing the hard work of this woman and the planning of the show, seeing the strength to balance work and family to A levels.-But past that point, the movie's portrayal of her personal life and pride did little for a regular person like me.The film felt very edited/social media like, highlights, fake phrasing, and very dramatic messaging that does not do much for me, that it took away from the things I was enjoying seeing.-That effect carried over into the background dancers' tales as well, and though the cultural feel is there, the doctoring and dramatic telling just feel a bit too pushed for me.-And of course, if you aren't a fan of the attitude, you aren't going to like some of the aggressive lines used at times, as it's a very big focus on her new persona which is just not what I like about Beyonce.Too Sexualized:-My concerts of choice are about the music, the dancing, and perhaps not fully on sexual imagery and attitude.-This was not the song list for me, nor the show, with Beyonce's new direction being very aggressive, very big on inviting poses, and lyrics that beat this drum to death.-No shame to anyone who likes this. It's just not the concert experience I particularly like, preferring her previous shows and albums to this show where body, anger, and attitude lyrics are the primary focus.-The message she says is important about loving yourself and pride, but I just felt this movie did not take the best approach to presenting it, going again more PSA than performance.-As the shots showed, the movie was who love her new work and agree whole heartedly with the message, you won't find this a dislike at all, but approaching from a general point, this is again going to be a warning and limitation.The VERDICT:Another win in the concert experience, Beyonce's Renaissance accomplishes much in the way of documentary with musical concert experience. Sensational effects are the thing that won me over to stay in this long movie, seeing so many great shots of wonderful stage effects that really make a theater the optimum way. To build alongside the performance really was impressive to me, and the constant angle changes and editing really optimize the viewing experience. Throw in a wonderful sound editing to help make sure you get everything, alongside creative choices, and well, it's hard not to give props to the work at hand. Alongside an experience of the behind the scenes, including glimpses into her life, well, the Beyonce fan is easily going to give this a 9 or a 10. For me though, the movie doesn't have the song variety of other concerts, focusing more on aggressive sexualization and other political topics that do little for a reviewer like me. When the glimpses are doctored of her life to sometimes fuel that fire, the concert escapism is lost and a regular Joe like me loses the enjoyment despite the message trying to be conveyed. From all of this, my score is difficult to put, but as I'm going for movie overall vs. Concert personification, the scores are going to vary based on how different the media are:Music/Concert/Documentary: 8.0-8.5Movie Overall: 5.0.~rgkarim rated 8/10 on 2 December 2023"," I think I enjoyed the film more than the live concert!: Having attended the Renaissance World Tour in May, I wasn't sure whether I would watch Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce but then I remember how much I enjoyed the Homecoming documentary on Netflix. Not only did I watch it in the end, but I saw it from the balcony of Cineworld's Superscreen which boasts an incredible wall to wall screen, immersive Dolby Atmos sound and two floors which made feel like I was in the a stadium all over again but a little closer and with better sound. This was the perfect screen to soak up a 2 hour and 48 minute spectacle.Firstly, reliving the performances on the big screen was amazing. Viewers feel Beyonce's energy up close and personal as well as that of her dancers, many of whom have become recognisable names and faces over the years. We also see close shots of fan reactions and sometimes see the performance from their vantage point which drives home how mesmeric Beyonce's on screen presence has become. The Renaissance 'tourdrobe' is on full display as we flash between difference performances of the same song which allows the audience to revel in the Beyonce's outstanding wardrobe (Uncle Johnny made it). One of the best things about the 'tourdrobe', is that it's easy to recognise the location you attended based on the outfit Beyonce was wearing, if not the stadium architecture. London was easy to spot! Those who didn't attend live will recognise several outfits from viral clips.Whilst the performances are stunning and worth the admission price, it's the behind the scenes content and commentary from Beyonce that adds the cherry on top without ever feeling that they were taking away from the show. As per usual, Beyonce sweats over each miniscule detail of the show. She praises everybody from the stage crew to the backing dancers, highlighting how important their role is. The is an emotional segment where we witness Blue Ivy's first performance and its aftermath. This is one of many moments that we get to witness between Beyonce and a family member, friend or tour family. Importantly, Beyonce speaks of the motivation and inspiration for the album. A Renaissance, a new beginning where everybody can and should be comfortable in their own skin.This was an entertaining, energetic and insight look into the Renaissance tour.~ta-98251 rated 8/10 on 4 December 2023"," .: ""I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point,"" Beyoncé declares in her new tour documentary, Renaissance. Charting her record-breaking 2023 tour, this film offers an inside-look (written, directed and produced by Beyoncé) at the hive required to build something as extraordinary as those live performances. Because Beyoncé doesn't just put on a show. She puts on the show.It was blamed for the surprise rise in inflation in Sweden back in June. Combined with the equally dominating force of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, the Renaissance shows sent the US economy temporarily surging out of its pandemic slump. Around 2.7 million concertgoers attended Renaissance over the course of five months, while the tour is estimated to have grossed close to half a billion dollars. She's that girl.Beyoncé is supported by all manner of celebrity guests, including fellow pop titan Taylor Swift, who arrives in a sheath of silver. Inside, phones are stowed away in lockbags, while audience members are handed champagne, salted popcorn and Smarties (British chocolate, nice touch). Then, gasps as the woman of the moment (of the year, of the decade!) walks onstage and thanks those who followed her ""formal opulence"" dress code to the letter.""Thank you for coming, thank you for dressing up,"" she says, adding how proud she feels that the film is released on World Aids Day, in honour of her late uncle Jonny. ""Feel free to dance, sing, cry... thank you.""For anyone who doubts the neccessity of a concert film, well, prepare to stand corrected. This isn't just a highlights reel. It's a rare and remarkable look at the staggering, Spielberg-style production that goes into putting on a show like Renaissance.Each two-and-a-half hour event involves myriad costume and set changes, a full troupe of dances, and a setlist spanning the 41-year-old's career to date, from her Destiny's Child days to her surprise 2013 album, Beyoncé, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in two weeks. Renaissance the album, released last year, pays dazzling homage to the Black and queer pioneers of post-Seventies house and disco while also celebrating her own sexual liberation. Songs such as ""I'm That Girl"" and ""Cuff It"" are delivered in a luxurious murmur, like a big cat stretching its limbs out after a good meal. ""You hate me,"" she purrs on ""Cozy""... ""because you want me.""""When I am performing, I am nothing but free,"" she says in the Renaissance film. ""The goal for this tour is to create a place where everyone is free, and no one is judged. Unique."" Regardless of this, it is impossible to deny that Beyoncé has harnessed a level of perfectionism we rarely see in any art form. Not since Prince has a musician wielded such control over their live show. Whether she's exhibiting vocal gymnastics on ""Dangerously in Love"" or rising into the air on a silver horse while wearing a diamond-encrusted harness (Lady Godiva meets Studio 54), everything appears flawless.To achieve this, production has to be handled with the utmost precision. Beyoncé spent four years working with choreographers, designers, crew, sound engineers, medics, security and caterers in the build-up to the tour's launch in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 May. ""In order to perform as many times as we perform, we have three stages,"" she explains at one point in the film. ""As one is getting set up, the other two stages are travelling to the next city and getting built."" Watching women and men dangle from harnesses, assembling giant installations and working out complex floor plans, is like watching an entirely new city being built in real time.Beyoncé allows no room for error. Far from painting her as the benevolent queen, Renaissance shows her in all her business and creative glory. She grills her camera crew: why can't they find a wider lense? Even when there are mistakes, she turns them into new triumphs. The sound cuts out: she seizes the opportunity for yet another dramatic outfit change.Once the concert begins, for the audience it's a case of blink-and-you'll-miss-it. Dancers whirl around the stage; a disco ball descends from the rafters; Beyoncé rides in on a lunar rover while her 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, dances in front. The tempo and sheer spectacle of it all leaves you breathless. No one compares.~gabrielsousaa rated 10/10 on 1 December 2023"," 💎 Man, BEYONCE TRULY IS A LIVING LEGEND! 🦄: Just Got out of a Renaissance Dolby Cinema Screening.I've Now Come to Realise that Beyonce is a One off.I can see why she has won so Many Awards.She's one of those things in Life that is never going to happen again.

Occupied City (2023) - IMDb,7.0,Melanie Hyams,Steve McQueen,Bianca Stigter,"The past collides with the present in this excavation of the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam: a journey from World War II to recent years of pandemic and protest and a provocative, life-affirming reflection on memory, time and what's to come."," A monumental undertaking: Occupied City is a very odd documentary, comprised of very distinct images and texts.The images are all of Amsterdam between 2020 and 2023, featuring daily life on the streets: the canals, houses, traffic, people. There are the summers with people lying in the parks and winters with ice skating on the canals. Throughout the film you can see the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, like a big demonstration against governmental measures against the spread of the virus, but also demonstrations against systemic racism, against climate change, remembrance days like May 4th and Keti Koti, the opening of the Holocaust Names Monument, the arrival of the first Ukrainian refugees and also celebrations like King's Day and the arrival of Saint Nicholas. Lastly there are images of - and sometimes inside - buildings and other places that are connected to stories of the second world war and the Nazi occupation. It's a beautifully shot ""day in the life"" documentary if you just watch the images.The texts (in Dutch voiced by actrice Carice van Houten or in the English version by Melanie Hyams) is comprised of snippets from the book ""Atlas of an Occupied City"" written by historian Bianca Stigter, who is also McQueen's wife. Dozens, if not hundreds of little stories connected to an address. Of jews hiding from the Nazis, of resistance against occupation and collaboration with the occupiers.Sometimes the text complements the images very well, especially when they film from inside the buildings from the stories. Watching people living their lives at places with such a rich and horrific history is sobering. Sometimes (especially after an hour or 3) you find yourself just watching the images, because it's very hard to concentrate on both the image and text at the same time. Just watching the film can be very meditative at times, until you catch another ""...and then they were executed in a concentration camp in 1944...."" and you realize what you are watching. There are so many stories, dates, names, deaths, that it's almost numbing.I've lived in Amsterdam for a long time and I recognize a lot of places and all of the events in the film. I've lived in places that had connections to the war, and I've always been conscious of events that took place at places that I know. I was even watching the film in the ""City"" theater that is featured in the film. So for me it was almost a pleasantly recognizable (if also a very very very very long) watch. To be honest, if you already know many of the things that happened during the war, it's not even that confronting anymore; it's simply the sheer volume of the stories that is overwhelming. I think the absence of interviews and explanations of the images will be confusing to those who don't know the city and don't know what's going on on screen.All in all, it's a monumental undertaking: years of filming, dozens of stories, 4 hour watch time, to try and connect the stories of occupied Amsterdam to those places in the present. It's a piece of art more than a documentary. I would recommend it especially for people who already have a connection with Amsterdam, who either live there or have a particular interest.~kruiwagen2000 rated 8/10 on 3 December 2023",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023) - IMDb,6.7,Trevor Noah|Neil Diamond,David Paul Meyer,Trevor Noah,"Trevor Noah recounts his amusing travels around the world, from foreign national anthems to different cultural norms."," Felt like Trevor on a normal day, not his best day.: I haven't seen a special of his in a while so I was excited when I saw this. It wasn't as densely packed with jokes, felt more like a Dave Chappelle thing where he's slowly telling the story, peeling away. And doing so in an insightful way, resulting in applause and not exactly laughs. It's intelligent, and eventually does get some laughs; But sometimes I just wanna hear dumb jokes, you know. I wish he said ""that flag, deez nuts"" for instance. There's his usual accent bits which he's good at. The special is okay it didn't really have any jokes that hit it out the park, felt like people applauded louder than when they did laugh.Still get a couple laughs, but not his best work per se. One thing though is Trevor is the only stand up comedian I'm okay with watching with my parentsHe doesn't say anything outrageous or edgy, plus he's a comedian well known throughout Africa who made it big so I think we're all sentimental and proud about it because he's actually good at it too. Something to be proud of. But this didn't feel as memorable as his other works, just decent.~AfricanBro rated 6/10 on 20 December 2023"," post the daily show: From detroit michigan, after hosting the daily show for so long. That must have been difficult to give up. A sixty eight minute standup special on netflix. He touches briefly on the dark history of germany. The history of columbus day in the united states. The use of public bathrooms.. by anyone! Gay marriage. Star wars. Germany and its new national anthem. Funny stuff. Cheerleaders and their past dating life. Lost luggage, and being left behind by his mother. Shopping in paris. And why there are so many tornados in the midwest. Trevor's history, and how he came to be where he is now. It's pretty funny! Directed by david meyer, also a long timer at the daily show.~ksf-2 rated 7/10 on 22 December 2023"," Good, Clean Fun: Yes, its not over the top hilarious and Trevor Noah took his time to tell the first joke but it was enjoyable.Its not your typical cuss words, swearing, Eff this, Eff that stand up routine... Its an intellectual and well-written show which you can enjoy with the whole family.Also, if you are familiar with Trevor Noah's work - he always has the political, national theme to his work even before The Daily Show.It is clean, well-written with some hard hitting facts which honestly comedian deliver way better than any of the politicians or people claiming to be on the ""right"" side of the things and an hour well spent.~elixirr rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," It's still Trevor Noah, but without the insightfulness: I'm a huge fan of Trevor Noah and any of his Standup programs are a must-watch for me. But as this one went on, I kept asking myself more and more if he had always been this obsessed with low-bar ""us and them"" jokes. Yeah, he always had the occasional funny stereotype, but in this one, he seems to be playing to the lowest common denominator.Case in point - I don't recall Trevor using this many ""guy, that's how women are, right?"" and ""ladies, that's how men are, right?"" bits in his shows. It's lowest-common-denominator humor creeping into a show that has all the world-aware potential to be much more.As someone who has read his autobiography ""Born a Crime"", I also can't help but raise an eyebrow at his anecdotes of his youth. Now, don't get me wrong - a stand-up comedian has to embellish, that's his job. But it seems that Trevor has stripped every little bit of his South African childhood from his routine, not even acknowledging it and instead trying his hardest to make everything relatable to the American reality. There's nothing to learn here, only a somewhat tired filed-down, safe bit.Speaking of embellishment, there are also outright incorrect statements here. Trevor is a Comedian who usually helps you learn stuff. He tends to talk about other countries in a way that's funny, but also educational. In this show, he outright mistranslates the German national anthem (because the actual translation wouldn't be a good punchline) along with several other factual misses. This puzzled me - I've never been aware of seeing him do that.Ultimately, I feel confident still giving five stars based on Trevor's personality and the wit that sometimes shines through. It's entertaining enough, but I found this special extremely disappointing. From beginning to end, it feels like Trevor is running down a safe routine for an American audience that's not aware of his work so far. As a fan, I hope that this doesn't herald a new approach to his material.~monsterfurby rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023"," What a waste of my time!: I used to like his comedy, but I think he's lost his mojo now.First 11 minutes of the show, he couldn't even get a chuckle out of me.

If you have liked his comedy before, I guarantee you wont like this one. Not at least the first 16 minutes, I couldn't afford to waste more time of my life on this crap.People in the theatre are probably laughing because they've paid for the tickets and have no other bloody option but to laugh at nothing at all. Looking at an ant losing its way and bumping into a wall would have gotten more laughter from me than what Trevor presented here.~happybuddha-96742 rated 1/10 on 22 December 2023"," Not earth-shattering, but comfortable and very funny.: Firstly, I miss Trevor so very much. Quick-witted and brilliant and more worldly than people three times his age. ""Where Was I"", was less stand-up and more of story telling experience; perhaps, a little TED-talky. I laughed a lot and loved his affable silliness; his impressions are world-class. He did kept it pretty light and could have elaborated a bit more on a few issues where I felt he skirted them a bit. I won't give anything away; you'll have to be the judge. Nothing earth shattering was introduced which is a bit unusually for Trevor. He is the rare comedian with the chops and the intelligence to pull off ""Earth-Shattering"". But... if I'm honest... I don't always want my earth shattered by a comedian. (BTW... if you haven't read Born a Crime... you should. ;-)~kelsy-97379 rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Hilarious!: Trevor's Netflix specials are always a treat, but this one really stands out. It's packed with moments that will make you laugh out loud, and his storytelling skills shine, particularly the anecdotes about his trip to Paris. The rendition of the national anthem was a stroke of comedic brilliance. Trevor's take on cultural observations, especially his insights on 'white man confidence' and his 'Sweet Caroline' bit, is both relatable and hilarious, without ever crossing into discomfort. It's a heartwarming special, filled with amusing stories, perfect for lifting spirits just in time for the holiday season.~larkb rated 10/10 on 20 December 2023"," Meh.: This is perhaps an unpopular opinion.. and maybe it's just me but unlike Russel Peters and many others, Trevor Noah always comes across as someone who's trying TOO hard. From his forced laughs and scripted jokes, the guy just doesn't seem like a natural at stand up. 'Where was I' reinforces this belief of mine like nothing before. The overall show lacks spontaneity or any special moment that would make one really sit up and notice. The overall feel is that it tries to be too smart for itself. All in all, you're not really missing out much if you decide to not watch it.Don't take me wrong. This isn't bad or a complete waste of time but it certainly isn't anything special that you'd remember for any reasonable amount of time.~osmanakhairi rated 1/10 on 21 December 2023"," Tough to Watch, Even for Trevor Noah: I've tried to give him a chance multiple times over the years and I really wanted to like him, but ultimately, Trevor Noah just isn't great at stand-up. The guy just isn't funny.From his timing, to his topics, to the material itself, he just falls flat. I chuckled absentmindedly once or twice during this special, but otherwise, it more or less just amounted to me rolling my eyes for an hour.Again, he's never been funny, but this is really his worst showing that I've seen. It's really too bad. I was hoping for something better from him post-Daily Show, but this will likely be the last of my time I invest in him.~tmitchell-52264 rated 2/10 on 1 January 2024"," Right here, right now: No pun intended - I mean the title of his show already is a pun, so what could I add? Well I reckon I found something to add. That aside let's get into Trevor himself. I had a bit of an issue with him when I ""discovered"" him. That's quite a stretch actually - he took over the Daily Show, he already was doing shows and stuff. But he was replacing Jon Stewart ... how could he? How could anyone? But whoever was responsible for that decision ... I salute you! I reckon it was more than one person who made this possible.After a bit of time to warm up to him, I could see the differences ... and relish in them and enjoy them. I may still have some issues or disagree here and there, but that is more than normal ... no one human is the same as the other. And yet he is probably one of the most decent comedics out there. So you will not find too many things that will offend the same way that Ricky Gervais offends with ... Trevor is not that kind of comedian! Take it or leave it one might say.And I reckon he may talk way too much about Germany and France for Americans ... but he tries to bring some outside perspective to the US ... you have to applaud that. And while I don't think all the points he is making are 100% right, it is interesting to see him expanding and really maturing and becoming more knowledgeable! He knows: you always can learn more! And he does just do that.And he tries to ""teach"" us too. Not in a bad way - or in the sense of ""I know more than you"". No it never comes of as demeaning. One thing is for sure: no matter where he goes - he will never be lost! (yes I just did that - with his help)~kosmasp rated 9/10 on 30 December 2023"

This man STILL believes he is free of any wrong doing, that he is this jovial, sweet man that couldn't possibly hurt a fly... He makes me sick! Furious!I also really have such anger towards his wife and even their daughter who allowed this man to abuse one of her own daughters.I am not negating or dismissing trauma and the cycle of dysfunction that does essentially brain wash a victims emotional or moral compass, but since the DAWN OF TIME a mother is designed to protect their children, not continously put them in the jaws of the lion. I don't care what year it was or what societal stigmas were in place, nothing should hinder that instinct.Also. That other weird, overly defensive, overly chatting couple that completely gas light her Mother and immediate began to preach the word of God and make her pray for forgiveness... UNREAL!!! I was floored either of them even entertained that whole thing, that couple was shady and clearly hiding something too...This guy is a monster, stone cold and has lived his whole live raping little girls with no repercussions, this is exponentially terrible and shameful.This took so much courage from her and especially all of the victims, very well done.~shailosweetkittycat rated 10/10 on 8 December 2023"," Hard-hitting and devastating on many levels: As ""Great Photo, Lively Life"" (2023 release; 112 min.) opens, we are with Amanda and her mom Debbie, who are visiting Amanda's grandpa (Debbie's dad) in Florida, ready to finally confront him over the sexual abuses of many young girls all this years ago. He doesn't deny any of it, and in fact goes one further. We then go back in time to the 1970s in Bradford, PA, where he worked as a chiropractor. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this movie is co-directed by Rachel Beth Anderson (""Unschooled"") and Amanda Mustard, making her directing debut. The movie is a hard-hitting, if not shocking, but certainly devastating look back to the speechless acts of sexual abuse over many years by her grandfather, and the long-term consequences for the family and the victims. The grandfather shows no signs of remorse, zero, and explains it all like you would explain buying a loaf of bread at the grocery store, To Amanda's immense credit, she does not shy away from the difficult moments, and plows on to get to the bottom of this, including the responsibilities of the people around her grandfather, including i=his wife and yes, Amanda's mother. Please note that this will make many viewers uncomfortable, as surely I was.""Great Photo, Lovely Life"" premiered at SXSW earlier this year to immediate critical acclaim. It started airing on HBO 2 weeks ago and it is also streaming on Max, where I caught it. If you want to understand the truly devastating effects of a serial pedophile on his victims, his family, and society as a while, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.~paul-allaer rated 8/10 on 19 December 2023"," Impacts So Many People Suffering in Silence: Was glued to the TV watching this documentary. It's the first time I have watched a show about family members abusing other family members. It's a discussion that usually doesn't happen in families. These ladies faced it in their family head on. Because of the time lapse of the abuse, memories, in some instances, were from so many years ago but very vivid. The bravery of the ladies to dig deep is admirable. The Grandfather, in my opinion, didn't grasp the severity of what his actions did to the people he abused. His words rang hollow to me. Granted he was close to dying but, his words centered more on how he is going to be greeted upon his death. Recently, I learned my Father tried to abuse his Granddaughters when they were preteens. His actions repulsed me. He has been gone for many years but he was never confronted. Thank you for sharing your experience. I admire you for doing this in a public setting. Hopefully it will start discussion's in families that are currently dealing with this issue.~Susansgoldens rated 10/10 on 7 December 2023"," Perfect Portrayal of Disassociation: I'm floored, disturbed, angry, and in utter dismay after seeing this. The bravery needed to tell this story must have been insurmountable. Endless gratitude to Amanda for doing this work and to her sister, mother, and all her grandfather's victims for surviving it.The unending forgiveness and gifts of contact & affection, even still calling him ""Grampa"" instead of just ""Bill"" left me disgusted. It was a reminder at how skewed religion can make us in regard to the forgiveness aspect.But I have no theory on the contact and affection. Only resentment. I'm sure it must have been difficult and complicated, but it made me angry that he got to experience the joy and love of having his family in his life when he clearly didn't deserve to.Everyone should see this film, especially if you live with ""a secret you shouldn't have to keep"".~shayleonia rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," Powerful: This is such a powerful documentary. It is so brave to take on this topic, let alone with the abuser and other victims and especially the fact that most are family.My mother grew up with her brothers being her abusers. There were some allegations her father was the same way, but he died when she was three years old. She was a daddy's girl and was so lost when he passed and there was no comfort from family. Then, to only be abused in her house knowing her mother had to be aware of what was going on. For Amanda and Angie to have the clarity to realize the Debi and Angie experienced very similar things is tremendous. I was never abused (that I can recall), but my brother has mentioned one occasion and he doesn't remember which uncle. My mom prides herself on keeping us safe around them and never alone. It would destroy her to know that she failed, and I will never tell her because of that.My mother developed borderline personality disorder due to all that she suffered. I see this in Debi. My mom is still the three year old that lost her dad and the not much older little girl that was abused. Her emotions are of a child. She easily gets very hurt and offended and feels ultimately rejected if she feels anything perceived as an attack. It's that little girl hurt and lashing out. People with BPD also push others away during times like this. Amanda handled Debi so well. I see so many other children of women with BPD not wanting to understand the reasons behind their actions and words. When you break a child and there is no attempt at healing that child until well into adulthood, I don't think they are ever healed completely.My heart breaks for Angie. Not only for what she suffered at the hands of her grandfather, but also that It will always be difficult for Debi to accept where she failed. This will be a lifelong navigation, but from what I have seen Amanda and Angie are pushing forward by leaps and bounds. Their children will be better for it.I am so proud of you all.~couldbefbi rated 10/10 on 7 December 2023"," Stunning and nuanced: This is without a doubt one of the strongest and most self-aware documentaries I have ever seen. Beautiful visuals and nuanced delivery. It feels like I'm experiencing someone's memories firsthand.The film rings so true to family dysfunction - and the complex ways that the human mind processes that dysfunction in order to protect ourselves. It tracks many years in the life of the family, so we see through the camerawoman's eyes how family dynamics play out both short-term and long-term. It's honest and heartfelt.So many documentaries go overboard with exposition and oversimplify trauma. This one doesn't. Highly recommend.~wkbhss rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," A truly strong family: In spite of this person being an absolute, unremorsful monster, his family showed him the compassion and love he didn't deserve and never showed to his countless victims. I certainly wouldn't have been so kind in this situation.As someone from a family with the patriarch also doing such things, this family's ability to confront his actions head on makes me sad my family never could speak openly about what had happened. Quite the opposite, this was buried deep down and became a shameful secret only part of the family even knows about today.My expectation is that everybody who watched this documentary or is reading this review has experience to some degree, either personally, or with a loved one some form of sexual abuse. It is staggering and disgusting how pervasive these behaviors are but if we are ever going to slow its momentum it's by being upfront and honest and teaching our children to speak up.Powerful and jarring movie.~waggs-ny rated 9/10 on 16 December 2023"," Realistic dysfunctional family doc: I felt that the doc portrays exactly how thousands of dysfynctional families get through lifetimes of abuse. Trying to keep secrets that just end up destroying them from the inside and sadly repeating generations. Secrets are an abusers best weapon. I noticed religion placing forgiveness as more important than holding perps accountable seemed to really stunt healing for some here. Many people use that way of dealing with hardship. To place it all in God's hands to deal with..but I say that gives the secrets more power and perps the privilege to continue on their merry way without confrontation. This film highlights how people can mix together(and confuse) the true love and trust children have for a parent (grandparents) with the ill-willed abusers demands for ""love"", respect. Sexual abuse, secrets and then abuser gaslighting were the main dysfunctional features for this family. I felt we peeked over their wall of secrets and gained some useful insight. I applaud her for shining light into a very dark corner. Was she therapeutic? She tried- but not really. She was realistic and raw. I'm actually shocked she was so brave and vocal- considering the women of her family being so sheepish and controlled. Was there a perfect ""accountability bow"" on the whole package in the end?... no. She did try, but such is life...messy without the big happy ending sometimes. And it's OK to not be OK. There WAS progress for healing in some and discussion for our awareness and for that- An Absolute Triumph. *Unhide secrets. Talk!! Hold abusers accountable. *~daniray2005 rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," This is not a documentary..: ..this is a gross representation of a family secret. The ""filmmaker"" is so self-involved that she has no idea or care for how she is re-traumatizing these victims. As a therapist, and a survivor for sex assault myself, I am actually livid at how cavalier this woman is digging up everyone else's past. In one of the final scenes, she seemingly begs her own mother to be angry about HER OWN trauma; I was in disbelief. This is not how to process generational trauma, particularly when it was someone else's experience.Besides the true exploitation of the victims, this is a very poorly made documentary. The story peaks within the first few minutes, and the following 90 minutes are just the filmmakers own version of non-consent (impeding on victims life's with absolutely no care). Using victims for her own gain, and somehow without an ounce of compelling storytelling. Please watch Rewind instead- another documentary about a families generational sexual abuse, coincidentally also in the suburbs of PA, and actually well told and healing.~cpcarpitella rated 1/10 on 7 December 2023", self serving: I found this to be nothing more than a self serving documentary. Giving this evil predator any sort of sympathy throughout the documentary must have been heartbreaking to the actual victims. Saying your conflicted about this evil man and his evil deeds is insulting to the victims. Treating him like he was anything was not helping or healing anyone. I've read that this was no way to try and help victims of sexual abuse because it felt to me like they were actually just trying to get past it and silence would be the best thing to do. Explaining that the grandmother never said anything and kept her silence was another insulting part...everyone was at fault and no one takes any responsibility from the grandparents to the parent...they all knew and did nothing.~rdmceagles rated 1/10 on 10 December 2023

However, Macchiarini was still coasting on the glowing publicity that followed their initial surgeries, leaving two of his colleagues at prestigious Karolinska Institute to deal with the carnage of his dubious treatment. Together they wrote a damning report exposing Macchiarini's falsified research. Perhaps predictably, the Karolinska administers turned on the whistleblowers rather than its cash cow.Meanwhile, Italian doctor started to have an affair which undoubtedly caused to shadow his reputation , as the journalist lover got suspicious of his pre-marriage promises.

Take Care of Maya (2023) - IMDb,7.8,Paolo Macchiarini,John Pappas,,"As a medical team tries to understand 10-year-old Maya Kowalski's rare illness, they begin to question her parents. Suddenly, Maya is in state custody - despite a family desperate to bring their daughter home."," Sad Commentary on the Medical System: I'll try to hold onto the belief that everyone in this scenario had the best interests of children at the heart in their positions. I'll try, although there's a huge conflict of interest issue that I'd like to see a second documentary tackle all in itself.(The assessor also being part of the for-profit corporate care system that the referred children go into.)But lets say that the care givers are there still to ""do no harm"" and were wanting the best for Maya. This documentary still poses the problem of what to do for ""unicorn"" illnesses. What to do when doctors from different establishments differ on diagnosis and treatment. Who gets to decide when there's not a widely established protocol?And mainly, who gets the final decisions when it comes to health.I'm not sure whose diagnosis and treatment are better, frankly, and will have to read more. Perhaps on that it was a toss up or even that the hospital involved was right.However, when a hospital thinks parents seeking treatment for a child are wrong for following a doctors orders, there I can see what everyone else here is seeing. How would a mother or father know which doctor to trust? And why would they believe this group at the hospital when they've seen actual improvement before this that no one else got?There had to be a better way to handle this.There had to be a more HUMANE way to handle this.There should be a less corporate, systemic way to handle this.But unfortunately for some, the system overrules the carers and a few bad apples playing into that spoil it for the bunch.~Sarah423 rated 8/10 on 25 June 2023"," Heart-wrenching: Heavy and infuriating documentary, but very much worth watching.Beata fought a David vs. Goliath battle all on her own, against three deeply corrupt systems all working together: the 'healthcare' cartel, er, system, social 'services', and the judicial system. She persevered and stood stronger than the overwhelming majority of people would in such a situation. Had her husband supported and fought alongside her, instead of subduing and criticizing her valiant efforts, I do believe the outcome for this family would have been very different.Good on Maya for surviving through the ordeals these awful systems put her through, and for calling her three-month 'hospital stay' what it was - medical captivity. She is smart to steer completely clear of the medical cabal now, and I hope viewers learn the priceless lesson that our utterly broken, incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving 'healthcare' system cannot be trusted with your health and your life.The utter AUDACITY of Johns Hopkins to bill Maya's insurance for obscene amounts under false billing codes, on top of the terrorism they were inflicting upon this family is blood-boiling. How is no one in prison over this?!?! Oh that's right, because these systems protect their own, and each other.The cowardly statements issued by Johns Hopkins and that horrible judge at the end are disgraceful. Zero remorse or accountability for the devastation they inflicted upon this family. And as the documentary shows, this is hardly an isolated case. Who knows how many other families have been wrecked by the trio of social 'services', 'healthcare' systems, and the judicial system when they decide to destroy parents' lives based on little or no evidence. Or simply as punishment for daring to question the all-knowing (not) megalomaniac doctors.Infuriating. I hope the family wins huge at trial, but if there were true justice, everyone who played a part in this awful situation would be behind bars.~DarknessVisible20 rated 10/10 on 20 June 2023"," Bound to get under your skin, if not infuriate you: As ""Take Care of Maya"" (2023 release; 103 min.) opens, It's ""February 24, 2021"" as we are introduced to a guy named Jack. He muses ""There is nothing that could prepare me for what I went through."" We then go back in time: Jack remembers meeting Beata, and eventually they have 2 kids, a girl and a boy. The girl, Maya, suffers from a strange illness when she is 9... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Henry Roosevelt (""Tough Guys""). Here he examines the phenomenon currently referred to as medical child abuse (a/k/a Munchausen's by proxy). Jack and Beata bring Maya to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children's, and next thing we know the hospital calls in Children Protective Services, and things only get worse from there.. I mean, you have to see it for yourself because otherwise you won't believe it. (The fact that Florida outsources its privatized child welfare service to a third party should be an INSTANT red flag, but hey that's Florida for ya.) The results are as predictable as they are preventable. Families shredded apart? No worries. Lives destroyed? Who cares. I honestly don't know how some of these people can sleep at night. This documentary is bound to get under your skin, if not outright infuriate you. Don't say I didn't warn you!""Take Care of Maya"" premiered recently at the Tribeca, to immediate critical acclaim. There is good reason why this documentary is rated 91% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. It started airing on Netflix a few days ago, which is where I saw it.

I live in Australia and had not heard about this case.Wow... to say I was furious by the end is an understatement. I understand that the safety of a child is always paramount but the hospital and doctors not taking responsibility for their part in what happened is disgusting. I don't know how they sleep at night.I feel terrible for the Kowalski family and any family that has had to deal with what is obviously a flawed system.As a race we have come so far, but as human beings we lack the compassion necessary to elevate ourselves to the next level. The society we have created is now out of control and it seems that money and power are our driver.~Shelpa rated 10/10 on 19 June 2023"," Made me hug my kids: I watched this late Tuesday night while my 2 daughters, 12 and 4, were asleep and while hearing the moms voice frustrated trying to talk to her daughter on the phone alone at the hospital just made my heart ache. I just hugged and kissed both my girls imagining her pain. If the mom had been the ""calm"" one (for lack of a better word) then the dad would've been the one freaking out. But because she took the reins of trying to fight for her child, they made it look like she was the bad abusive parent. And how they tried to turn dad against her!!! Ugh I was disgusted. Just dr sally smiths face alone with her angry eyebrows during her interviewing just gave me the picture in my mind of what she was like in her position at work: total power trip POS. Did this story surprise me? Nope. I can totally see it. Doctors who think they know better than parents is such an old story. I went thru such a horrible traumatizing experience with my oldest daughter when she was born that dealt with idiot drs not listening to moms intuition. My baby had pneumonia and when I took her into the ER I swear the guy gaslit me as a ""young new mom who was paranoid."" I took my baby home and that night she stopped breathing, was dying, rushed her back and her oxygen was at 60%. I was literally JUST THERE THAT day and they sent me home! My baby almost died but thankfully recovered in the ICU miraculously (3 week old preemie with pneumonia) so yeah it was crazy. I just got depressed at the hospital watching my baby hoping for her to get better. I kept thinking of that day I took her in saying something wasn't right, she was lethargic, not eating, etc. And I was sent home. Obviously compared to this, my story is less traumatizing. I mean just imagining this story alone gave me anxiety so I have no idea how this family copes thru it all. And all of it because of some power trippy dr?! She thinks she's saving children left and right from abusive homes when SHE is the one causing pain and distress in a family...man, someone has to set that woman straight! I hope she gets what she deserves. Poor Mayas mom knew the only way her daughter could go home free was if she was gone. Wow just so sad. So so sad.~sinahaase-960-743497 rated 9/10 on 20 June 2023"," Overwhelming mix bag of emotions: Wow. Watching this I felt a cocktail of emotions all at once! Anger, sadness, disbeleif, disgust, empathy and love.Before I continue with my contribution I have to mention the elephant in the room: one of the contributions on this page. Now everyone is indeed entitled to their opinion but the amount of unfounded crap this particular contributor spewed out was plainly nonesencical!Anyway, this was the story of an ordinary upper middle class family that needlessly ended in a tragedy. Like other contributors I watched in disbeleif how the system could easily do whatever it wanted and in this case even drive someone to suicide.Jack and Beata were a happy couple with two beautiful children. Without going through the whole synopsis, I must say that sadly I believe Jack did not do enough to calm Beata and be the rock of the family. To me it seemed he was like a headless chicken running around in circles while Beata did everything in her power to get their daughter back.Thank God that she documented everything, from phone conversations to emails etc. As the lawsuit lawyers said because of that their evidence for the case is compelling.But on a final note, it is wrong to blame Jack for the events. He was and still is a loving father.I am glad they finally got what they wanted, a trial which is set to begin on 11 September this year. My prayers are with the family.~haroot_azarian rated 10/10 on 20 June 2023"," Heartbreaking case of systemic abuse of power: As a social worker in the UK I can understand why there would be concern over a young child having large and Frequent doses of Ketamine but this decision did not stem from the mother, Ketamine was prescribed by a Doctor!

As our citizenry becomes more and more dependent on the vast systems our government has developed people can and are being victimized by a the very institutions that are supposed to protect them. This documentary is one example of how off the tracks our institutions can go. Maya's family has not received Justice nor have the other families who suffered the same fate. The physicians, hospitals, government agency workers, attorneys and judges who collaborated to destroy these families will someday meet their maker and have to explain themselves. I'd also add that Maya's mother was an immigrant from one of the most oppressive regimes the world ever knew and she jumped out of the fire and into the frying pan by moving to America when she did. During another era she probably would have been proud of her decision.

On a matter that you couldn't possibly be wrong about (your body, validated by your mother, a licensed nurse, 2 self sought specialists and a 3rd specialist)? That = Maya's and Beata's experience (You will appreciate why I've left out one key family member after you've watched the documentary.). This was aggravated particularly because she was a child when this took the worst turn, and was thoroughly dismissed in all possible directions by her JHACH doctors.This documentary carries tremendous tragedy for the entire Kowalski family, and an incredible wounding of the soul, and I'm doing my best not to give any spoilers, but please, please, if you can, watch it.Spread the message, sign any available petitions you can, because you'll come to find a destructive, unsubstantiated baseless pattern of 'probable' cause by one key individual. It is that pattern that needs to be evaluated, and changes made to a policy/manner of doing things that has destroyed hundreds/thousands of lives.Maya, Kyle, I am with you <3.~jacklynebetty rated 10/10 on 19 June 2023"

Unlike your usual Hollywood Biopic, Still is an inspiring story of young, and perhaps somewhat superficial, movie star journey from celebrity to hero.The creative presentation shows the present-day disabled Fox struggling with the consequences of Parkinson's Disease and uses that as a jumping off point for his telling the story of how we went from struggling actor to mega Hollywood star. Then it journeys through his diagnosis with Parkinson's which he initially hid from the public as well as his struggle with alcoholism. Eventually, it shows the evolution of his role as he emerges as inspiration to millions who struggle with Parkinson's and many other disorders. His extraordinary fundraising efforts are a celebration of the human spirit. His dignity and decency in the face of an incurable disease are truly inspiring.The creative format of Guggenheim's film is fascinating, because he uses a mix of clips from Fox's TV and movies along with a series of recreations framed by modern day interviews to tell Fox's story. It is told with great humor and grace.For anyone of a certain age, Michael J. Fox was a cultural icon. Back to the Future is one of the iconic cultural markers of the 1980s. And Still really is in and of itself, appropriately enough, a journey back in time. In a time where we seem to lack heroes, Michael J. Fox is one and this film provides a great tribute to him.~JustCuriosity rated 10/10 on 15 March 2023"," Very moving doc about the ravages of Parkinsons Disease on a Stoic Michael J Fox.: You probably know Michael J Fox is Canadian, made Back to the Future and has Parkinson's disease.What you might not know is how resilient, brave, funny and charming he is.What you probably don't know is he falls over a lot and walks like Billy Connolly doing the Glaswegian drunk man impersonation.In this documentary that is brilliantly directed by Davis Guggenheim there are two stars.Michael J Fox who narrates the movie, to camera, with his mangled voice often quite difficult to comprehend and Michael Harte, the editor.It's a piece of magical illusion because somehow the directing/editing team have managed to piece together snippets of Fox's work to sit alongside Fox himself in 'telling the story'. It has echoes of my all time favourite documentary, 102 minutes that Changed America, in that it's essentially 'found footage that's used to tell the story. It's remarkable.But at its core is the sad (not sad) sight of Michael J Fox, that lovable little scamp, at 61 looking like a wreck, but still, somehow defying the hideous encroachment of Parkinsons with dignity and humour.It's very moving and it's very great.~markgorman rated 9/10 on 15 May 2023"," Informative and entertaining bio of a superstar's charm and strength.: From his hit series ""Family Ties"" through the iconic Back to the Future and beyond, the 80's diminutive Michael J. Fox has been an impish cultural giant. With the onset of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1991 and revealed in 1998, he has been known as a fearless fighter, along with other famous sufferers such as Mohammed Ali and Kathryn Hepburn.An informative new documentary Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, streaming on Apple TV+, is a blend of original footage showing his meteoric rise to fame and subtle re-enactment. In all, it shows his charm and his determination to expose the disease to needed research by campaigning for funding.Director David Guggenheim and editor Michael Harte have seamlessly spliced publicity B-roll, videos, stock footage and a few narrators to create a convincing bio about Michael's rise and fall and permanent rise again to national recognition. This doc is as much a powerful testimony to the threat of Parkinson's as it is a testament to the will power of a former super star to fight it.Because Fox is eminently watchable even under the sway of the disease, this doc is entertaining and informative. He asks for no pity but gains enormous respect for facing reality and fighting for happiness.~JohnDeSando rated NA on 13 May 2023"," And I'm crying with Cancer! Huge RESPECT!: I've Always loved Michael J Fox for a few reasons... First he's a Fighter, always has been, He's also the guy who against All Odds believed enough to keep going...THIS this documentary Proves that and more. Recalling Family Ties and him meeting his future wife Tracey, she is the equivalent of a perfect match...this man brings joy no matter what he does no matter how he feels that is the constant from before Parkinson's and with Parkinson's. His ability to speak the raw truth and Embrace all sides of his life as the Eye opening example of the conflict of an individual who at a Very young age and on top of his game, Michael J Fox Faced Parkinson's starring it head on, not missing a beat! This young man is a true testament to love, gratitude, appreciation, family, hope, faith, resilience, and Truth! I myself have Cancer, unlike Michael I'm all alone, yet doing all I can within my circumstances... truth is, he will outlive me, and Good for him he deserves that and more! With a beautiful family this life has blessed him with, and the Integrity that he exhibits in speaking for many who have this obstacle in their life that can be debilitating - Yet Michael continues to Shine Throughout the Darkness, Embracing it and being that beacon of hope, faith, light, that we All should honor and I'm grateful to him and thankful not only for his talent and perseverance, but the Character that he is kind enough to continue to offer this world! I must say his wife is nothing but pure love and this family is blessed, blessed to uphold and embrace gracefully e the challenges that life brings... Thank you Michael, you are a Hero to Many!~rjccmb rated 10/10 on 13 May 2023"," Another brilliant documentary from Davis Guggenheim: Michael J. Fox agreed to make a documentary about his life, career and of course, his battle with Parkinson Disease. As the physician who diagnoses him says, ""it's a battle that you won't win."" But I get the feeling he insisted this would and should be as unsentimental as possible; none of that ""oh woe is me"" crap that drives people to resent rich, successful celebrities struggling with that same real-life crap that we all have to. Michael's angelic wife, Tracy Pollan (who upon learning of his diagnosis, whispers ""in sickness and in health"" ... {sniffles} God Bless Her!) and equally devoted children are clearly his primary reasons for living. But after 10 years of (mostly) silent suffering, he discovered another reason: going public with his incurable condition has increased awareness of it greatly and been a literal, welcome and much-needed $2 billion boon to the funding of research into the disease. I'll admit I was surprised that the punk kid on Family Ties (older than he looked, it turned out) also turned out to be a genuinely good actor. But I was even more surprised and delighted to see him ultimately turn out to be an even better human being. I feel lucky to have lived during the extremely noteworthy life and times of the Canadian actor, wellness activist/philanthropist and man truly with a mission, Michael J. Fox. He is ""da man""!!! I rate this a strong 9 of 10 stars.~dfloro rated 9/10 on 13 May 2023"," Genuine & Inspirational Look at Michael J. Fox's Career And Parkinson's Battle: It's easy to look at Michael J. Fox's career through the prism of pity: once on top of Tinseltown during his Family Ties-Back to the Future-Teen Wolf run, a young diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease curtailed his acting career and made each day now an uphill battle. But of course, MJF has to live that existence--and to him it is simply an everyday occurrence to keep surviving for and with his family. Others may feel sorry for him--but he certainly does not take that attitude for himself and it shows in ""Still"".For a very basic overview, ""Still"" director Davis Guggenheim does two things simultaneously:First, he looks back on the incredible shooting star ascent that was Fox's career--from a no-name kid in Canada to an absolute takeover of the both the big and small screens in the 1980s. It wouldn't be unreasonable to call him the actor most synonymous with 80s pop culture.Interspersed with the bio material is how Fox currently battles his Parkinson's symptoms, such as the tremors that make walking difficult and cause him extreme pain without carefully mediated medication. Whether working with a speech therapist or a physical therapist, Fox must constantly learn and re-learn the bodily skills he once took for granted.Ironically, speaking to this doc's title, a man who was once a blur of perpetual motion would now do anything to gain some physical calm. Yet, he projects a remarkably positive, upbeat attitude about his current condition. In fact, one of his biggest obstacles is trying to walk too quickly and falling over! In other words, he still retains the youthful spirit that catapulted him to film/TV stardom.I think the hallmark of ""Still"", however, are the clips of MJF interacting with his family. Most who will be interested in ""Still"" already know the backstory, but seeing him laugh and joke with wife Tracy Pollan and their children is a window into his life that will make you smile and bring a tear to your eye.Overall, I really enjoyed ""Still"" and my only slight critique is that the ending was a bit abrupt--I actually wanted more modern-day MJF material! But as it stands, this is a really inspirational doc that shows the courageous, optimistic spirit of Michael J. Fox in the face of seemingly overwhelming adversity.~zkonedog rated 9/10 on 15 May 2023"," Heartfelt and Very Worthwhile: Highly recommended. Michael J Fox is authentic and vulnerable in reflecting upon his successes as an actor, as well as his challenges with Parkinson's. He is fortunate to be surrounded by a loving, buoyant family who does not feel sorry for him. Like him, they retain their playful sense of humor, and it's clear that the Fox family has a good time being together. This film is edited effectively, and the director wisely made a choice in how the younger Michael would be portrayed in a handful of scenes. The stand-in they have for him is filmed from the back, which lends credibility. Luckily, for all involved, there is so much actual footage of Michael, mostly from his TV roles, that the editor had a lot of material to work from. The Director is the off-camera interviewer, who asks pertinent questions, while wisely avoiding the trap of sentimentality. It's curious that the film does not spend too much time addressing Fox's outstanding foundation for Parkinson's, but perhaps that will be revealed in a future film. If you're like me, and have known people who have Parkinson's, there are moments of this film which will touch you, while offering new insights.~seemingly_reel rated NA on 13 May 2023"," still so charismatic: This is a documentary biography of Michael J. Fox. Director Davis Guggenheim has done plenty of directing and producing. His most noted work is probably 'An Inconvenient Truth'. For this one, he seems to be channeling Errol Morris.This movie can be divided into three aspects. There is the standard childhood and starving actor stage of his life. It's interesting to see his short stature since his early years and struggling to live on his last dime. Then there is his TV and movie footage pulled together to tell his story. It's great nostalgia for me. It also works really well to show the progression of his career and the disease. The footage makes it seem like a movie we're familiar with, but the story is somehow new.Finally, there is his present day interviews. He is still so charismatic although the disease has taken its toll. He shows his everyday struggles. Quite frankly, his is the same struggle that my elderly mother went through a few years earlier. I think a lot of the audience can see their family in his situation. It fills out my understanding of his disease and makes something human instead of simply academics. I grew up watching this guy. His humor is still here. More than ever, his dignity and humanity is on display.~SnoopyStyle rated 9/10 on 13 July 2023"," Nostalgic and Inspirational: Cleverly edited clips from Michael J. Fox's career, juxtaposed against new interviews and insights create a feeling of nostalgia and inspiration. The editing, the pace, and the revelations from Michael brought the crowd to laughter and tears.MJFox the man is greater than MJFox the amazing and talented actor I grew up with, as a kid watching Back to the Future and Teen Wolf. The most inspirational human and a phenomenal film. That's what I felt watching Davis Guggenheim's gem at Sundance. Major congratulations to Mr. Guggenheim, his editor, the entire team, and especially Michael J. Fox.I can't wait to watch it again.~johnjbudion-89927 rated 9/10 on 24 January 2023"," Wonderfully put together: What a wonderfully creative way to document and show your life so far.I enjoyed every minute of this. The use of old clips and new interviews clips to tell Michaels story was absolutely perfect. How he started his career to where he found out he had parkinson's to then revealing it to the world years later. It worked so well. Pacing was on point so you don't get bored watching it (even if you aren't a Michael J Fox fan). It was funny and moving (no pun intended) and really showed Michael as a person as well as getting a strong message across. No matter whats put in front of you or what issues you have, don't let it consume you and stop you from enjoying life.A must watch documentary film!!~burntoutboy rated 10/10 on 12 May 2023"

Despite different paths taken, they meet at the pinnacle of the free-diving world, experiencing the thrilling rewards and inescapable risks of chasing dreams through the depths of the ocean."," This documentary is a charade: DISCLAIMER: Until recently, I used to be a very active freediver, an occasional safety diver and instructor. I am familiar with the tragedy that happened at Dahab.I forgot why I really, REALLY dislike Alessia Zecchini. Actually, I can't stand her. My entire body sounds off major alarms I can only interpret as intuition: ""This woman is bad news!""This documentary reminded me why. She's a head-strong brat who was so reckless as a freediver that it was bound she'd get someone killed. That just happened to be her good friend/coach/boyfriend Stephen Keenan. And now she's made a poor man's guilt-trip documentary that wants to pay homage to the man who saved her life by sacrificing his, but still somehow winds up focusing mostly on her and her freediving journey.The VERY FIRST scene is Alessia having a blackout right before surfacing from a deep dive. As a fellow freediver, I was deeply appaled and offended by this directorial decision, because it would be like a documentary about Ferrari that opens with a major car crash.Blackouts are not as common a thing at freediving competitions as this documentary would lead you to believe. And especially underwater blackouts are something that should be avoided at all costs! Responsible, capable, and upstanding freedivers know where their limit is and prepare beforehand so they do NOT put themselves and their safety divers at unnecessary risk. Alessia Zecchini is NOT one of those freedivers. So if the documentary wanted to portray the potential dangers of competitive freediving, Alessia Zecchini is one of the last (if not THE LAST) freedivers to talk.The Vertical Blue competition where Alessia had 3 blackouts one after the other was one of the most irresponsible things I've ever seen a freediver do at a competition. Putting herself in danger is one thing, but being so selfish to put her own petty goals over the safety of the safety crew is disgraceful. And a reckless, truly dangerous decision done in the utmost poorest of taste.I don't think Alessia feels her share of the responsibility for Stephen's death. I didn't think she did after the accident happened and - after seeing this documentary - I still don't think she does. But I think she should.""The Deepest Breath"" is a disjointed documentary about competitive freediving à la Alessia Zecchini that tries to whitewash the fact that Alessia's approach to life was/perhaps still is to put herself and her ambitions first and disregard others. I'm truly sorry if I misjudged and miss-stepped, but I found way too many parts of ""The Deepest Breath"" a despickable, self-indulgent charade.4 stars because the documentary does want to head into the right direction, at times with surprising candor. But it falls way short.~Geekofriendly rated 4/10 on 27 July 2023"," Simply Profound in Everyway: Having halfway expecting a dry documentary about free diving, a much less interesting take on it than the old movie ""The Big Blue""; boy was I wrong.No spoilers, just if you watch it you will love every minute. The story, cinematography, the commentary, and the music weave together to pull you totally in. And for sure you will be sobbing at the end but the whole presentation has foreboding but beautiful mood so that doesn't count as a spoiler.For me however, I don't think I have every heard spoken a more precise and deep description of what loss is. This is spoken at the end of the movie by the father of one of the main characters. And it is nothing less than profound in its insightfulness and understanding about how human beings feel about loss. That is if you are smart enough to put it into words, and these words really moved me. I will always remember them.~d-papadakis rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," ""How can one person touch so many?"": I often find myself deeply fascinated by people's passions, at the same time it sometimes frightens me the idea of how the obsession with passion can possibly be the end of you literally and figuratively. What does it really take to go after your passion? And how willing are you to sacrifice for it?I watched this documentary without any knowledge of freediving or the story and it immediately grabbed my attention right from the opening scene, that itself kept me on the edgeIt's such an interesting element of the story structure how stunning they capture the concept to be as an extreme sport, yet how dangerous of an endeavor it actually is. It shows you both sides of the athlete's obsession about it and the lengths they go for it, which leaves you questioning wanting to understand the depths of satisfaction beyond passion given their lives are at dangerous risks knowingly.The cinematography was stunning, incredible archival footage! It takes you through the diver's journeys from top to underwater beautifully it's sometimes scary. The interviews were heartfelt and informative enough for you to understand a bit of the extreme sport, while at the same time, it maintained sensations and delivered emotionally making you feel for the tragedy and how their story intertwined in destiny.~kawtharffathalla rated 8/10 on 1 August 2023"," Stunning but a strong point underplayed: I watched this with feelings of awe, fear and that captivating feel you inly get from underwater cinematography.However.It missed the emphasis of the final message.A true act of limits and daring, for sure, but the emphasis of how dangerous Allessia is, to herself and her safety crew was wholly diluted.Portrayed as a heroine.What she did was selfish, I felt no element of compassion or others safety.I was left feeling that he passed purely down to her own actions and nothing more.He clearly had very strong feelings which impaired his actions, ibfelt she did nothing to try to help him and only focused on her achievements.Such a sad loss.~gs-53802 rated 9/10 on 31 July 2023"," Insightful Documentary about Freediving: Not A24's best film but it's still pretty good.It's an interesting documentary about freediver Alessia Zecchini andStephen Keenan on the goals, life, accomplishments and challenges they processes throughout her career with good insightful discussions and some gorgeous camerawork. Director Laura McGann does a pretty good job on capturing the career of Zecchini and maintaining the documentary's tone without feeling sloppy. The camerawork of the underwater sequences were absolutely gorgeous and beautiful. Documentaries about ocean life I always love because of the gorgeous production and shot compositions provided and The Deepest Breath does have some wonderful underwater scenes.Throughout, there were some really good editing and emotional moments that were genuinely interesting and touching. The conversations between participants were insightful but admittedly there were a few discussion moments that felt a little dragged on. The soundtrack choices felt a little cheesy and some pacing could have improved. Overall, it's a pretty good documentary.~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 20 July 2023"," Well made, extraordinary story, but...: Absolutely extraordinary story and well done documentary from a filmmaking stand point mixed with amazing music and underwater footage! A Homage to life. And also a deeper meaning on how people are desperately looking for a purpose/meaning of life and just wanna be seen, connected, acknowledged and loved. I dont want to spoil anything, but all i can say is: If you always play with fire you will eventually get burned! So this is the risk you are and must always be aware of!For me personally this sport is insane and these people in my opinion are looking in the wrong places to feel alive and special!Is a world record worth your life if you know hundreds of people died doing this..?!So unfortunately the films ending didnt have the impact it should have for me..

Down to the pictures, the recorded footage, the recorded audio, actal people who were really there to experience every minute of the journey that took place, was just astonishing.

At times stunning, at times anxiety-inducing, it's beautifully edited and it's a great story of two people finding their calling AND finding each other.I ended the movie with a few tears and an even deeper appreciation for ""carpe diem"" and for the beauty of (and respect for) the ocean.I strongly recommend it.~gusffern rated 9/10 on 30 July 2023"," Best Documentary since Free Solo: Beautiful and profound and a celebration of love and life and living.

He filmed his family and friends growing up then traveled, capturing meaningful moments with new people and places."," A privileged look inside the mind of someone who saw the world just a little differently.: This was a really special film, a mosaic of memories perfectly woven together. With thousands of hours of footage of Daniel's life to work with, this could have easily been a bloated film, one that could have been an extended and (understandably) indulgent look at a young man, by family, for family. Instead we get a quilted blanket that is neither too heavy, nor lacking substance.No matter what you believe, this film will make you wonder what if. What if lost things were found? What if the wrongfully removed were replaced? What if the ancient guardians of a cave of the dead had never lost their toy? What if we didn't so easily dismiss the old gods? We don't believe in silly curses and old world superstitions, but Daniel's story eats away at the foundation of those (non) beliefs.But for the talk of curses and premature endings, we're left with a profound feeling of admiration of a life well lived. This film was always about life, and by the end I can't help but think that the documentary has a life of its own. Rarely do people get to tell the story of their life so completely. Here, Daniel and his family get to tell his story as perfectly as can be told.Daniel has left me with lingering feelings. The emotions of his life's work are complex, but by the end of it I am certain of one thing: I will not feel sorry for Daniel.~Jamin-chaput rated 7/10 on 21 December 2023"," Almost wish it was longer: It's rare in these days of three hour plus movies to say I wish a film was longer, but in this case, I wish it was.It's an interesting film and well worth watching in terms of seeing someone living life to the fullest and suddenly finding themselves, unexpectedly, at the end of it all.My only complaint is at the end of 102 minutes, relatively short these days, that I didn't feel I knew Daniel as well as I could have. From what I understand he filmed over a thousand hours of his life, and this easily could have been a two hour to two and half hour film and I would've felt like I knew him better.On the upside, maybe more people will watch it as it's reasonably short and since it was produced by his sister, maybe she didn't know what best to include or leave out.In the end it would be difficult not to recommend it, as it is one of those ""live life while you can"" kind of stories. I just wish I got to know Daniel a little better over the course of the film and with all the available footage there was, I think the possibility was there.~micalclark rated NA on 24 December 2023"," One of the biggest honours of my life to be able to watch this.: This is the best film ever made, Dan, if you are reading this from across the impossible: i wish i'd know you and give you all the love you deserved, you were a gentleman, a true brother, son, friend, all things aside, You were a beautiful human being. Dan, i've seen all kinds of films, more than a thousand of them, i've never connected myself this close to a film like i have to yours.

It's also about loss, karma and acceptance.With people documenting so much of their lives these days on video, it makes for some stellar documentaries.Please watch this movie. It's a rarity to encounter a film that simultaneously captures the raw beauty of life and makes you mourn all who you've lost. I lost my brother eleven years ago and Daniel had me crying cathartic tears of grief. And I related to Daniel's loss of his grandmother to what I assume was dementia.Daniel also made me think about my son who is in a horribly depressed, hopeless and rebellious phase. At least I hope it's a phase. He's really hurting and I can't do anything to help. I hate this. It physically hurts to see your kid in so much pain. And to not feel empowered to do any of the comforting a mother would do, especially as one who shows love via touch. If only my son could see this documentary. He needs an infusion of the life force and demonstration of grace that is both Daniel the person and Daniel the movie (thanks in part to his loving sister who produced). I haven't been as inspired or moved since Anthony Bourdain passed away.~travellushmama rated 10/10 on 24 December 2023"," Beautiful story. Terribly depressing. Watch it.: Like the headline states. It's a beautiful story. But it's also very depressing. Daniel had such an interesting perspective on life. Something many of us can relate to. His journeys and experiences are things we can appreciate, because it's something we all want to see in life. It's a raw insight into the life of an extraordinary young man. A man who lived a life time. A man cut short of the life that could of brought so much more to this world. His journey shows us the beauty and the beasts of the world. The light and darkness that plays a a part of all our lives.

This is a must-see, brutally honest and beautifully told documentary that portrays the naked evil and barbarity of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine from a deeply human standpoint. Chernov's voice as a storyteller is achingly Ukrainian, and the film's tone and editing evoke a sort of spiritual pain that exceeds the material destruction of war.20 Days has a very strong edit that leaves in moments of Chernov's camera falling by his side as he's resting or unable to film: these moments add extra depth of realism and transport the audience into the warzone, not just watching some polished news report. There is almost a ""found footage"" quality to the edit and frantic first-person shaky cam scenes, but this film is much scarier and more disturbing than any horror movie could be because it's the truth, and to this very moment Mariupol is occupied by the same ruzzian butchers seen in this documentary.The music and sound are another highlight-- the film ends on images of russian occupation set to a disturbing, pulse-like tone. The music throughout by Jordan Dykstracompliments the scenes greatly and elevates the film's tone, both in highly disturbing war scenes and in moments of bleak, depressing stillness.20 Days in Mariupol is a cultural and historical document that should absolutely be shown in schools, especially in the West, so non-Ukrainian people can finally begin to understand the brutal, colonial and genocidal nature of russian imperialism. Mstyslav Chernov is nothing short of a hero in my eyes, and an incredibly brave and profoundly-spoken human being.Watch this film and show it to as many people as you can.~breakitdownforme rated 10/10 on 18 July 2023"," Gut Wrenching Must See: The most gut wrenching film I've ever watched.

She lived directly across the street from hospital #2, which is where the filmmakers hid through much of the movie. The area all along Kuprina St, adjacent to the hospital and small church, sits at the very western edge of the city, which took the brunt of the attacks approaching from Crimea direction. Mom eventually made it out after 70 days, barely.None of my family will watch this movie except me. Everything is too close and too familiar. One thing the movie does not show is how vibrant and thriving this same city had been prior to 2/24/22. It seems surreal to see your old comfortable neighborhood get intentionally destroyed on international news. To be honest, the Russians were so jealous of Mariupol that they tried to murder it. They cannot get away with this.This is a story that absolutely needs to be seen and heard - without any sugar-coating - as painful as it may be.~sconnacher-51408 rated 10/10 on 28 May 2023"," Pain, rage and fear: Piece of concentrated pain, rage and fear. I am from Kharkiv and I left my city on 24 Feb, but of course I was reading all news about Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and other cities. There were events I absolutely forgot and the film reminded me about them - I remember the photo of maternity hospital, photo of elderly man sitting next to body covered in blanket and photo of parents who lost their child. Horrific atrocities.More people needs to see this. People from russia are masters in plotting new truths by denying real truth - our mission should be to protect real truth and show it to people.I probably wont sleep today - the film left deep wounds on my heart. Or maybe I wont sleep because russia launches drones and missiles to attack Kyiv, who knows.~kateknyaz rated 10/10 on 11 June 2023"," Please, Please, WATCH THIS!: This is a brilliant, moving, audacious documentary from an extremely talented videographer and team, and deserves at least an Emmy and, even more preferably, an Oscar, but awards are not enough for this exceptional work.This is a rare, you-are-there experience, in which you are immersed in the Russian takeover of a city in the Ukraine, and where you feel every emotion that these poor beseighed people feel.The documentary starts on the week of March in which the Russian oligarch Putin (not the President, which would mean that he was elected) announces to the people of Ukraine that he is about to invade the country, and within moments, actually does launch a full-scale invasion, and we watch it happen almost moment by moment. Bombs fall on Soviet-style apartment complexes at a rate of hundreds a day, and the entire landscape soon begins to resemble the aftermath of Hiroshima.But what is most dynamic is the actual impact on the people themselves, many of whom do not know who is bombing them. Astounding. Watching children, pregnant moms, and hospital workers taking the worst beating of all is utterly depressing, but, like all medicine, needs to be taken and swallowed whole.Overall, this documentary is one of the most heart-wrenching, devastating, tear-jerking experiences ever. You owe it to yourself to see this to get the full effect, since words can never describe how much of an impact it will have on you.It is a shame that it would only be available on PBS, since that will alienate at least 95% of the population that needs to watch it, but if there is even a smidgen of justice left in the world, the few who see it will tell everyone they know, and hopefully, something will come from it.Thanks to the brave filmmakers who told this shocking story.~naq-1 rated 10/10 on 15 December 2023"," A great reminder of what's going on in Ukraine, must see: This documentary is about as real as it gets. The film is pieced together from footage shot in Mariupol during February and March 2022. You might have already seen snippets, especially from the maternity hospital, but this takes you day by day and includes some less common materials.I won't get into the usual critiques of quality or story flow. That would be idiotic. They captured what they could in the midst of war, when everything including electricity for their cameras was at scarce. It surprises me that some reviewers are complaining, as if this were some Hollywood production in the making for five years. Jesus.I recommend watching it. The war is ongoing, and it won't just disappear because we're tired of it. It serves as a powerful reminder to the world about what's happening in Ukraine every day.~imdbscuff rated 8/10 on 30 November 2023"," Excrutiating, must-watch testimony of the annihilation of Mariupol: Devastating, horrific coverage of what happened to Mariupol and other UA territories occupied by the Russians.

The documentary does a pretty good job portraying the harsh looks amongst the conflicts happening in Ukraine, how citizens are being effected by the war and the troubles happening revolving around politics.Director Mstyslav Chernov offers such an brutal look of the political situation between Ukraine and Russia through the lens within 20 days. Great camerawork and soundtrack that was provided as well. Whether you agree with the political stances or what, there is no denial that the film does a pretty good job exploring the side effects of war and struggles. There are scenes where dead bodies that were shown fully on the camerawork and people losing their sanity over the war throughout and they were really hard to watch. Every participate that was interviewed and any scenes that were shot felt raw and brutal to witness.There were some technical elements that could have been improved as it was a little distracting at times.

It's moving, but also a testament to how much stunt work was done beforehand so that Daniel Radcliffe could perform it safely for the films.It's sad and scary to see how his life changed in an instant, despite all the precautions. The actual accident is not shown, which is a good decision by the filmmakers.Daniel Radcliffe is interviewed extensively, and it speaks well of him that he maintains connections that developed during the movies' filming.David's story isn't easy to watch, as a cyst also made his right arm less functional since the accident. But he carries on the best he can. His attitude is fairly upbeat, considering his circumstances.So many people came out of the HP movies better off, so it's fitting that somebody who came out worse gets acknowledgement for his efforts and unwanted sacrifice.~paulwetor rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Very touching: I loved that we got the chance to see a part of the films that we've never seen before, even though it is not a happy part at all.

I would recommend this, although it's not necessarily an easy watch, but definitely worth it it, it makes you think about how fragile the human body is and a neck injury is just a terrible thing to happen, and I tell you what, a lot of people wouldn't have coped with it as well as Dave did, so there is a lot to be admired from him.

Filling in the Blanks (2023) - IMDb,6.9,Jon Baime|Philip Schaefer,Jon Baime,Jon Baime,"When 54 year old Jon Baime takes a DNA test, his world and sense of self identity is shattered by a family secret."," Must see if you are into DNA testing: I am surprised I am the first one rating this very well done documentary. This movie is a must see to any one who has done DNA testing and found surprises once the results comes back. While this documentary focus exclusively about being conceived through a sperm donor, the emotional road each person travels once he/she finds out the truth, is not much different than finding out one is adopted, or that one of your parents had an affair. I do believe that for all those people that are experiencing DNA surprises, this documentary will help you understand, forgive, reconcile.At time Jon Baime sense of humor reminded me of Seinfeld. He keeps the documentary light and smoothly paced. I loved the cake message, the ending in the wall, and the gratitude shown. I find it refreshing that someone had the courage and goodwill to share his story. Kudos to the Blaine brothers for helping Jon making this documentary.~pmurguiaw rated 10/10 on 7 September 2023"," An Unexpected DNA Odyssey: ""Filling in the Blanks"": Unveiling Paternal Identities in a Modern Tale""Filling In the Blanks"" is a poignant and thought-provoking documentary that delves deep into the lives of middle-aged individuals who discover the truth about their biological fathers through proprietary DNA analysis. Directed with finesse and sensitivity, the film offers a revelatory exploration of identity, family dynamics, and the emotional rollercoaster that accompanies such unexpected revelations.The film's central character, a middle-aged man grappling with the shock of discovering his true biological heritage, becomes the audience's guide through this complex journey of self-discovery. Through direct interviews, viewers are granted intimate access to the raw emotions of not only the protagonist but also his newfound brothers and sisters who share the same extraordinary situation. The documentary expertly captures their diverse range of reactions, highlighting that there is no one-size-fits-all response to such life-altering news.One of the most compelling aspects of the documentary is its exploration of the varying emotional landscapes of the siblings. Some are genuinely surprised, while others experience a profound sense of relief, shedding the unwanted baggage of their non-biological fathers. Amidst these disparate reactions, one common thread emerges - the unwavering love and dedication of their mothers, regardless of the paternal complexities. This underscores the powerful and enduring bonds that tie families together, transcending the boundaries of biology.As the narrative unfolds, the film deftly navigates the multifaceted layers of the human experience. It shines a spotlight on the societal shifts and attitudes of the past, specifically addressing the reluctant acceptance of artificial insemination during the 1960s. This contextual backstory adds depth to the broader discussion on identity and challenges our perceptions of family structures. The filmmakers are careful to present a balanced portrayal, allowing the audience to ponder the complexities and ethical considerations surrounding artificial insemination.An engaging and heartwarming subplot centers around the siblings' journey to connect with their biological father. The documentary captures their excitement and trepidation as they embark on this unique quest for self-discovery. The genuine warmth and openness of the biological father as he welcomes his newfound children into his life provide a touching counterpoint to the initial shock of the revelations. His willingness to share his medical history and personal experiences helps foster a sense of closure and understanding for the siblings, who yearned for a connection that had been concealed from them for so long.""Filling in the Blanks"" excels in its ability to provoke introspection and dialogue on sensitive subjects. It raises important questions about the timing and necessity of disclosing the truth in cases of artificial insemination, highlighting the evolving perspectives on transparency and the potential impact on individual well-being. The documentary serves as a catalyst for conversations surrounding family secrets, the evolving nature of family structures, and the significance of genetic ties.In conclusion, ""Filling in the Blanks"" is a captivating documentary that masterfully captures the complexities of identity, family, and the profound impact of newfound revelations.

By shedding light on the deeply personal experiences of the characters, the documentary succeeds in its mission to illuminate the intricate tapestry of human relationships and the transformative power of truth.~yatnickrd rated 10/10 on 7 September 2023"," Incredible Discovery Journey: I was immediately captivated by the trailer and therefore wanted to watch the whole documentary.

Pandit|Jimmy Shaw|David Shih|Cameron Silsbee|Cassie Simons,Amanda McBaine|Jesse Moss,Amanda McBaine|Jesse Moss,"26-year-old American missionary John Chau was killed as he attempted to make contact with an Indigenous group off the coast of India, one of the last communities on the planet still living in isolation."," what drove him to face the arrows: Greetings again from the darkness. What is left that no one has done? It's a question that the most adventurous among us ask themselves. John Chau was certainly an adventurer. He ran marathons, loved hiking through forests, and enjoyed rock and mountain climbing. His dream was to venture onto the North Sentinel Island and introduce Jesus to the island's sole inhabitants. The Sentinelese are an isolated human community of hunter-gatherers who have made it abundantly clear over the years that they do not welcome outside visitors.In 2018, when the news report hit that 26-year-old John Chau had been killed while trying to make contact with The Sentinelese, my initial and immediate reaction was to call him an arrogant jerk who probably got what he deserved. Co-directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss, through National Geographic Documentary Films, have brought us more of John Chau's story so that we (me) can better understand his motivation and how it fits into the historical aspect of missionary work.McBaine and Moss explore the various stories here, which include: a community of folks living life on their own terms, the overreach of religion, the role of missionaries, a young man wanting to make a difference, and a father-son relationship. Much of John's story is taken directly from the journal he kept right up until the day he died. The directors also effectively use the letter from John's father, which is read aloud and displayed through animation. Additionally, there are interviews with John's friend, an historian, and a long-time missionary. We learn that as a kid, John was attracted to stories such as ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Tintin"", as well as drawing inspiration from movies like END OF THE SPEAR. His attraction to adventure began at an early age, and it was the draw of religion that really struck a chord.As a Chinese-American and evangelical Christian, it is said that he might have believed the indigenous people were waiting for him to bring them The Truth. Whether he believed this or instead simply felt it was his responsibility, speaks to a level of conceit rarely seen outside of religion or politics. What is abundantly clear is that as a disciple of 'The Great Commission', John's radical approach paid little mind or respect to the uncorrupted culture of this isolated tribe. This is why, as his long-time friend describes, he had to pay pirates to take him uninvited to the island to talk about Jesus. It's a conceit that will not compute for me, regardless of his religious beliefs.North Sentinel Island is part of the Andaman Islands (where the legend of King Kong took place) and it is protected by the government of India. John Chau's ""Plan"" even included a section detailing the illegality of his mission. The filmmakers structure the film with the first hour being mostly background and setup, while the final 45 minutes dig into John's trip to the island - a trip best described in the movie as 'idealism masquerading as God's will.' John's father carried a burden of parental guilt, which is understandable; however, most of this boils down to John's own ignorance and conceit. As thorough as the research is, and as interesting as the history is, none of it has changed my mind about John Chau.Opens October 27, 2023 in theaters.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 26 October 2023"," Sad story of a misguided young man who died for his faith.: A missionary died while attempting to reach a remote tribe in the Bay of Bengal. All of the commentary and spokespersons are devout Christians who tell the story about John Chau being killed by arrows shot by natives on the Sentinel Islands.He spent his short life preparing to become a missionary in order to save people from hell through the word of Jesus Christ. He was inspired by evangelical religious people including Orel Roberts to undertake his mission. Evangelicals believe that people are doomed to an eternity in the fiery pit of hell if they do not receive the news that Jesus loves you.Paul Chau's desire to convert the remote tribe in the Bay of Bengal drove him to take a boat near the island and to paddle a kayak to shore where he was unwelcome. He was shot by an arrow on his first attempt. The arrow, shot by a child, pierced his bible as he was declaring to the tribe that he was there under God's authority. He retreated only to try again. On his second attempt, he was murdered with arrows and presumed dead from his injuries. The body has never been recovered and no one has been held to account.The people there live on their own small forested island called North Sentinel, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, and which is part of an island chain that is also home to another uncontacted tribe, the Shompen.Paul Chau saved no one and he died in the attempt.This is a strange movie. The first part seems like a Christian presentation because so many of the people are very religious evangelicals. They believe that their faith should be adopted and practiced by every human being on earth. The death of Chau may serve as an inspiration for some future missionary to attempt to convert these islanders.~ligonlaw rated 2/10 on 30 November 2023"," Why glorify stupidity?: Why on earth would you make a documentary praising and glorifying an idiot who defied all warnings from the government to NOT visit that island, telling him he would definitely be killed if he went there? Visiting that island is strictly forbidden, and he knew this, but decided to break the law anyways, all so he could preach some false gospel to people who have no interest in Christianity. John made a stupid decision to potentially endanger the locals of the island, and he paid the price. This documentary should never have been made, let alone show him in a positive light, which could inspire others to copy him.~Navyfilmdude rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," Not really a documentary: This story is wildly sad and unfortunately told with a bias towards the individual involved, John. I'm sure many will see this as an inspiration to repeat this tragic behavior in the name of God. I have but one question for the Christian community as a whole. Assuming you believe God is all powerful, all knowing and all mighty. Why does God need you to do God's work? If God is all powerful, then God can speak to any human God wishes to speak with and provide guidance without the help of other humans. The fact that there are people so unbelievably arrogant that think a book written by men is the actual work of and word of God it's simply mind boggling. To believe you are needed means God it's not capable thus not a God is just as mind boggling. This poor soul died due to human arrogance and this story only promotes it without balance.~leeaumend-38280 rated 2/10 on 12 December 2023"," Similar to ""Savior Complex"" (but not nearly as good): As ""The Mission"" (2023 release; 103 min) opens, we are introduced to John Chau, an evangelican Christian who is hellbent on doing missionary, the further away and more isolated, the better. Through something called ""Unreached People"", he sets his sights on the 200 or so resident on the North Sentinel Island, one of the most isolated spots on earth (in the Bay of Bengal)...Couple of comments: this is the second documentary from co-directors (and real life husband and wife) Jesse Moss and Amanda McBain (""Boys State""). Here they reassess the life and times of John Chau, the evangelican Christian whose mission went horribly wrong. Of course it raises the issue of the assumed superiority by (almost always white) people who are determined to show the rest of the world how it's done and how to live a proper and meaningful life. The thought that maybe, just maybe, this is just insanely arrogant, if not worse, doesn't even enter their universe. All of these themes were also examined in another documentary from earlier this year called ""Savior Complex"", and frankly better than in ""The Mission"". (As a complete aside, please do not confuse this documentary with the 1986 movie of the same name starring Robert de Niro. They are completely unrelated projects.)""The Mission"" premiered at the Telluride film festival some months back and it is now streaming on Hulu. If you are curious about the moral pros and cons of religious missionary work by white people across the globe, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.~paul-allaer rated 6/10 on 14 December 2023"," Moronic behaviour: Why on earth do people feel the need to force their views and opinions on others?Especially ones that live in the middle of nowhere and have made it clear they do not want to be contacted?I actually think this makes religious nutters look even worse than I thought possible.I've got a great idea why don't I go and force my opinions and views on other people that aren't interested!? There in lies the problem with the world and this piece of garbage.The movie romanticised him way too much in the beginning and I actually think he got what he deserved...I know that may sound harsh, but I think the moral of the story is leave people to live in peace and mind you own business.~paulosav1970 rated 2/10 on 12 December 2023"," Glorification of hopeless act: I started watching this documentary to see the glimpse of sentinal island. However i think what they are showing is just another fake island. This is pure waste of 1hr 40 mins. In the start of this documentary the character says "" is this the last fort of devil?"" why devil? It is untouched nature just let it be as is. Why do john wants to destroy it?This documentry (?) glorifies the foolish act of spreading christianity where it is not needed. Why do missionaries want to force their views on world? Why do this john character wanted to enforce his beliefs on people who are kept protected from world? He endangered them by visiting that place. I do not understand the purpose of this documentary. It looks like director wanted to showcase how that fool was having a strong faith and what he did was to spread his beliefs (unncessarily on others)~vikrant-korde rated 1/10 on 12 December 2023"," Not quite sure what I watched.: So first off, the guy behind me fell asleep (he was snoring and breathing loudly), the guy to my right got up and left 3/4 of the way through, the woman to my left fell asleep and the woman in front of me fell asleep.Almost every blackout in the film people were disappointed that there was more content when it faded back up.During the Q&A section, the audience was like a block of ice. The filmmakers didn't say much to break it.Overall, it was a decent film, but not made very well and largely forgettable. Animation was used for parts they didn't have footage for, but it would have been better to style it like Tintin. There was a supplemental reader out in the lobby that, missed opportunity, they should have made look like a Tintin book.No disrespect to the guy who died (allegedly), but the film seemed very pro-Jesus with only a few dissenters from that theorem who were also pro-Jesus. It didn't do a great job at portraying both sides. I am not quite sure what the message was. ""Don't following dogmatic religious zealotry?"" ""Believe what's in your heart even if it kills you?"" I just don't know. A very odd choice for NatGeo to pick this up, but they're becoming a bit like Netflix.The content leading up to the end just wasn't presented interestingly enough. It explored this isolated foreign culture but I wasn't quite sure why I was watching it or why it was important.If you want to see a better story of a missionary, go see ""The Book of Mormon."" Not even kidding. It's a lot more balanced in perspective than whatever I just saw was.Also, the title really should have been called ""The Missionary."" Its current title is too wracked with ingrained spy/espionage tropes, or elicits ""Mission Impossible"" sentiments. I was quite disappointed we weren't watching a good spy movie with lots of explosions, but I didn't really look into what this was until I got there.Jesus.~cpuser999 rated 4/10 on 7 November 2023"," Is It Altruism or Arrogance?: Is religious missionary work an act of altruism or arrogance? Does it represent a quest for the fulfillment of one's spiritual potential or a euphemistic cover for an inflated sociopathic ego? And, in either case, is it even possible to distinguish the two? Those are legitimate questions in the case of 26-year-old fundamentalist Christian missionary John Chau, who disappeared and was presumed dead in 2018 while attempting to spread the word of Jesus to the reclusive indigenous residents of North Sentinel Island, an Indian protectorate in the Bay of Bengal. The locale, one of the world's most difficult destinations to reach and one that's strictly off limits to outsiders, is home to an obscure, little-known tribe with a reputation for being mistrusting of and unwelcoming to strangers. Yet Chau was convinced that it was his destiny to convert them to Christianity no matter what, even at the cost of his life, a concern that worried his family, friends and seasoned missionaries who had attempted comparable initiatives with native people in other parts of the world. It was an effort that raised questions about Chau's motivations: Was he a committed religious zealot who truly wanted to spread the word of Christ, or was he suffering from a maniacal Messiah Complex hell-bent on testing the limits of his courage, hubris and personal capabilities? Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss seek to answer these and other thorny questions about this enigmatic individual whose real intents may never really be known, leaving lingering doubts and pain about his mission in the minds of those who knew him. Thanks to unprecedented access to Chau's kindreds, as well as his recovered diaries, the filmmakers tell a captivating tale about his experience, along with thought-provoking ethical examinations about the nature and propriety of missionary work in connection with indigenous societies. Should it continue? Is it appropriate for Westerners and devout Christians to interfere in the spiritual lives of those who adhere to alternate viewpoints? Indeed, are these people genuinely in need of being ""fixed,"" regardless of the alleged nobility behind the intentions of those seeking to carry out these transformations? ""The Mission"" offers viewers a delicately balanced view of these notions, prompting even the most dedicated disciples of this work to step back and take a new look at what they and their peers are carrying out. It also presents an eye-opening discussion of this subject, encouraging us to ask ourselves, how much is too much when it comes to missionary work, regardless of the religion involved? And when is it appropriate to leave things as they are for those who already appear to be happy and contented in their lives and beliefs? There's a lot on the line in this Critics Choice Documentary Award nominee, and, in light of the nature of its story, that's something we must never lose sight of.~brentsbulletinboard rated 9/10 on 13 December 2023"," Hilarious study in hubris.: Damn, this is mind blowing.Violating the human rights of the ""sentinelese"" by not introducing them to jesus?Right, whilst the missionary's hawking product tie-ins on their social media - I'm sure that's what jesus had in mind when throwing the money lenders out the temple. In fact, I think that part of jesus' life was sponsored by Mountain Dew.Nevermind the Human Right of the Sentinese to have hidden cameras placed on their island so the missionary could study them or potentially have illness/disease introduced to them that they have no immunity to.I remember 9/11 and the New York lady that was circulated in the media ""why do they hate us""?It's up to you to decide, but personally I found no redeeming features in any of the social group of the missionary, who I could best desribe as well-intentioned, but ultimately dangerous proto-fascists ""for christ"".I've had the misfortune of being around evangelicals - if you're not one of them ""converting"" you seems to be how they measure their own worth - not living as christ, but bullying, cajoling, threatening, bribing - all whilst failing to observe the beam in their own eyes.Nothing of value was lost here other than the time the Sentinelese took to dispose of this ""person"" that they no doubt could have spent not being disturbed.~seven-johnson rated 6/10 on 13 December 2023"
Last Stop Larrimah (2023) - IMDb,7.1,Pam Arlund|Dan Davis|Levi Davis|Daniel Everett|Adam Goodheart|Mary Ho|Lawrence Kao|Arin Okada|T.N. Pandit|Jimmy Shaw|David Shih|Cameron Silsbee|Cassie Simons,Amanda McBaine|Jesse Moss,Amanda McBaine|Jesse Moss,"Nestled deep in the Australian Outback is the town of Larrimah and its 11 eccentric residents. When one of them mysteriously disappears into thin air, the remaining residents become suspects and a long history of infighting is unveiled."," The kind of mysteries Netflix should be involved with! [+68%]: I love stories about small towns. So, this one really intrigued me from the get-go. The piece begins with the (ten) inhabitants talking about their decision to move to Larrimah in the first place, and what they love about it. We then move to the mystery of a missing man and the filters of suspicion suddenly switch on. Frankly, the slow-burn reveals of the townsfolk surprised me one after the other. Not only do some hold major grudges against the rest, but they're also completely open about it.The aesthetics of the place (and its people) had my attention throughout. The pub with the crocodile, the pie shop, the bush, the stilt houses, the large open spaces, the dogs, the sunsets - there's something about the place that even a complete outsider like me can get drawn to. The interviews are spread out between all of the residents of the town, and everyone gets to voice their thoughts. The place, the story of the missing man, the people (their ongoing grudges and motives) - I feel this has everything needed for a neo-noir crime drama, at least on paper. It's predominantly Australian too - like, where else do you see folks candidly talk about murder while chugging beer, smoking, or laughing their butt off?~arungeorge13 rated 7/10 on 23 October 2023"," This is such a quirky, but interesting documentary.: Larrimah is an Australian town with only ten residents, until recently it has eleven, only Paddy was killed, The Police believed that Paddy's adversary killed him, and the motive was pies...What a fascinating story this is, not the usual documentary I opt for on Netflix, but it's totally engaging.I loved the pacing, early on I didn't quite know which way it was heading, it all seemed sweet and lovely, with some very interesting and very open people, but as it develops, the scandals and open hatred comes seeping through.I honestly couldn't believe some of the revelations, wow, there was some real resentment, and in a town of eleven people, that was likely to cause problems.It's a little padded out in parts, but the interviews are so interesting, especially the lady from the pie shop. So many characters.What an incredible place, it really does look like a place that has once seen better days, but is somewhat off even that pace.Very entertaining.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 25 October 2023"," Tiger King in the Aussie Outback.: Without any tigers involved, this documentary reminded me of Tiger King. Plenty of drama and feuds between a tiny community.It's 2 x 50 min episodes. It doesn't drag and all the information is squeezed in perfectly. For a town of 11 residents , the entertainment and stories flow as good as any top shelf soap opera.It's also very funny at times. Plenty of thought provoking scenarios in this 'Who Done it?' Documentary.It is a real little gem of a find. I surfed into on Netflix and watched both episodes back to back. This would make a great film or mini-series.You get a glimpse into the sad, boring lives of people who have chosen to spend decades in a human dust pond.~rochfordsimon rated 8/10 on 22 October 2023"," Land of plenty feuds: If you love Fargo (the film), you'll probably enjoy this as a real life whodunnit, with a wealth of eccentric Fargo-like characters, each and every one of them far stranger than fiction.In a nutshell, this true story revolves around 11 people who are the sole inhabitants of a tiny villlage off the beaten track in northern Australië. Did I say 11? I mean 10. One of them has mysteriously disappeared, presumably murdered. You'd think with such a meagre population it wouldn't be too difficult to narrow down a suspect or two, right? Yeah, unless the potential murder victim had more than a few enemies among his ten-fold brethren.To further complicate matters, the remaining ten don't like (any of) each other much either, and that's me putting it very mildly.This 2 episode series is hard to compare with anything else, but I can say this: the individuals who tell the story - Larrimah's population, all of them potential suspects (and some cops from the nearest glimpse of civilization) - had me completely absorbed. There's lots to say about them, but it's hard to find the words, I assure you. And if you have yet to watch this, the less said the better.~Roma73 rated 10/10 on 23 October 2023"," Fargo in Aussie: This was great. They way the story is told, will keep you guessing. Guessing which side you're on. They cinematography is really well excecuted and the line up of real life characters is unbeliveable. A gem for the true crime audiences out there. But it also tells the tale of humans- humans with too much time on their hands, living in the middle of nowhere, drinking the day away, just being.I kind of want to go visit the town now, that i feel like i know everybody there. Meet the colorful characters, have a beer, and talk about what REALLY happened that night Paddy went missing. Great, great documentary.~Marathonmax rated 9/10 on 23 October 2023"," Rather Intriguing Fargo, Australia: This was quite a surprise and I found myself intrigued from beginning to end- a very quirky, frustrating, enigmatic tale of the murder of someone who may or may not have been a great Irish immigrant, may or may not have been a great neighbor, may or may not have been a pot-stirrer, and his dog (NO NOT THE DOG!!) neither of which deserved to be killed in cold blood for nothing in particular.The residents are a menagerie of characters- some of which feel quite slimy- amongst them Fran and Owen, of which seem to be painted in an unflattering light yet they do absolutely nothing to help themselves fight the portrayal. They're both quite vitriolic and full of blame for all their problems on anyone but themselves. Then there's Karen and.her husband, but she seems to like the camera more than her husband. The name definitely seems to fit, as she epitomizes it in virtually every way possible.So many people are castigated by the others, including a lot of whining, miserable miscreants who can't seem to find a way to keep a business afloat yet keep plenty busy with keeping the rumor mill running full steam, having no problem with tossing ridiculous accusations and nonsensical claims with absolutely no regard for the man who has been missing and presumed dead or those they happen to share a community with.All that being said, it's a seemingly lighthearted and somewhat cheeky true crime documentary but never loses sight of the fact that an innocent man lost his life and has never been heard from again. It's a rather interesting story told in a fascinating way that's a fresh new way, so be prepared for every budding artist to now put their spin on this and fill the void with some of the insipid work the genre has seen since Jimmy Hoffa went for a walk.~helenahandbasket-93734 rated 8/10 on 24 October 2023"," Original and interesting: Larrimah redefines 'small town'. Almost everyone is a murder suspect in this town with a population of 10 citizens, and almost everyone had an altercation or feud with Patrick Moriarty. It is a very interesting documentary. To see the once thriving Larrimah be run into the ground by its own residents was very sad. The clashes between the neighbours seems petty at first, but we soon learn that the tension run much deeper and darker than expected. I felt sympathy for Fran Hodgetts. I do not believe she was treated fairly by those interviewing her and the filmmakers, instead it looked like there was attempts to make her into a laughing stock purely based on the person she is. The things she said about Patrick in the past footage was edited and replayed to make her seem suspicious or the likely murderer - but on reflection, anyone who had a feud with someone would say similar tongue in cheek phrases such as 'What goes around comes around'. Nothing she said screamed 'Murderer' to me, and as we see at the end of the documentary, it is fairly obvious who the likely killer is. I expected the town to crumble as the documentary was coming to a close, however I was surprised at how pleased and emotional I was to see that there is new hope for Larrimah. Hopefully the new and old residents can learn from past mistakes and build a promising future together. I have every hope.~JR_1_ rated 9/10 on 25 October 2023"," Bad Day at Outback: There's a-feuding and a-fussing and a-fighting in Netflix's documentary ""Last Stop Larrimah,"" population eleven, minus one, all in all, a homey expose of the simple pleasures in the land-down-under: beer, meat pies, the great outdoors, beer, man's best friend, and deep-rooted, festering, personal animosities.In a way, the outback is Australia's badlands, where life is close to the land until it's eventually underneath it. For some, like local eccentric, Paddy Moriarty, whose head meets with a hammer, maybe too soon.There's larceny in the heartland, so it seems, and intense loathing, bitterness, heaps of grudges and accusations, but worst of all, insanity where there ought to be sanctuary. The inhabitants of misery's reward, this narcoleptic watering hole, have forsaken modesty and a shirt, to air their petty grievances, with some reluctant remorse, over the course of five years. Wasted effort, it seems, for a lot of ornery Aussies, one transplanted Irishman, and a dog.~jgreco7 rated 4/10 on 24 October 2023"," How bizarre: Ok, weird anomaly watching ""Last stop in Larrimah"", after watching ""Pain Hustlers"", ""Transparent"" inadvertently!!. I'm a true blue Aussie and obviously now a Jay Duplass fan without knowing it. I'd heard the podcast and the visual will hope help find the culprit. Worth the watch!Pure coincidence in hitting the button to watch this informative documentary but insightful to the going's of the outback especially where a missing person/murder has occurred (think Pete Falconio) for us regional mob or the city slickers and I guess the rest of the world.

You guys really captured the heart of Larrimah. I cried at the ending.Peter Allen gets me every time.Each new piece of evidence has you on the edge of your seat secretly convicting the next person who is spoken about poorly by their 10 person town neighbour.I love that Larrimah's legacy lives on in the young new blood that is now running in its veins! I hope Larrimah's new baby gets to write a whole new story for the town!I was going to stop there but I need 600 words so good luck to the crocodile as well.Maybe there will be some little baby reptiles kicking around town soon.Perhaps someone will invest in reviving the tourist park.What else?Part 3?Ok. I'm still going apparently.I LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE.I HOPE WE FIND PADDY AND HIS DOG.PLEASE MAKE YOUR NEXT INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE WIEAMBILLA KILLINGS!~rebeccadburgess rated 10/10 on 16 November 2023
