However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.~M_Exchange rated 6/10 on 30 November 2023"," Derivative, but with a twist: Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.~euroGary rated 8/10 on 9 October 2023"," Oliver Quick & The Dead: It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 6/10 on 23 December 2023"," Twisted yet enchanting: Emerald Fennell leaps over any potential sophomore slumps with Saltburn, an immensely twisted tale of obsession and excess that's black comedy eventually goes into much darker territory. It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen). Equally strong is Fennell's screenplay which is hilarious, almost every scene has at least one memorable joke or biting line of dialogue.~masonsaul rated 9/10 on 4 October 2023"," Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value: Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.~brentsbulletinboard rated 3/10 on 9 December 2023"," An artful disappointment: Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.~steveinadelaide rated 5/10 on 24 November 2023"," Saltburn delivers on every level, a captivating film.: Oliver Quick becomes captivated by fellow student at Oxford, Felix. When Felix tells Oliver that his father has died, Felix invites Oliver back to his family home, the grand mansion estate of Saltburn.Imagine coming from a humble background, and being dropped into a world of luxury and abundance, where aristocrats live their lives detached from reality.This had me captivated from start to finish, truly one of the most unique and original films that I've seen for some time.The trailer captivated me, I had high expectations, if I'm honest, it exceeded my expectations. The writing oozed quality, great story, with some magnificent characters.At times it's bizarre, amusing, sexy and intriguing, and at times it's just plain weird. It simmers away for the most part, until the last fifteen minutes or so, when it transformation with a jaw dropping twist.Beautifully filmed, it looks amazing, some of the camera work is exquisite, and that building is simply glorious.The acting is first rate, Rosamund Pike, Richard E Grant and Carey Mulligan are all spot on, Barry Keoghan however, his performance deserves awards, that dance!! Won't forget that in a hurry.Loved it, and didn't want it to end.9/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 9/10 on 17 November 2023"," Not for the squeamish: SaltburnNow this was an interesting film. It's a mind game. It's manipulation. And it's nefarious. Be prepared to squirm Be prepared to gasp. Be prepared to say ""oh dear God"" a few times. The movie follows a very shy and quiet Oxford student on his quest to fit in. After a school year, he is invited to join his new friend at his family's enormous castle where we definitely see him in a fish out of water situation.Then things... happen. Oh boy do they happen. This is all I'm going to say but be prepared for a wild ride, and don't be squeamish. I enjoyed this, but it really deserves its R rating. It's very adult and highlights the depths human beings can go, regardless of material wealth.You know I love to find the human experience presented, possibly with a lesson in mental health awareness. Oh God no. Perhaps there is awareness, but there is no lesson.Rosamund Pike does steal the show. Her one liners are absolutely hilarious.Enjoy the ride.~malmevik77 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"," ð I loved the Cinematography and Gothic Production Design. However, the Film Doesn't Fully Coalesce and Just Sort of Falls Apart (For Me) ð¤·: Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING ð«ð - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience ðð³Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. ð¦ The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. ð¾ The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good.

I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did itð)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. ð©One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. ð©But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtubðð³ and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. ðð¤·3. ð©Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. ð4. ð©The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""ð7. ð¤¦ð» Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.~DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed rated 6/10 on 19 November 2023"," Murky pretentious derivative mess: Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.~Laight rated 2/10 on 24 December 2023"

Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.TimothÃ©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 9 December 2023"," 2023's most enjoyable holiday hit: Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows TimothÃ©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)~eddie_baggins rated 8/10 on 14 December 2023"," This had no business being this good!: I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one.~thabaddest-74261 rated 10/10 on 24 December 2023"," It looks the part, the actors are terrific, but the actual story and the songs fail to really excite me.: Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 9 December 2023"," A perfect festive treat.: Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from TimothÃ©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," Come with me to a world of your imagination: WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10.~Padreviews rated 10/10 on 14 December 2023"," An Imaginative Fantastic Journey: I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film.~DeltaHomicide rated 9/10 on 6 December 2023"," Missing that Oomph: Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did.~Larsii90 rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Loved It!: As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you.~bb52366 rated 10/10 on 9 December 2023"

So they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple."," It's exactly what you expect: This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better.~miza004 rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Forgettable rom-com that fails to spark and lacks romantic chemistry, hindered by bland acting from Sydney Sweeney and rushed, empty character development: A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time.~ambusched94 rated 2/10 on 31 December 2023"," How?: I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs.~Remmuchan rated 3/10 on 27 December 2023"," Bad Movie: Rating: 4.4Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable.~cinemapersonified rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Pure escapism featuring beautiful people, beautiful locations with lots of laugh out loud moments: This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this.~MichaelByTheSea rated 9/10 on 26 December 2023"," Cringe, boring comedy with paper thin romance. If this is what is called romantic and funny nowadays, then love and comedy are dead!: I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and taken seriously.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!~NatKaminska rated 1/10 on 28 December 2023"," People got paid for this??: Horrible horrible film. My wife enjoys the classic rom coms and we enjoy modern ones when they understand how to make it fun, cheesy and pleasant to watch. This movie had NONE of those things. The acting was like watching a bad high school play. Zero chemistry between any of the actors/characters. The script itself was awful and it was ZERO fun to watch. I just wanted it to be over and would have loved to walk out of the theatre before it was over. Just save your money and stay away. There is also random gross nudity.

How did she get cast in this lead?! She was terrible. And there is no chemistry between Glen Powell and Sweeney. I know she has some other credits but HOW did she get this film?In every single scene, she is wearing revealing clothing. See-thru fabric or clingy fabric, and the tiniest bikinis or thongs. And sometimes she is just naked. She has a great body but she is trying sooooo hard to show it off that you begin to feel embarrassed for the actress. But that's when I began to suspect that perhaps SHE was the producer. I've seen it before where an actress self-produces a film, casting herself in a sexy leading role opposite a hot guy. In this case, she is opposite two hot guys who both desire her. We've all seen women who try hard to be sexy. The harder they try, the bigger they fail. There is nothing as UNsexy as a person TRYING to be sexy. And that is Sydney Sweeney throughout this film.Glen Powell needs to be more selective in his role choices. He does the best he could with a bad script and awful leading lady. But he should have pushed back at some of the lousy direction.Powell played a character. Sweeney played a caricature.A particularly stupid scene is on a cliff where Powell and Sweeney are trying to convince the group (standing behind them) that they are lovers. Powell ""awkwardly"" tries to put his hand ""awkwardly"" on Sweeney's ass. But he ""awkwardly"" doesn't know what to do with his hand. So he ""awkwardly"" ends up almost playing bongos on her butt. It gets even worse when he ""awkwardly"" struggles to get his hand down inside her tight shorts and he....you guessed it....""awkwardly"" can't figure out where to rest his hand once inside her shorts. And, as you can imagine in this mess, then it is Sweeney's turn to do the same thing to his ass. They tried so hard to ""play awkward"" that it never worked. Unbelievable and embarrassingly stupid. You have to blame the writers, then the director, then the actress who was self-producing this dreck. But I also blame Powell. He should have trusted his instincts and known this would come off bad. He should have refused this hideous ""bit"". It doesn't make the audience laugh. The scene goes from eye-roll to cringe fest.And then it went from bad to worse when he chucked off his clothes and she examined him for spiders. Could have been a funny bit but once again, they leaned in too hard and beat the joke to death.Poor writing with adolescent dialogue throughout. When you can't write, you throw in crude language. It doesn't make it ""real"", it makes it lame. Perhaps they felt the Gen Z'ers would relate to using cuss words in every single sentence. But it just made every character seem uneducated and stupid. Someone gift those writers with a thesaurus.The rest of the cast was wasted in such a poorly constructed film. I hope they enjoyed their trip to Australia and the paychecks because that is all they are taking away from this experience.I was looking forward to this film. Such a disappointment. But the dog was good.Oh, and yeah, Sydney Sweeney IS the producer.~alwaysfuelingthefire rated 3/10 on 25 December 2023"," Cute couple moments, but background characters and story fell short: We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school.~alyetc rated 5/10 on 28 December 2023"," Cute movie: Movie was cute, but not one of Glen Powell's finest roles. He is worthy of better casting. The movie relies heavily on using the word f""""k which didn't work to make the movie funny. They also tried to use nudity to make you laugh. IMO if you have to curse and be naked to make someone laugh, you have a poor director. Also, Sydney Sweeney's voice just sounded off on screen. I don't know if she always sounds nasal, or if it was just in this movie. The plot was cute, but the characters needed enhancing. All in all, this is one to watch at home on one of the streaming services instead of spending the money on movie tickets.~bczzkjgd rated 5/10 on 31 December 2023"

Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies.

Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," Poor Things Emma Stone's Mesmerizing Resurrection: ""Poor Things"" is a spellbinding tale that catapults the audience into the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist, Dr. Godwin Baxter.

This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.~Lepidopterous_ rated 9/10 on 8 December 2023"," A Film not a movie, powerful, discomforting, unique, splendidly difficult and high craft throughout: This is not a film for the faint of heart nor the prudish. A bold film recalling us with consuming set designs, subtle changes in bold costuming across scenes, a cinematic score, surrealistic elements in London, magical realism in Lisbon, philophical noir on a ship and harsh yet poetic reality in Paris. Emma Stone is brilliant throwing herself into this role with studied abandon. Defoe and Ruffalo are strong.This is at root a film about femine spirit freed of societies embedding of politeness, being proper and pretty. How might it be if we shook the tree by getting out of woman's way? Caring or cruel?If you love film, this is must view art. If a movie goer seeking traditional plot lines, clean character arcs and familiar tropes; wait until you can stream this at home. Thus you can turn it off 30 minutes in and review the film here. Enjoy.~jtscheduling rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Poor Things is defiantly original, both visually striking and though provoking in equal measure - a true cinematic masterpiece: ""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!~laurenspierre rated 10/10 on 19 October 2023", Unforgivingly Bizarre and chaotic but endearing: The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates.~Camerenth rated 9/10 on 15 December 2023," A Bizarre Masterpiece: If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.~aciessi rated 9/10 on 24 December 2023"," Lanthimos at his most charming: Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.~drownsoda90 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling: I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time.

Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew.

At least once a year so that would be at least seventeen (17) times now. Great songs, a superb cast from top to bottom, heartwarming romances, and of course a must see ""FEEL GOOD"" ending.It is most deserving of a perfect 10 for 10 IMDB rating.~Ed-Shullivan rated 10/10 on 12 December 2020"," Filled with Whimiscal Characters and Heartwarming Stories,: Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. Best Performance: Bill Nighy~lesleyharris30 rated 10/10 on 1 January 2016"," Surprisingly Enjoyable: I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.~milareppa rated 9/10 on 6 April 2004"," A deeply loving film rich in character: It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)~bzb2001 rated 10/10 on 28 November 2004"," Delightfull Homage to Love: In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love.

""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie.

The film stars an ensemble cast.The film revolves around eight couples and their tryst with love.A pleasant and heart warming film and the best part of the film is that despite of a huge number of cast every character is been given the equal weightage and importance and it doesn't feels that if any of the story is left incomplete or not been given equal importance.Acting is superb and almost all the characters were chosen wisely and acted perfectly.Screenplay of the film is very simple and straight and probably a little drawback of the film as the film becomes too predictable.

But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Duplex."" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick ""pick me up"" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.~jackburden rated NA on 19 December 2004"," Unshamedly sentimental, but a very well-done film!: Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film.

Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually...Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her!

I really enjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way.

Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 23 November 2003"," Masterful comedy/family flick: Seen this classic so many times and never ceases to get old.

And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone.

He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 18 February 2003"," The perfect Christmas film: Home Alone is one of the best slapstick comedies I have ever seen.The comedy is top-notch, the slapstick is fantastic.It's not just that, the direction, editing, and pacing are immaculate.And obviously Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern are phenomenal here, I can't imagine them being played by anyone else, they are just perfect.Some of these edits wouldn't be in films like this today.But this movie is also delightful, dare I say even a little heartwarming, it's the perfect Christmas movie to watch every year.I'm gonna give Home Alone an A+.~mrashtastic89 rated 10/10 on 11 December 2021"," The Best Christmas Film of the Past 20 Years: ""Home Alone"" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 4 November 2000"," Culkin Really Shines Here: But don't forget about the presence of Stern and Pesci as bumbling comedic antagonists as Culkin is Kevin.

But I recently found out it wasn't, and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible. Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article ""Inside the Making of â Home Aloneâ's Fake Gangster Movie"" by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.~safenoe rated 10/10 on 18 December 2016"," Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal!: In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 7/10 on 14 December 2006"," Wonderful!: I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 5 May 2009"

I'm a big fan of SRK, so I really wanted to go. Here's what I liked and disliked about the movie. The movie had a really good soundtrack and it was nice to hear in the theater. The characters had good personalities and good reasons to go to London. I loved that Tapsee Pannu, an all around actress was there in the film. Sukhi(Vicky Kaushal)'s presence was so meaningful and I was sad to see him go. That leads me into what I disliked about the movie. Sukhi's funeral and Hardy(SRK) deciding to go to London by Dunki is what closed out the first half, which was a barrel of laughter and everyone in the theater including us was laughing so hard. The second half is their journey to London, so it got serious and went really slow that I wanted to sleep at one point. But that's how Raju sir's films are.

Apart from that, Bollywood has never explored such a unique plot. Now, coming back to the movie, ""Dunki"" is a decent entertainer with a great first half and a weak second half. The screenplay is engaging until the first half; after that, it falters. This is the only weakest point of ""Dunki."" The music is outstanding and fits perfectly into the scenes. The dialogues are well-written. SRK, Taapsee, and others have done a tremendous job. Overall, it's a great entertainer for the festive season.

It's hard to recall if I ever laughed this hard in a theatre, to a point where I was choking on my own breath.Raju Hirani approaches his comedic scenes like Quentin Tarantino - instead of throwaway one liners, he dedicates upto 10 mins to set up a single joke before landing it perfectly, while maintaining the pacing - not a single downtime throughout.He doesn't shy away from showing the opposite side of the spectrum, when the script demands the movie to go dark, it goes all the way without hesitation, sometimes even testing it's PG-13 rating.It's hard to hold ones ground when you are beside the overwhelming screen presence of SRK, but Vicky Kaushal does it effortlessly - standout performance.When the credits roll, you really feel like you have gone on a journey with these characters and shared the highs and lows of life with them.Only flaws I can point out is there are a couple of forgivable tonal inconsistencies and, this isn't a flaw, rather a personal preference - I would have liked if they shot this movie on film rather than digital cameras, the asthetic of the script demanded it.Summing it up Dunki is an emotional rollercoaster, an absolute winner and the most satisfying conclusion to this historic year for SRK.~jacksongaming-80094 rated 10/10 on 21 December 2023", The one who can relate will love this.: Hirani nailed it.

It is mainly focused on type of person who wants to goto foreign. It is so true that many people want to goto foreign and have a lavish lifestyle but failed to do so.

Chechik,John Hughes,The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big disaster.," The Cast Makes This One So Special: National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) *** (out of 4) The third film in the series has Clark (Chevy Chase) deciding to stay home and instead of going anywhere he invites all the family over for the holidays and sure enough nothing goes right. I must admit that I enjoyed the previous two films more than this one but there's still enough laughs here to make this one well worth seeing. I think the film certainly has some flaws in it but when there are so many laughs you really can't complain too much. I think Chase is in fine form as he goes more over-the-top here than in the previous installments. He's so wild here that at times he seems like he's playing a cartoon character. This certainly isn't a bad thing as Chase can handle this type of comedy but there were a few too many slapstick scenes early on. I think what really makes this film so memorable is the terrific supporting cast. Beverly D'Angelo is just fine as the supporting wife but we get terrific work from Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Juliette Lewis, John Randolph, William Hickey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Mae Questel. The stand out however has to be Randy Quaid returning as Cousin Eddie. The actor really does a terrific job bringing this character to life and the comic timing is just flawless no matter what he's doing. There are so many classic scenes here that it's hard to pick out the best but some of the highlights include the cat sequence, the walk through Wal Mart, the hilarious dog-under-the-table and of course the first appearance of Eddie.~Michael_Elliott rated NA on 20 December 2012"," Best Vaction/Christmas Movie: Poor Clark Griswold, no matter how optimistic he is, his family vacations always seem to go severely wrong. First time around he went across America in a metallic pea Station Wagon and it ended in disaster. Then they went across Europe and met similar, albeit much less funny, results.For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Griswolds, Clark is food additives expert who works for a company that doesn't appreciate him. He sets high standards for holiday events that no one can live up to and is notorious for dragging his grudging family along on every painstaking detail of every scheme. His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is the voice of reason, who keeps the family rooted in reality and responds with frequent deadpan bewilderment to his constant disasters. The long-suffering kids, Russ and Audrey (Johnny Galecki and a very young Juliette Lewis) have turned into the living embodiment of pure cynicism, but there's no talking any sense into Clark Griswold. Ever! But now Clark just wants to stay at home in the snowy Chicago suburbs for a 'fun, old-fashioned, family Christmas' and he's going to let nothing stop him. His enthusiasm for the holidays manages to infect the audience and you'll be rooting for him the whole way. He's an anti-Scrooge and if you're having a Christmas crisis then you need to watch this movie. Any disasters can be overcome.But that's easier said than done. He didn't bargain on bickering family members (including the voice of Betty Boop, Mae Questel, as a senile old aunt), a house covered in non-working Christmas lights, a seriously over-cooked turkey, snotty Yuppie neighbors making fun of him or Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his hickabilly family turning up unannounced to sponge some Christmas cheer off him.What stops it from being just another generic Christmas movie is a brilliant script by John Hughes packed full of hilarious set-pieces and perfect comic timing from Chevy Chase. He's a great actor but his appeal sadly declined in the 90s when he refused to evolve into more serious roles like Bill Murray did. Clark Griswold and Fletch are probably his most famous roles and this Vacation is definitely one you need to take.It's hard to pick the best moments but Randy Quaid's sudden appearance will make you grin a mile wide, a cat wrapped up in a box (with Happy Birthday paper!) that meets an unfortunate end and 'an asshole in his bathrobe emptying a chemical toilet into the sewer' are just plain brilliant. But what gives Christmas Vacation something more that makes it so much more special that all the other Christmas movies is that wonderful theme song! It's absolutely brilliant! But that ain't the only great tune the film as to offer. There are also some classic songs by Ray Charles, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry.Although not the best of the bunch (Harold Ramis' direction had an evil edge to the first film that made it just that little bit better), this film has become a Yuletide classic and must be watched every year. Since Christmas is full of annual traditions this film is definitely one you should add to the list. It would criminal to give it anything less that the highly coveted 10/10.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 10/10 on 14 November 2000"," A wonderful comedy and Christmas movie: This is probably the best Vacation film to come from the National Lampoon series.  There are so many laughs to go around (thanks to writer John Hughes) that it boggles the mind (and it might be the final time Checy Chase brings belly laughs).  Here, the Griswalds don't go on a vacation, but instead the family stays in Chicago where there relatives come to town and hell will come too.  Randy Quaid makes this film a treat by having just laugh out loud moments on the screen.  Great fun for the whole family (I think).

At least at the brink of madness at times. Chevy Chase as Mr. Griswold .. not few will remember those names.

Some jokes may be a bit .. well don't be too woke about certain things or too PC. Also yes some are just plain silly and there is a lot of don't try this at home stuff. It's a movie, try to accept it (like when Chevy is in the attic and sets his chair in the one spot where it makes no sense at all, other than to get a laugh out of the audience).So great cast and good natured humor. What else do you need?~kosmasp rated 9/10 on 9 June 2020"," The Perfect Holiday Comedy: The Griswold family is set to celebrate the holidays like never before, in `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,' directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes.  Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or he's `in it up to here').  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to the mountains to find the perfect `Griswold family Christmas tree.  And it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun. 	Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up unexpectedly in the `RV' they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark expected, or wanted, to see.  `Eddie,' he tells him, `I couldn't be more surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.'  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases try to elude) the deadly invader. 	A terrific cast was assembled for this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through your own `special' holiday season.  I rate this one 10/10.~jhclues rated 10/10 on 15 August 2000"," Merrry Christmas from Chevy Chase!: I don't know how anyone could ever go in life without seeing Christmas Vacation, it's one of the necessary movies you have to watch during the holidays. The reason being is that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. Who hasn't had their crazy family over during the holiday season? Well, that's Christmas Vacation, one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You think that Vacation topped it off with the laughs, believe me when I say that you've seen nothing yet. With an all star cast that clicked so well, you couldn't go wrong going on a great Christmas Vacation with the Griswolds.Clark Griswold has really got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed that. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Art and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. But in spite of all the good intentions and careful planning, Christmas plans start to go awry: crazy squirrels, SWAT teams, burning Christmas trees, an over cooked turkey and of course a visit from the world's favorite white trash with a heart of gold Cousin Eddie! A Christmas ride not to be missed with the Griswold family.One of the things I just adore about this movie is the little touches they put in the film: the grandparents falling asleep to an old Christmas movie playing on TV, the anxiety you feel as the doorbell rings knowing who's going to be behind it, and the little awkwardness during dinner when you hear everyone chewing their food. Chevy Chase is still such a pervert of course going for the hot sales lady instead of Cristy Brinkley this time, but you can't help but love and laugh at his fantasy in the back yard while the whole family is swimming in his most wanted work bonus: a family sized pool. He maybe a crazy pervert at times, but you feel the love he has for his family and how badly he wants Christmas to be perfect.There are some great laughs in this movie: a squirrel gets caught in the Christmas tree that Clark brings in and it attacks the family and neighbors! Clark gets upset that there is no Christmas bonus so his cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss, wraps him in a bow and gives him to Clark so he could kick him in the butt! A cat chews on the Christmas lights and gets electrocuted under the chair. But if you also get past all the slap stick humor, you still feel the Christmas message at the end, that despite all the craziness that comes around Christmas, don't forget what it's really about: peace and love. A wonderful ending and a perfect movie for Christmas that I watch every year, Christmas Vacation is definitely in Santa's movie collection somewhere.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 19 January 2004"," Holidays are only complete with this movie: My Christmas is filled with ritual, as I guess most people's are. Part of that ritual is National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, about which I have nothing but good things to say. This should be part of your Holiday season too, because despite it not seeming like it all the way through, the film as a whole is just so thoroughly festive, cheery and good-hearted.It opens with a great set-piece, Clark taking his family out in the ""front-wheel drive sleigh"" to dig their Christmas tree out of the snow-covered ground. He's a desperate loser, but you have to love the guy, working his butt off to give his extended family the perfect Christmas. (That's the difference in this Vacation movie, by the way - the Griswolds don't go anywhere, their folks come to them).So the shenanigans finding a tree set the pattern for a season of chaos, fighting in-laws, squirrels, stupid relatives, huge dogs, snooty neighbours and collapsing turkeys. And as if that wasn't stress enough for poor Clark, he's waiting for his Christmas bonus to come through to cover a cheque he's already written.The script brims with festive jollity, enthusing the audience with Clark's excitement for the holidays. Stand out moments include the welcome (and hilarious) return of Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, the uber-hick sponger with a trailer-full of weirdo kids and rubber sheets, and Mae Questel's appearance as Aunt Bethany. She used to voice Betty Boo, and plays the crazy old woman to perfection.See this movie. Get it on video. I normally watch it the first time on a miserable October Sunday, when I start to think properly about Christmas. Nothing can replace this movie as the one thing guaranteed to get me looking forward to late December. Fabulous stuff, and as festive for me as tinsel and carols. Cuddle up with this one.~cmqp rated NA on 31 December 2002"," Oh, what fun it is....: A comedy with laughs is good.  A comedy with feel-good laughs is better.A comedy like ""Christmas Vacation"" is great.When the Griswolds go on vacation, disaster is a certainty.  But staying home to celebrate Christmas with some far-flung relatives (who obviously weren't flung far enough) leaves room for not only some top-drawer fun but also time to reflect on family, love, goodwill, belief in one's self....Who expected so much from Chevy Chase?After watching ""Christmas Vacation"", you will.Nine stars.  And when you light up your house this Christmas, make sure there's a nuclear reactor nearby.~Mister-6 rated 9/10 on 19 August 1999"," Silly and predictable, but funny: It mayn't be one of my favourite Christmas movies, but it is one of the funnier ones for me. I agree some of it is silly, and when I say silly I mean silly, and the story is really quite predictable. But it at least looks good with some nice cinematography and scenery, and the music is fine too. The script has many funny moments and the sight gags while silly are respectable. The direction is competent and the performances from Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo are likable while Randy Quaid gives some great relief as a decidedly obnoxious relative. So in conclusion, no masterpiece but it is entertaining, that's what matters to me. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 25 September 2010"
Barbie (2023) - IMDb,6.9,Margot Robbie|Ryan Gosling|Issa Rae|Kate McKinnon|Alexandra Shipp|Emma Mackey|Hari Nef|Sharon Rooney|Ana Cruz Kayne|Ritu Arya|Dua Lipa|Nicola Coughlan|Emerald Fennell|Simu Liu|Kingsley Ben-Adir|Ncuti Gatwa|Scott Evans|John Cena,Greta Gerwig,Greta Gerwig|Noah Baumbach,Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.," Beautiful film, but so preachy: Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.~LoveofLegacy rated 6/10 on 21 July 2023"," A Hot Pink Mess: Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.~aherdofbeautifulwildponies rated 6/10 on 26 July 2023"," 3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.: The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!~imseeg rated 7/10 on 22 July 2023"," As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.: As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.~ramair350 rated 10/10 on 31 July 2023"," Too heavy handed: As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.~Natcat87 rated 6/10 on 22 July 2023"," Well this really did come as a surprise.: It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 21 July 2023"," Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.~Revuer223 rated 6/10 on 23 July 2023"," It was depressing: I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.~coxaneesa rated 8/10 on 24 July 2023"," My mom and I saw this yesterday. Here are my thoughts.: I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.~G-Joshua-Benjamin rated 6/10 on 21 July 2023"," The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie: I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.~MissSimonetta rated 4/10 on 20 July 2023"
A Christmas Story (1983) - IMDb,7.9,Peter Billingsley|Melinda Dillon|Darren McGavin|Scott Schwartz|Jean Shepherd|Ian Petrella|Tedde Moore|R.D.

He wants nothing more than a Red Ryder Ranger Model Air Rifle (a BB gun for short) for Christmas but everyone tells him it will ""shoot your eye out"".That's about it for plot but the film has sequences that every child (and adult) can relate to. My favorites: Ralphie's best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he's dared to lick it; Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father; the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up (in a GREAT scene); Ralphie's constant fights with his little brother (wonderfully played by Ian Petrella) and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents-- especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It's now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever made--right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (which was also ignored at its release).A charming, wonderful Christmas film. A 10 all the way!~preppy-3 rated 10/10 on 23 December 2004"," A timeless movie that will never get old: A Christmas Story, there is absolutely no way that anyone could ever say they never saw this film since it's shown every Christmas, especially on TNT when they do the 24 hours of A Christmas Story, lol. But onto the movie, I've watched A Christmas Story since the day I was born, it's one of those films you never get sick of because of the simple fact that each year of your life you could relate to it in some way. Each character has these memorable moments and you could say that you've been in the same situation. It's great seeing this movie because it makes us laugh about the silliest moments in our life during the Christmas season.Ralphie is a little boy who just so badly wants a B.B. gun for Christmas, it's just his dream. Only one problem, it'll shoot his eye out according to the adults around him. We go through Christmas with Ralphie and his family, his father who is obsessed with a prize leg lamp he won. His mother who is greatly under-appreciated but extremely loving. His brother, Randy, who is your typical silly and annoying younger brother who makes fun of him. And his friends who are on a constant run from the school bully. But all Ralphie can think about during this hard time in his adolescence is that B.B. gun.A Christmas Story has constant unforgettable scenes, like the pink bunny out fit that Ralphie gets as a present from his aunt, him saying his first swear in front of his dad, Mom and Dad's fight over using the glue on purpose, visiting Santa at the mall, and of course that great ending that is sure to bring a that is sure to bring a tear to your eye. It's just the perfect Christmas movie that is a BIG recommendation for the season. It has great comedy, terrific acting, and just the most touching moments you'll ever see in a Christmas movie.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 16 November 2003"," Christmas Classic: A Christmas Story touches my heart as does no other film, and I know the reason for this is because it reminds me so much of my own 1950's boyhood. For sure it strikes a nerve in persons of my generation. This is Bob Clark's masterpiece and I know I am not the only person who feels this way. I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, chances are you have seen the film; indeed, probably have seen it countless times as I have. This is not a film review in the normal sense. It is more a reminiscence and appreciation of a great story captured for all time in moving pictures which, in turn, captured the essence of the time and place of its setting; that time and setting being a typical town in Indiana during Christmas season in the 1940s as we observe a typical family (the Parkers) with two young sons named Ralphie and Randy. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate very well to the story's key elements. I recall vividly family outings to crowded downtown sidewalks, Mom and Dad squeezing in a season's worth of shopping in one day and doing it under the nose of one who had a visit to Santa Claus on his mind. Staring at the prominent HIGBEES sign in the downtown square, I could almost see the words John A. Brown in its place. Browns was the main department store in my hometown of Oklahoma City and the place where I would make my annual visit with Santa Claus.I am sure most who have seen the film realize this is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon as the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work. The stove in the Parker's kitchen reminds much of the one my grandmother had, and the rest of the house reminded me of the home my other grandparents lived in. As you see, viewing A Christmas Story is always a magical experience for me. It is almost as if Mr. Clark made this film with Tom Fowler in mind. There are so many comments to make. It will be impossible to relate them all in a short review, but here are some that I know people my age will be most familiar with:Beautiful toys displayed in department store windows. The agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. I could go on and on. I will make two more observations and then will sign off and let somebody else speak.In the film's sweetest scene, we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's (ably played by Peter Billingsley) face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments. But, for me the best moment was the last. Ralphie is in bed at film's end. We see snow outside and Ralphie dreaming of his wonderful gift, as the story's author and narrator Jean Shepherd, speaking as the grown up Ralphie, realizes this was the best Christmas he ever had, or ever would have.If you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story, you are perhaps unaware that you have cheated yourself. Buy or rent the 2003 20th anniversary DVD. It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas.~Tommy-5 rated 10/10 on 8 December 2005"," Classic Christmas film that doesn't age: Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas but his mother is totally against it - the ""you'll shoot your eye out"" discussion being a major opposition.This is essentially a story about childhood and is very spot-on in regards to the yearning of children and the whole Christmas era - I've been watching it since I was a child and every Christmas when it comes on TV I watch it again. It's funny, poignant and totally memorable - it has some of the best scenes of all-time and although I know a few people who dislike it because it's a bit ""weird"" and ""dark,"" most people I know love it.Worth watching every Christmas, forever!~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 13 December 2004"," A timeless Christmas film: ""A Christmas Story"" is a rare film about children yet for adults.  While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmas-themed saga, adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated, polysyllabic narration of Ralphie, filled with nostalgia and lucid memories, and the soft, high-pitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word.  The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film, but a character wholly outside the story, reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes.  Yet he is the heart of the film, the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Clause and a BB gun - it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke.  To that end, ""A Christmas Story"" is flawless.""A Christmas Story"" tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he searches for the golden, upheld idol of all red-blooded American boys:  A Red Rider Air Rifle.  Ralphie spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it - including an essay, a trip to Santa Claus and more.  The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family - his irritable, foul-mouthed father with a good heart, his whiny brother Randy, and his sweet, all-American mother.  It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes, but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film.  The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story.  He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment, Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing - only to have Billingsley note in his awe-filled, high-pitched voice that ""I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun.  It's very good for Christmas."" (paraphrased).  Most of the humor is similar - the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also, there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season - it's a movie everyone can relate to.  There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power.  I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child - in this case, the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously, ""A Christmas Story"" is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane.  It simply excels at its simple goals, and comes together as an extraordinarily entertaining piece of cinema.~JPTaylor rated 9/10 on 22 December 2003"," Christmas is Not Complete Without Watching This: The 1983 ""Terms of Endearment"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Now it was deserved. The film still remains popular today. What's hard to believe now is that ""A Christmas Story"" (released the same year) was ignored everywhere. If anything it should of been nominated for best adapted screenplay!Now when the film was released it was ""Critically Acclaimed"" but, MGM failed to capitalized on that. The film was poorly handled & failed to capture a large theatrical audience!Well thanks to the Home Video Market & television this film has now become part of Americana. It also helped that Ted Turner made ""24 Hours Of A Christmas Story"" an annual event.It is now 2017, and ""A Christmas Story"" it is now one of the most popular films of all time. Even ""Return of the Jedi"" ( The Highest Grossing Film of 1983) ""Isn't gaining as many new fans"". .""Return of the Jedi"" has always rode the coattails of the earlier ""Star Wars"" films. ""A Christmas Story"" has gained fans for just being a great film!Now my reviewSet in the 1940's the film makes you identify with Ralphie and you your routing for him in every single way!Ralphie is in elementary school. His has a little brother and all he wants for Christmas is a BB-Gun. He wants this more than anything. Before Christmas gets there he has many obstacles to overcome. One of them is getting home! He & his friends are always being bullied before they can make it home. The film is flawless. It is a joy to watch and only improves every time you watch it. It is also true that for some reason the older it gets the better it becomes! You need to see this. Also there is a fan made documentary called ""A Christmas Story Documentary: Road Trip for Ralphie"". That is a great fan made documentary.~Sober-Friend rated 9/10 on 29 December 2017"," Pure joy!: How difficult is it to perfectly capture nostalgia? It must be pretty darn difficult or else everyone would make movies like this. It may not be absolute perfection but Jean Shepherd, Bob Clark and the outstanding cast came as close as anyone here.Creating a story centered around nostalgia is a tricky thing as the memories that creates it are unique to each of us. The themes, however, are similar and that's where the success lies.I didn't want a Red Ryder BB gun when I was that age but my Christmas wish was just as fervent and I schemed just as hard as Ralphie. The bully at my school didn't have yellow eyes but he was pretty much like Scut Farkus. And so on, from the fantastically flawed parents to the pop-heroes, A Christmas Story captures it all.Truly wonderful.~CMUltra rated 9/10 on 25 December 2005"," This one bears up to repeated: Unlike many people, I don't particularly like seeing movies more than once. Of course there are some exceptions, but I am not a person who usually sees a movie again and again--I find this very boring. However, there are several exceptions--and this movie probably heads the list. Unlike other films this one actually becomes better with repeated viewings--and it's great to see and hear the wonderful and silly lines again--especially when they are are friends and family there to see it and laugh along with you. Perfect writing (albeit, very, very cynical), wonderful acting, great attention to details (the 1940s look to the film is great--down to the boxes of soap and radio programs) and so many funny and sentimental moments make this a perennial favorite. If you haven't seen this then get out from under your rock and see it! If you don't like it, then think about getting psychiatric help! No sane person could hate this wonderful film.~planktonrules rated 10/10 on 28 November 2009"," The funniest, most touching family Christmas film of ALL time!: I lived the life of Ralphie!

This movie brings out the true essence of Christmas happiness.  Everyone, young and old, can relive the magic of being a child.Ralphie's vibrant imagination and inventiveness in his ploys to seduce his parents into buying him the ultimate gift are ""pinch-his-chubby-cheeks"" adorable.

Seaman,"On the outskirts of Whoville lives a green, revenge-seeking Grinch who plans to ruin Christmas for all of the citizens of the town."," 5.6??? Sorry but I thought the film was surprisingly good!: Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 9 September 2009"," This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made: How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the city of Whoville which is filled with Whos. One day a grinch is accidentally delivered there and tries to understand their ways and love for Christmas but fails and comes to loath it. He moves into the far mountains of Whoville and becomes a hermit. When a little girl knocks on his door and tries to get him in the Christmas spirit he decides to take his hate for Christmas out on the locals. Can anyone or anything stop him?This movie is directed by icon Ron Howard (Splash) and stars Jim Carrey (Liar Liar), Clint Howard (The Waterboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Christine Baranski (Chicago), Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Taylor Momsen (Gossip Girls).Everything about this movie is perfect. The universe is perfectly created and thoroughly captures your imagination. The backdrops, sets and props are stupendous. The costumes, makeup and hairstyles were a lot of fun. Jim Carrey delivers an amazing performance. His dialogue, mannerisms and facial expressions are awesome. The storyline is well written and I loved the way it explains how the Grinch arrived, his childhood, his current state and his evolution. How can you not love Max and the ending was perfect. Even the soundtrack is good.Overall, this is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 10/10 on 24 December 2022"," Every Year I Like It a Little More: The Grinch hates Christmas, then steals it!When this first came out I liked the original version much more, but as time goes on I'm finding myself preferring this version more and more. Perhaps it's because Jim Carey's portrayal is more relatable, or perhaps I'm more impressed with the visuals and production value than I once was, or maybe I just understand the adult jokes more. Whatever the reason, this is a fantastic adaptation.What stands out above all is Jim Carey's performance, followed by the sets and costumes. It is an unforgettable experience that might never be replicated again.While kids may prefer the original, certainly this will be all the adults most preferred version of the Grinch.~jordyntsmith rated 8/10 on 4 December 2023"," No Kidding, It was Great! Wassup with you guys????: Well, I finally broke down and went to see it.  I was hesitant after reading all the pans here.  Egad!   It was a great movie! You can't compare it to the ""original"" any more  than you can compare ""Scrooge"" to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes (obviously impromptu) were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as over-blown as I had expected.  As for the  ""prequel"" portion, well, it was only so-so. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the ""Ah hoo torres"" song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.

However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child.  A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.~bob the moo rated NA on 26 December 2003"," A Christmas favorite: One of my all time favorite Christmas movies.The grinch is hilarious, the older you get the more relatable it gets.

Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie ""Yes Man"" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show ""Gossip Girl"" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now. This movie also stars Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans, and Mindy Sterling.

Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.~jennifer-99 rated 10/10 on 27 November 2000"

The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close.~aharmas rated 10/10 on 29 October 2023"," One of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as one of the best of the year: Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it.~darkreignn rated 9/10 on 29 October 2023"," Throwback filmmaking.: Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it.~dtswpod rated 8/10 on 6 November 2023"," ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie: It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly.

Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+~evanston_dad rated 10/10 on 20 November 2023"," entre nous: Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 8/10 on 8 November 2023"," One of the best movies of the year.: ""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham.~JohnDeSando rated NA on 16 November 2023"," Alexander Payne makes the proverbial ""return to form"": The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug).~Quinoa1984 rated 10/10 on 30 October 2023"," The Holdovers is a New Cult Classic: Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year.~jjgonzalez-06426 rated 9/10 on 31 October 2023"
The Family Plan (2023) - IMDb,6.3,Mark Wahlberg|Michelle Monaghan|CiarÃ¡n Hinds|Zoe Colletti|Van Crosby|Iliana Norris|Vienna Norris|Maggie Q|Joyner Lucas|Kellen Boyle|Felicia Pearson|Lateef Crowder|Miles Doleac|Jonny Coyne|SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui|Kash Abdulmalik|Colby Burton|Al Vicente,Simon Cellan Jones,David Coggeshall,A former top assassin living incognito as a suburban dad must take his unsuspecting family on the run when his past catches up to him.," Apple beefing up its original movies with a solid typical streaming type of movie: Part action, part comedy, here comes a Mark Wahlberg movie that is both typical for this actor, but also something you likely saw (or close to) in the past. That said, its 2023 and almost everything has been done already, so the real question is this. Is it well done this time? Is it fun? And the answer is yes.The movie take a bit of inspiration in True Lies but put its own spin on family road trip comedy with some ""We are the Millers"" vibe, while injecting some decent action sequences in there.Having a runtime of 2 hours make sure the movie put enough emphasis on the familly relations and developing its characters, wich can be a definite plus, but at the same time i felt the movie dragged a tiny bit in the first half. Maybe 10-15 minutes could had been cut. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment.Mark Wahlberg is definately in pretty solid shape still, wich make his character completely credible, but he ain't no martial artist so seeing him go toe to toe with Lateef Crowder (a Copeira expert) did showcase some of his shortcoming. That said, that scene was meant as a mix of comedy and action and not to be taken too seriously so for most peoples who are not martial arts afficionados, it should not be a problem. The rest of the action including gun scenes were well done.Michelle Monaghan is also pretty solid in her role as the mom of the familly. Charming and charismatic. The kids also got to have enough screen time and developement that they felt usefull and interesting in the story. Every character pretty much as its own arc.Overall its a movie that i taught was pretty enjoyable on a first watch. It is a mix between comedy and action but at the same time since it never fully commit to either side, you can't say its a super funny comedy or a big action movie. It is a bit of everything and it makes for a good story tough.Ultimately not every movie is meant to be watch multiple times and considering Apple TV+ has a pretty limited selection of mainstream original movies (Ghosted being one of the few great ones), it is a welcome addition that both casual viewers and cinephile should enjoy.~destroyerwod rated 7/10 on 16 December 2023"," Great action comdefy: While this is not a movie where you'll be amazed by the plot it sure delivers on both action and comedy fronts and sometimes that's all we need from a movie: to spend a good time laugfhingh and see good action.A popcorn movie?

It's ridiculous, sometimes annoying, and has poorly written bad guys. The plot is whatever you want it to be. There's no real story here. Just go with it.

There's product placement, but not too much. There's staggering violence, but it's all squeaky clean so it can be a Xmas movie. All the supporting cast is ethnic just the right amount. The family is flush with tremendous cash, which helps plot advancement as well as beautiful cinematography / scenes.It was very enjoyable, assuming enough suspension of disbelief. The whole thing is obviously very predictable, but it's executed nicely. Everybody but the teenage daughter is world-class level at something, so while it's promoting family values, it is, for a change, not promoting mediocrity.I watched this while cycling indoors, was perfect to get me through my winter workout.~roxlerookie rated 6/10 on 16 December 2023"," True Lies meets National Lampoon's Vacation: So there was some money left and no ideas. How easy is it just to remake a high scoring film but without the large budget. This is so copied from True Lies, even the main character has the same job and there is also the evil Asian woman. The ending with a show out against the baddies in an empty building, same. Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment.~hansefde rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Silly but well made, engaging, emtertaining feel-good actioner.

It's pure entertainment with no deeper value, but all performances are pitch perfect, David Coggeshall's screenplay is solid, and director Simon Cellan Jones splendidly pulls it all together. It's unadulterated fun.~danieljfarthing rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Not out of the ordinary, but entertaining...: I liked this. But....It is ground-breaking in concept? Absolutely not.Is the story something unexpected? Nope.Is Wahlberg's acting better? No. Same old Marky Mark,It is clichÃ©? Definitely.However, it is entertaining.I wasn't watching the clock during it or pausing it repeatedly. It held my attention in spite of a rather expected storyline. Action sequences were decent. And Monahan always does a good job. So in spite of some viewers complaining it's not the next great blockbuster, this film still delivers on entertainment.And while her part is VERY minor.. love me some Maggie Q.Minuscule adult oriented content (one, rather tame, scene), no nudity, very light on foul language. Violence is the greatest aspect - and due to the violence, I'd not suggest this for younger viewers. It's NOT a ""family film"" due to the violence.-----------------All that being posted.. and irrelevant to the actual storyline... it was VERY strange to see these optics from an Apple film... all these henchmen chasing down this white suburban family are black. Seriously, ALL the low-level street henchmen/killer were black.. the race dynamics were so, so prevalent they were readily apparent to me. And honestly, that's rarely anything I would notice.~NullUnit rated 8/10 on 19 December 2023"," Popcorn movie: I give this an 8 not because it is a great movie but, within its ""True Lies"" genre, it delivers. I tend to get bored with non-stop action movies that spurt blood constantly and have no actual human characters. While it's improbable that the average middle aged couple look like the two leads and the whole thing is completely unbelievable, it at least paints an outline of characters and the cast is kind of lovable in their own tropes. Adolescent angst, mom boredom - yeah, it's a bit pain-by-numbers...but it flew past and I didn't check my watch or wonder when is this gonna end already??? - which is about 90% of the time with the crap the streamers make. (See ""Leave the World Behind - no, honestly don't -should've been on the Sherwin Williams channel 'cause it was like watching paint dry!!). You want art? Go to a museum.

Nothing is special from this film presented by Apple. Mark Wahlberg tries his best here but can't save this film from sinking even though he stars and is a Executive Producer on. What is also dissapointing is the acting is very bad from everyone involved which is a surprise especially since this is a solid cast. Without spoiling to much of the plot point this reminded me of a cheap knockoff of True Lies in a way. You will know what I'm talking about when you watch this. The Family Plan gets failing grade from me with 4 stars out of 10.~djrmc24 rated 4/10 on 18 December 2023," Another generic movie, why??: A completely clichÃ© kind of movie: Some teenagers that are of course always in bad mood change into good kids while a James Bond imitating Mark Wahlberg safes his kidnapped family cause, you know, he was a killer. And how does his family react: Omg he is a killer! But wait we are family, so we need to love him right?Sorry for that but I can't endure anymore movies like The Family Plan.Mark Wahlberg's time is over, I don't even know when the last good movie came out with him starring. Apple wanted another movie (not that they made two movies over the last months for cinema) so the writers thought: wow let's make a funny romantic family action road trip drama movie, man I don't even know how many genres we want to integrate into this movie but it's gonna be awesome! And I have to say the first act isn't that bad. I quiet liked it actually, even if it was a little bit brainless. But what followed was a story that couldn't have been more boring. I don't want to see the classic ending shot where the protagonists walk out of a building with the police already waiting. I want to see a story with twists and turns but besides some left and right turns on the street the movie had nothing like this.

This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it~A_Different_Drummer rated 9/10 on 8 January 2016"," Sweet and charming, salvaged by the cast: Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly clichÃ© ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 7/10 on 31 December 2010"," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz: Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.~bob the moo rated NA on 16 November 2003"," A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...: Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****~moonspinner55 rated 7/10 on 23 December 2007"," An instant holiday classic: Ferrell's crowning achievement to date!: ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, Faizon Love, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, Peter Billingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic.

It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.~patriciogl10 rated 8/10 on 3 October 2019"," Elf Will Be A New Christmas Classic!: After seeing ""Elf"" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer.

Without a doubt.7 out of 10 Stars.~korch-3 rated 7/10 on 31 October 2003"," Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer: At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by NazgÃ»l-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10~pyrocitor rated 8/10 on 14 December 2015"," There's magic in the man in green.: The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him. At times, this can even bring on a tear of joy.~mark.waltz rated 10/10 on 21 December 2020"," WOW I forgot how great this film was: BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS.

The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 5 February 2009"," Yes, same plot, but it still gets the same laughs as the first one did if not more: Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun. It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York. Instead of complaining or panicking, he just plain enjoys it. He goes on the ultimate tour with his father's bag of money and credit cards and cons himself into the Plaza Hotel claiming he's there with his dad. But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital. But Kevin is going to make sure that they don't mess around with the kids and has set his uncle's abandoned apartment up for a fun house of traps.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was an absolute blast. The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?!""... the lady just smiles and says ""The finest in New York!"", it was just too funny! I love this movie and I'm always going to recommend it for a good watch, I think you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 23 November 2003"," I knew it was you, I could SMELL ya getting' off the elevata: Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.With a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.~CuriosityKilledShawn rated 9/10 on 7 May 2004"," Merry Christmas You Filthy Animals: I actually enjoy this one more than the first. Love seeing some of the iconic sites of New York City, and just what it looked like in 1992.A very similar formula to the first but obviously set in NYC, so there was a lot of potential for different ideas which I felt they capitalized on. Steady laughs throughout from all the characters. The addition of Tim Curry was amazing. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern crack me up in their roles as the Wet/Sticky Bandits.A very good sequel that delivers in pretty much every way, especially the Christmas feels.~Slarkshark rated 8/10 on 25 December 2020"," I love it!: ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.8/10~dee.reid rated 8/10 on 7 December 2005", Christmas classic: The first 2 home alone films are classics and i watch them ever year like a couple of times each a year since i was a kid and my honest opinion is that the second one is my favourite out of the 2 probably because is based in new york and as i'm not American seeing new york at Christmas is like a dream.~brandonrhewitt rated 10/10 on 13 October 2020," Same plot. Same actors. New traps. No problem.: Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same plot as the first movie, but Home Alone 2 is a very good sequel. The new traps for the Wet, er... Sticky Bandits are great. Once again Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances. Having Tim Curry in this was also a treat. There is a lot of enjoyment in this movie.~Op_Prime rated NA on 16 April 2000", Great sequel: This is one of the few times the sequel is better than the original. A classic Christmas movie. The house traps at the end are much better than the first movie too.

It brought back everything that happened in the first film. The same actors portrayed their roles wonderfully. A TERRIFIC storyline. It has laughter throughout the movie, love, thrilling moment and also blossoming friendships. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE!!!!! A++ Film.~dockerykelli rated 10/10 on 6 July 2019", The Best Film Of The Series In My Opinion.: This Time Kevin McCallister played once again by Macully Culkin is on a trip to Florida with his family. He follows the wrong person and ends up on a flight to New York. There The Wet Bandits Harry played by Daniel Stern and Marv played By Joe Pesci are on the loose and after Kevin.This is a better film than the first. John Hughs is a wonderful writer and has gone on to making and writing classic films such as Pretty In Pink with Jon Cryer. This is a very funny film with great casting and wonderful storyline. People dismiss this film but I love it because in the first film he is just Home Alone but in the second film HE IS IN NEW YORK!

White Christmas (1954) - IMDb,7.6,Bing Crosby|Danny Kaye|Rosemary Clooney|Vera-Ellen|Dean Jagger|Mary Wickes|John Brascia|Anne Whitfield|Bea Allen|Leon Alton|Al Bain|Frank Baker|Benjie Bancroft|Mary Bayless|Joan Bayley|Brandon Beach|Paul Bradley|Tex Brodus,Michael Curtiz,Norman Krasna|Norman Panama|Melvin Frank,A successful song-and-dance team become romantically involved with a sister act and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general.," "".........just like the ones we used to know."": By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derriÃ¨re and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.~bkoganbing rated 9/10 on 11 August 2005"," Excellent and timeless Christmas holiday movie: I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now. Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 18 November 2009"," Merry Christmas thanks to Irving Berlin: The music of Irving Berlin, one of America's most distinguished composers of the 20th century, is at the center of this pleasant holiday film, that if one is to judge by the comments submitted to this forum, is a perennial favorite of audiences that discover this charming movie, or just go back to visit from time to time.Directed by Michael Curtiz, a versatile man; he was at ease with drama as well as comedy, or musicals. He shows a light touch that helps make this a cherished film for movie fans of all ages. Based on material by another great team, Norman Panama, Norman Krasna and Melvin Frank, the movie is light as a feather. The film is sort of a variation on the theme, ""let's put on a show"", or even, ""if we stage it, they will come"", we know how it will end, but we feel good, and enjoy it even though we know the plot by heart.The main reason for watching, besides Mr. Berlin's wonderful tunes, is hearing those standard songs delivered by the likes of Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, who were at the top of their careers. They had such wonderful and melodious voices, they enhance the songs they interpret. The story is just a pretext to bring together the talented principals plus Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen, Dean Jagger, and the marvelous Mary Wickes, in a film that will delight anyone, anytime, but especially at Christmas.~jotix100 rated 7/10 on 18 January 2008"," Sometimes the audience knows better than the critics!: Over the years, I've read a number of professional critics' reviews of this film; almost all were mildly to severely negative.  And here's the interesting thing: I don't disagree with most of the individual carps. Yes, the movie is a piece of fluff. Yes,the usually dependable Danny Kaye is a bit weak in his performance. Yes, the plot mechanism for inserting many of the production numbers is lame.  Heck, even the continuity is poor...I myself have discovered three noticeable continuity fluffs. But here's the thing.  The movie works, anyway!!! Bing and Danny nevertheless make a likeable ""Mutt and Jeff"" duo. The supporting cast all holds their own, from a radiant (and surprisingly voluptuous) Rosemary Clooney, to the astoundingly agile Vera Ellen, to Dean Jagger's Patton-like General Waverly...they all hit their marks very well. The plot-line is unbelievable.  Who cares?  This is a feel-good Christmas Movie, for cryin' out loud!  The production numbers are sheer fun, the plot doesn't get in the way of all the beauty and great music, the actors are obviously having a good time, and we're all allowed to window-peep on the shenanigans.  This is the PERFECT movie to put on after Macy's Parade, while all those who don't like football are helping prep for the big Turkey Day meal.  You sneak a bit of dressing or cranberry sauce, and watch a production number.  The plot is so user-friendly, missing five minutes here and there doesn't hurt. Treat yourself.  Discover why millions of views have made this movie a holiday favorite, despite the critics' opinions!~djkent rated NA on 11 November 1999"," Count me in with the saps who absolutely love this movie.: ""White Christmas"" is guilty of many of the sins catalogued by other commentators: its got a sappy story line, predictable plot twists, it plays outrageously for sentiment and patriotism (not your usual Christmas theme!). But I confess to having loved it from the first moment I saw it nearly a half century ago.  I, too, like many, make it a point to view it every Christmas season, along with much better holiday fare such as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street."" 	I think, contrary to many folks, that Danny Kaye succeeds in the second lead role better than Fred Astaire did in ""Holiday Inn,"" and while he isn't given an opportunity for his patented zaniness, he adds a thoroughgoing charm to the role that sometimes the rather stiff Astaire lacks. 	Rosemary Clooney is lovely in the rather thankless role of the practical sister and was at the peak of her genius as a pop singer, Vera-Ellen does her usually charming thing, and Crosby!  The master implants his genius in virtually every frame.  In supporting roles veteran character actor Dean Jagger is splendid as the general, while Mary Wickes steals every scene she's in as the nosy hotel housekeeper, Emma. 	The singing and dancing are first-rate (even without Astaire), and the songs by Irving Berlin are among his very best, including a number of tunes written especially for the film.  One that never ceases to charm me is the trifle, ""Snow,"" sung by our four stars in the dining car of the railroad train bound from Florida to Vermont.  What a magical moment, among many in this thoroughly delightful, if flawed, jewel.~bobj-3 rated NA on 13 October 2001"," A classic Christmas film and top selling song of all time: Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas"" movie almost was a classic when it came out in 1954. That's because the title song had been out for 12 years, and was made hugely popular after its first use in the 1942 film, ""Holiday Inn."" It won the Oscar that year for best original song. The song already had broken sales records and was an annual Christmas favorite. So, even with as long as it took 20th Century Fox to make the film, the movie was seen as a sure-fire hit musical and comedy romance. The delay was mostly in trying to fill the role of Phil Davis, played by Danny Kaye. Fred Astaire declined the role and Donald O'Connor became ill just before shooting began. Perhaps providence had a hand in the delay, because I don't think any long-time movie buffs today could imagine anyone other than Danny Kaye in that role. The movie premiered Oct. 14, 1954, and became the top moneymaking film for the year. It had $12 million in box office sales (about $105 million in 2014 dollars). The second highest grossing film that year was ""The Caine Mutiny,"" at $8.7 million. Moreover, the record sales of the song continued to ring up. According to Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's recording of ""White Christmas"" holds the world record as the best- selling single recording of all time. As of 2014, Crosby's recording tops 50 million, and the total sales of ""White Christmas"" by all recordings tops 100 million. Today this movie endures, along with ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as the two 'must' original films on all lists for annual family viewing over the holidays. Without a doubt, this is the best musical of the season. Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" is the third movie that is on most lists for annual viewing; but viewers have a choice of several different renditions to choose from. Any of four of those are very good. What's not to like about ""White Christmas?"" It's a wonderful story of the early musical play versions where the entertainment is the profession of the stars. The plot is very good, with some sub-plots interwoven. It's a nice romance and light comedy of the everyday life variety. And it has wonderful music, singing and dancing. This film is packed with talent. It has 17 songs â all written by Irving Berlin, and several dance numbers. The songs are a mix of previous numbers and entirely new ones. Several were Berlin hits that are still played today. Some have been used or can be heard in movies in the 21st century. Besides ""White Christmas,"" these include ""Heat Wave,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" and ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me.""Kaye has a couple dance numbers and one with Vera-Ellen who shows her dance talent in several other numbers. Rosemary Clooney plays half of the Haynes sisters act (as Betty) with Vera-Ellen's Judy; and she's also the romance interest with Crosby. Other top cast members include veteran actors Dean Jagger, Mary Wickes and Sig Ruman. Two future stars are in the music and dance cast â Barrie Chase and George Chakiris. ""White Christmas"" has one of the wittiest funny lines of filmdom. Kaye as Phil says to Crosby's Bob Wallace, ""My dear partner. When what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting whatever it is you've got left."" Another good example of the comedic banter between the two male stars is later. Bob is talking about Phil to Ed Harrison (played by Johnny Grant). ""I have complete confidence in him. When it comes to conniving and finagling, you can't beat this boy.""This wonderful film never wears thin for viewing year after year. The songs and dance numbers will always entertain any audience. And the story is a nice holiday tale of friendship, romance, kindness and fun. It's a classic that families will enjoy for generations to come.~SimonJack rated 10/10 on 29 December 2014"," I'm dreaming of... WHITE CHRISTMAS!: I absolutely ADORE this movie!  Have since the first time I saw it! Sure... some may classify it as simply a ""feel-good"" movie, but what's wrong with that?  Some may also classify it as pure schmaltz, but the movie truly does have it's sad points... like the priceless look on General Waverly's face whenever he enters the room where everyone who had been under his division is awaiting his arrival!The movie has a truly wonderful musical score, not to mention some VERY kick butt dancing!Bing Crosby is charming as Bob Wallace, a calm and reserved, yet witty and delightful and wise-cracking, and somewhat cynical kind of guy. Bing truly performed to his greatest.  And his vocal talent is enormous, not to mention evident throughout the entire movie!  It's a real treat to see him crack up when he and Danny Kaye are performing their rendition of ""Sisters""!Danny Kaye is hilarious as Phil Davis, the foil to calm and cool Bob. Phil, too, is full of wise-cracks, and very intent on getting Bob to settle down. Danny gave such a life to his character, portraying him like no other! His best one liner was when a young blonde with voice like nails on a chalk board says to him (after his phoney engagment to Judy) ""I sure wish it would happen to me!"") to which he replies ""So do I!""Rosemary Clooney is absolutely riveting as Betty Haynes, the older of the two Haynes sisters.  She is the most calm and most subdued.  She is looking for her ""knight on the white horse"" in life.  Rosemary played Betty to the fullest, making her every bit as believable as you could imagine!  And that voice... GOLDEN!  A gift from God!  It's a true treasure to see her in her solo ""Love (You Didn't Do Right By Me)"".  She's absolutely marvelous and extremely talented.Vera-Ellen is refreshingly delightful as Judy Haynes, the younger and more naive Haynes sister.  Judy is also the dreamer of the two.  Vera-Ellen does a wonderfully through job of portraying Judy!  She is a perfect foil to her older sister.  And those dancing stems... to see her dance in numbers like ""Mandy"" and ""Choreography"" is a real treat!  How ANYONE could ever dance as well as she is beyond me!  She really did a great job in this movie, even better than her performance in ""On The Town"" with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Betty Garrett.A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  GREAT CAST CHEMISTRY!!!!  GREAT MUSIC!!!!  GREAT DANCING!!!!  WATCH IT AND YOU WILL SOON BE DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS!!!!~Sweet Charity rated 10/10 on 19 November 2000", Magic !: I have watched this movie countless times over the years and it remains my all-time favorite..

It is a great shame that Hollywood no longer makes movies of this quality .~Sisi rated 10/10 on 14 January 1999," If this isn't the all-time great Christmas movie, it's pretty close!: Sorry, Jimmy! My apologies, Alistair! My all-time favorite Christmas was, is, and always will be, ""White Christmas."" First of all, there's that wonderful Irving Berlin score. ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"" and ""Sisters"" have become standards, of course. But, towering above them all, is Bing Crosby's definitive performance of the beloved Christmas favorite that he practically owned. All the performances are top-drawer, what with Bing, Danny Kaye (In a role meant for Donald O'Connor), Rosie Clooney, Vera-Ellen, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes, who, as you can see here, was playing nasty old things even when she was a nasty young thing!Corny, syrupy, kitsch. Perhaps it is all of that, to some. But, to unashamed sentimentalists like me, ""White Christmas"" will always be THE all-time great Christmas movie, particularly when viewed by the whole family, on Christmas Day, in front of the fireplace.God bless Bing, Berlin, and company, for making a lot of Holidays that much happier, including those of the Sorrentino family!~BobLib rated NA on 24 September 1999"," This Is Definitely My Favorite of the Classic Holiday Films!: I know, we've heard it all before, how the film, Holiday Inn is superior to this offering, but you'd never convince me of that!  I adore this film, it's fun, innocent, lively, has wonderful tunes and a top-notch cast.  My holiday viewing will never be complete until I've watched this film at least a half dozen times and probably more during the holiday season.  It's one of those 'feel good films' and this Christmas fanatic highly recommends settling in with some good snacks and simply enjoying yourself and this true holiday classic.  The DVD is a must-have, as it offers a wonderful commentary with the late-great Rosemary Clooney.~ClassixFan rated 10/10 on 3 November 2003"

However the way they are done in 'Dream Scenario' was perfect. This film was a blast.Talk about getting everything out of a concept. The movie starts and you think, okay this is a lot of fun, but where are they going to go from here? Have no fear, they have plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the wild ride continues throughout.The film is hilarious. It contained some of the biggest theatre laughs I've heard in a long time. But it's more than that too. It actually gets quite touching and sad and has some real thought-provoking stuff going on. This was an excellent film. 8/10.~jtindahouse rated 8/10 on 1 October 2023"," Really good, up to the point where it isn't.: The first eighty percent of this film was excellent - it felt like the best Stephen King story that King didn't write. The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it.~Lomax343 rated 7/10 on 11 November 2023"," Great look at fame: Dream Scenario is a really funny look at unexpected fame and how it's impossible to control how others interpret it. A be careful what you wish for story that's a lot stronger when primarily focusing on how fame changes a person than when it delves into cancel culture.Uncomfortable with how his own image has been interpreted, Nicolas Cage is the ideal person for this. He plays the pitiful nature of Paul beautifully and brings none of the Cage rage he's synonymous with, in a nice change of pace. The film also feels aware of Cage's persona, understanding everything is funnier and weirder because it's Nic Cage specifically.Kristoffer Borgli's direction really nails the dream sequences in particular. They're very surreal (obviously), brief and when they start to turn into nightmares they really don't hold back on the violence. It also has the second most hilariously awkward sex scene of recent memory, with Beau Is Afraid being number one which is so fitting since Ari Aster is a producer on this.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 14 November 2023"," Bizarre Film: So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10.~vengeance20 rated 6/10 on 11 November 2023"," Leaves viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential: ""Dream Scenario"" falls short of expectations, failing to deliver the cathartic experience viewers seek. Despite an intriguing premise, the film's weak screenplay undermines its potential, leaving audiences frustrated. The lackluster narrative fails to engage, making the otherwise interesting plot lose its appeal. The film's inability to provide a satisfying resolution only exacerbates the viewer's dissatisfaction. With an unconvincing storyline, the movie struggles to maintain interest, leaving audiences questioning the overall creative direction. The weakness in character development further compounds the film's narrative shortcomings. ""Dream Scenario"" lacks the depth needed to connect emotionally with the audience, resulting in a missed opportunity for impactful storytelling. The film's failure to establish a cohesive and compelling storyline leaves viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential. In essence, the movie's disappointing screenplay overshadows any redeeming qualities it may have had, ultimately leaving audiences dissatisfied and questioning its overall merit.~cemozdogan rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Deeply Depressing Satire on Fame: Horror Comedy? Uhm, yeah, no. Sure, there's a handful of funny moments and some scary stuff but it's far from being a horror comedy. This is a very traditional ""Nicolas Cage"" drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there's a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage's performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It's definitely among the best films I've seen this year.~cgearheart rated 8/10 on 24 November 2023"," Nicholas Cage continues his rebirth: Dream Scenario. The increasingly brilliant Nicholas Cage continues his renaissance following his recent superb performances in Mandy, Pig and The unbearable weight of massive talent. Cage plays a run of the mill university professor who oozes normality. His students take no real notice of him. His former colleagues publish papers in top journals whilst he hasn't even started his book yet. But he's happy enough, if not fulfilled. Then, for no apparent reason, he starts appearing in people's dreams. Not just people who know or have met him. Anyone. And in the dreams they tend to be in difficult positions but he does absolutely nothing. He has no control over this. The first half of the film is hilarious - the whole cinema (the lovely Electric, Birmingham) we're in stitches as we see the dreams played out. And then the second half of the film takes a sinister turn, to reflect a changing nature of the dreams. And whilst the comedy ends at this point, the drama begins. Whilst the first half is the better half it would be wrong to say the second is disappointing. Cage is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. Long may it continue. 8 out of ten.~michael-kerrigan-526-124974 rated 8/10 on 15 November 2023"," Good idea, that isn't well explored: The story:University Teacher feels his life is passive.Starts showing up on people's dreams.People start giving him preferentiable treatment like he's a movie star.His introverted wife just wants him to appear on her dream in a sexy way, and doesn't like the spotlight.Ad agency wants to commercialize his image.He shoots down their ideas, he justs wants to write a book about ants.A girl from the ad agency tells him she has intense sexual dreams about him.He tries to have a fling with her, but gets so nervous he farts, and embarassed he leaves.He feels angry about a former colleague stealing his ideas.Starts showing up on people's dreams killing them.People start antagonizing him in the real world.He doesn't know how to react to that, and becomes combative, which worsens the situation.His wife distances from him due to shame.Some time passes.The teacher has stopped appearing in people's dream in America.Humanity develops the technology to make people enter other people's dreams.Vapid pretty teens are paid to make ads into people's dreams.The teacher eventualy learns to use the new technology and enter his wife's dream to appear in a sexy way.

And in the end, the moral is sort of ""all you need is love"", and ""cancel culture is bad"". Has anyone in the world not heard that boring idea a million times over at this point?Here are some interesting concepts they could've taken it: What made his powers start? What made his powers stop? What would happen if he tryed to feel other emotions before sleeping? What if he tryed lucid dreaming? What if he tryed to stop dreaming? What if he was smart enough as a college professor and avoided conflict and called the cops and sued people, instead of getting physical with them? Why only one girl had sex dreams with him?~o_oraculo rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Slow paced, distressing, and with no payoff: If you click on my profile, you will see that I rarely give low ratings to films, but this one checked all of my boxes, I guess.Have you had a tough last few years with covid and social isolation and politics?How about a movie that's both boring and depressing, with characters you don't like to root for?If a film can't be entertaining, it should at least be edifying, but ultimately Dream Scenario is just too weird to have anything to teach us.I guess it's sort of about cancel culture, but I can't think what it has to say about that. It's mostly about a sort of nobody guy whom you don't hate but has unlikable flaws and don't care what happens to him. And then horrible things happen to him, but not in a roller coaster like a horror movie but sort of a death march.~johnnymonsarrat rated 3/10 on 13 December 2023"," Borgli enters the big leagues with perhaps the most intriguing film of the year: I must say first that Dream Scenario is not at all what I expected it to be. After falling in love with writer/director Kristoffer Borgli's previous film Sick Of Myself, then exploring all of his recent short films on YouTube, I thought I had a grasp on what to expect from Dream Scenario, but I was off and that makes it a bit more challenging to form a solid opinion on. One thing is for certain though: regardless of how much you feel like you are enjoying the film as you are watching it, this is the kind of movie that will have you thinking and talking about it, trying to find all the analogies, for some time afterwards. Though my girlfriend left the theater a total of 4 times due to anxiety, she pulled even more apt metaphor out of it than I did when it was over - it gave us a lot to discuss, far more than the average movie.The overall tone was way different than I was expecting. The trailer had me thinking this would be a quirky adventure into dreams and personalities, but Dream Scenario is FAR more horror-leaning than I'd imagined. Having seen Borgli's previous work in combination with the choice to have Nicolas Cage as the lead, this really threw me off. Once you get into it, it often feels like the work of Ari Aster, which made a lot more sense to me when the ending credits hit and I saw that Ari Aster had produced it. Apparently Aster was originally set to direct this film with Adam Sandler as the lead, but after Sick Of Myself did well, Aster pushed to get Borgli in the director's chair for A24. Overall, the movie has its signature Borgli moments but it definitely feels like a combination of Borgli, Aster, and A24 vibes rather than simply a Borgli piece.There is not nearly as much comedy as I thought there would be, and most of it is very subdued. I felt like I was laughing more than anyone else in the theater, and it was not much, to be honest. Laughs are simply not one of the primary focuses of the film, in my opinion. And on the subject of atypical focuses, there are hardly fleshed-out characters in this movie at all - they are more like archetypes or vessels that allow the themes to be explored. The way Cage's character works is that he is an effective ""every man"" in the sense that he's not really likable, but also not especially unlikable - he could be just about any average person, and that's the point. The real ""main character"" is society and their response to what's happening in a collective manner.While it's not the most riveting or throughly enjoyable film, it is incredibly original and does seem to have a lot to say underneath it's surface of ""simplicity"". I was expecting something in the realm of Charlie Kaufman, but what I got was perhaps something I can't compare to almost anything else. At one point in the film, there is a book that is released, and when it does the character who wrote it exclaims ""It was supposed to be called Dream Scenario"", then the publisher responds, ""Is there something wrong with the new title, I Am Your Nightmare?"". I feel like this is a fitting summary of my entire experience with this film. I'm not sure if that was all set up on purpose, as a ""haha"" at the viewer's expense, but knowing Borgli and his specific style of genius-level trolling, I'd say he knew exactly what he was doing.~Stay_away_from_the_Metropol rated 7/10 on 23 November 2023"

Nevertheless, the Christmas magic is palpable, complete with 'Parents Just Don't Understand' vibes, vibrant colors, and whimsical decor.While the humor occasionally falls short in delivery, with jokes teetering on the edge of laughter, the movie brings forth chuckles and witty lines like ""You elf'in kidding me."" Admittedly, it felt like a subtle ad campaign for Jeep, El Segundo's Candy Cane Lane, and USC-Fight on, I suppose.

It is a step up from his previous Amazon Original, Coming 2 America.

So Eddie Murphy delivers his second Amazon Movie and his first Christmas themed movie and as a huge Fan of his I can say I'm absolutely disappointed.The movie starts of promising and seems to build up to original ideas, but only goes downhill as soon as the story starts to evolve. Sadly it's a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it's hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes. There's not one scene that really made me laugh and the movie is so exhausting at times that i really struggled not to turn it off. I don't know what Eddie was thinking but this feels soulless and you can see it on the actors faces and their energy.

The movie is directed by Reginald Hudlin (""Boomerang"", ""House Party"", ""The Black Godfather""). Murphy and Ross play a married couple, the Carvers, whose house in the Los Angeles suburbs is a perennial candidate for their block's Christmas decorations contest. Chris (Murphy) in particular is a Christmas obsessionist, so much so that his children (and, coincidentally, his wife) all have Christmas-themed names and the family's garage is overflowing with Christmas memorabilia throughout the year. As the story begins, Chris is a sales manager freshly laid off just in time for the holiday (an exchange with a supervisor references Chris' alleged oldness by the fact that he uses a rolodex). Wife Carol is looking at a promotion at a distribution services factory. In the midst of the very mixed career news for mom and dad, Chris buys a gaudy, flamboyant lawn-decoration Christmas tree a from a pop-up store run by a chatty manager (an alternately perky and menacing Jillian Bell). Unbeknownst to Chris, Pepper the manager is actually a rogue elf (fired by Santa for being a martinet about the naughty list) who likes to sell enchanted Christmas decorations to unsuspecting desperate people, which enacts a curse: if the hapless victim cannot collect enough golden rings by a deadline, they will turn into a living glass miniature, forever! Like, bummer!Needless to say, plenty of Christmas shenanigans ensue, all based around The Twelve Days of Christmas song. So, can Chris, Carol, Joy, Nick and Holly round up all the rings, dodge the Christmas dangers, and live to save the holiday (and maybe win the neighborhood decorations contest)?You'll have to watch to find out! Some other supporting players include some sketch comedy alumni (Chris Redd, Robin Thede, David Alan Grier, Nick Offerman) who get to offer an assortment of quips and jabs during the proceedings.""Candy Cane Lane"" is a perfectly acceptable family-friendly Christmastime film. Murphy and Ross do well as the leads, with a nice rapport between them. Murphy seems to generally rein in his improv instincts and generally sticks to the script by Kelly Younger. In fact, any number of instances where a character is about to curse there's an interjection involving a holiday song, which seems to be a deliberate in-joke about the characters Murphy was known for playing early in his career. Ross, by now a longtime television comedic actress, does well in what could have been a thankless and colorless role. There's plenty of good soundtrack music choices, and the special effects are excellent. Several sequences will find younger kids really entertained.Check it out, and have fun!~hypestyle rated 8/10 on 3 December 2023"," Wanted to give it a higher rating...: I have been a long time fan of Eddie Murphy and although I haven't always found him as funny as I hoped, his roles have always been charming enough to satiate my expectations.I started this movie with bridled expectations. The camera work and lighting in this movie is really nice, the effects were also quite well done, and I enjoyed some of the music, though I did notice that some of the music sounded like generic loops from Garage Band were used.Where this movie fell apart was the story and delivery. The story felt forced, where it needed more fleshing out and new characters seemed to drop from the sky and clash with the story instead of interweaving.The characters were also annoying, with some just being outright vulgar and some screaming their lines as if screaming somehow validated their dialogue.Eddie Murphy and his family seemed disconnected from each other, as if there had been a miscast of the actors. Their dialogue was shallow and the most disappointing thing was that it wasn't delivered with convincing tone and body language.The movie had all the trappings of all of the common commercialized Christmas movies that are being released now days, case in point there were two prominent cans of brand-name paint on display in one of the first scenes of the movie.This will not be a movie that I add to my yearly watch list by no means.~compmend-60164 rated 3/10 on 1 December 2023"," Horribly Acted, Horribly Written: This was a complete waste of time. I can't believe Eddie Murphy took this gig. Didn't he read the script first? Bad jokes and over-acting by a third rate supporting cast, and Murphy honestly seemed to not care. Either that, or there was only so much he could do with his pathetic lines. He seemed to be phoning it in. I really like him, and hope he gets something better to work with.Special effects were awkward. Lines ended nowhere with a thud. Also, a very objectionable anti-Christian joke.I was wondering whether this movie was written by a relative or something.

It wasn't very good and it was boring. I really didn't care what the problem was or what Eddie Murphy was trying to accomplish. The live coverage of Candy Cane lane made no sense and the reporters were terrible actors. The news coverage came out of no where. The movie was a mix of a bunch of bad parts and recycled stories.

But back on the mainland the whole of chicken-kind faces a new threat, and Ginger and her team decide to break in."," Man, I wanted to LOVE this one: Aardman Animations, personally, is a hit or miss for me as in the past, they have created some great works like Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and so forth. But at the same time, they have made some pretty mediocre or pretty bad works too. ""Chicken Run"" is one of my favorite stop-motion movies as I really like the characters, the animation, and the narrative. With this sequel coming out after many years, it was entertaining but it was a bit underwhelming.Throughout, the stop-motion animation, character models, and colors are amazing as Aardman continues to provide great clay animation. Aardman always provides some great animation and the models, colors, sound designs, and the movements are all excellent. We get to see the same characters from the previous movie and it was fun to see them communicate, move around and observe their actions throughout. The voice performances from the cast members were solid as they provided some good voice works, although a few voice performances weren't great. The soundtrack is pretty good and there are some decent humor moments that I chuckled at.With the narrative continuing from the previous movie, the narrative explores some new concepts and territories within the setting and characters and there are some aspects that were interesting but some not so much. Certain new concepts that were explored I felt weren't strong enough and at times, it really feels like a rehash of the first movie. On the characters, there are new characters that are introduced but unfortunately, none of the new characters weren't really interesting since they felt a bit dull and kind of annoying at times. Because this is a new cast, I personally felt while the original characters are still fun, the chemistry and energy of what made them fun from the first movie felt a bit lacking. The soundtrack is okay and there are some solid dialogue moments while being a bit clunky.Despite my gripes, I still was interested to see where the movie goes and for what it is, it's a decent sequel. Overall, it is entertaining and it's nice to see the characters again, but I wish it could have been better.~chenp-54708 rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Not worth the wait.: There are some prequels or sequels that no one asked for, but end up being happy that they happened anyway.This sadly isn't one one of them.I was already upset by the fact that many of the core voice actors were being replaced. Mel Gibson I could understand for obvious reasons, but the excuse for Julie Sawalha's exclusion was not acceptable. I do believe the real reason was because Sawalha is no longer famous, while Thandi (or Thandiwe) Newton, her replacement, is a big name in the industry. This is a growing trend in modern animation where famous actors are favoured to voice cartoon characters rather than actual voice actors.At one point Ginger fearfully says ""that voice!"" before the reveal of the return of Mrs Tweedy. It would have been extremely awkward if Miranda Richardson was no longer voicing the villain.The story itself is a little too similar to the first Chicken Run and the animation looks too shiny and CGIed, despite most of it being clay-animation. The stakes were not really as high, and the characters were not as fleshed out as they were in the first film.My favourite character is still Fowler, as he was still hilarious. And unlike the new voices for the other main characters, David Bradley does a great job here.The humour in the first film was intelligent and witty. But despite most of the film still being proudly British (even including a chicken character with a Scouse accent), the magic and the passion found in the first film has dampened down quite a lot here.Kids will no doubt enjoy it. But after 23 years, I wasn't all that impressed.~Avwillfan89 rated 6/10 on 18 December 2023"," A decent sequel: For me, this sequel was a decent continuation of the original. It was based on the same concept as the original with some minor additions.The story was simple and light hearted just like the original, the screenplay was decent, the direction was decent, the animation was unique like the original and the voice actors did a good job. The thrill elements were embedded nicely in the story which makes this normal story little bit enjoyable.But to be honest, I think this sequel was unnecessary as it was underwhelming if we compare it to the original. Overall, this movie was a decent entertainer.~akshatmahajan rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Same Mistakes as Early Man: Looks like the creators didn't learn anything from the failure of Early Man (2018). A successful family animation needs to engage folks of any and all ages - the first Chicken Run did to a good extent. This one didn't. Ditto Early Man.Audiences want to see relatable settings, characters with soul, plots that are realistically challenging (not pointlessly ridiculous). So we end up with a colourful bland bright happy island commune ... overdone, unrelatable and boring. Then we get a silly super high tech robots and gadgets filled chicken farm/factory - huh? And football matches in prehistoric Early Man? Huh?From the short documentary on 'the making of' its immediately clear the creators and team spent a massive 99% effort on the puppeting, the sets, the lighting, the movements, the look of things - which is fine, except, where's the effort on the story, the characters, the soul of the whole thing??The director even laughed at how fun it was to give Ms Tweedy a glam look - but hello mister - did you ask yourself what the viewers want out of a once iconic scary evil character like her? A glam up look? Really?It does seem all the people involved in this - many very competent in their area of specialty - was more focused on putting out their best on producing their area of specialty than making an animated movie that truly relates to the audience.For instance so much technical deal and effort was made of Tweedy walking down glass steps - if the story and plotting was better it wouldn't have mattered if she was walking down milk carton cutouts with average lighting and a less smooth gait.Do please spend more thought and effort on plotting and characters and audience impact, and less on the visual razzle dazzle.~charles-limcw rated 5/10 on 20 December 2023"," No charm, feels corporate?: Say what you want about the man but Mel Gibson is sorely missed, that was one of many mistakes this movie made.

Yet another in a long list of agenda filled Netflix blunders. When will they learn?

Although the story picks up where the original left off, this is an entirely new adventure and you don't really have to see the first film to follow the story, although it is highly recommended. The opening to 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget' recaps the events of the first film in a nutshell.The chickens are living happily on an island away from humans, and Ginger and Rocky starts a family. Their daughter is Molly. No sooner has she become a teenager than she becomes curious about the world and what lies on the other side of the lake. When trucks arrive and start clearing the forest, the chickens devise a plan to shelter themselves from human vision, but Molly wants to explore...and so she does.She befriends a chicken named Frizzle, and together the head to Fun-Land Farms where they believe chickens to live happy lives, according to an advert they saw. Off course the farms are not what it seems, and they soon get into trouble.It's up to Ginger, Rocky and some of their friends to save them. Last time they broke out of a chicken farm; this time they're breaking in. A familiar antagonist from the first film returns, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.I enjoyed the stop-motion animation, the characters, their adventures, and the humour. This is a delightful film young and old can enjoy. The film also illustrates how the younger generation are not always appreciative of what their parents went through to ensure their survival, and I don't think youngsters watching this will fully understand. These are lessons a mature audience will relate to.As much as I enjoyed 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget', I enjoyed 'Chicken Run' more, because it was simpler and funnier.~paulclaassen rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," Human chickens or chicken humans?: I was keen to see this movie, as I loved the original Chicken Run.It's a long time since the first movie, so naturally the voice actors have changed. This was OK, except I thought Thandiwe Newton sounded a bit too "" posh"" to play Ginger. I got used to it (love Thandiwe!), but I did miss Julia Sawalha and I think the original had a better cast.The main problem for me was the way the chickens are now portrayed. In the first movie, they were hens living at a poultry farm, having to lay a certain number of eggs each day, or risk getting topped by the farmer's wife. So they were basically chickens living like chickens. What made it amusing, of course, was the hens' human qualities, and the fact that whole thing ran like the satirisation of a prisoner-of-war escape movie.However in the sequel, all pretence at ""chicken life"" has gone; the chickens live exactly like humans, and are in effect just humans who look like chickens. Egg laying is a rare event; it's all farming and building and lounging in deck chairs sipping drinks. The spivvy rats with their dodgy goods are now lovable. And to make matters worse, Rocky and Ginger have a ghastly brat of a kid called Molly.As the plot of this movie is also pretty weak, I found it hard to get involved. God forgive me, I was dying for Molly to get turned into a chicken nugget.Didn't work for me. I find it hard to care about chickens who have turned into humans.~KittyG26 rated 2/10 on 16 December 2023"," Nowhere near as good as the original but still really good: Diminishing returns are in full effect with Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, a harmless film that's filled with good messages about parenting even if they've all been done before. It's only sporadically funny but it gets away with it thanks to its stop motion claymation which is increasingly rare to see and just a gift to have.Recasting Mel Gibson makes sense and replacing Julia Sawalha really doesn't. That being said Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi do a good job of making the swap as seamless as possible. Bella Ramsey's Molly is a welcome addition with the ideal amount of childlike wonder and yearning for more in life.Sam Fell's direction gets so much mileage out of the claymation. This form of animation requires so much care and patience which makes everything better. The only slight issue is how clean everything is. Generally it's just really vibrant and clearly very polished which feels like it comes at the cost of losing the original's style.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," Insincere and forced: The stop motion is always on point. Impressive, when you think about how much time goes into it.If you work really hard, you can probably scrape together some respect for the production, but that might be the only feeling you can evoke. The voice acting isn't great, and not just because the original actors are missing. There's a strange disconnect between the animation and the acting, it feels insincere and forced.The story is nothing new, and it should have been. It should have broke new ground just as the original did. It really feels like they put no effort into creating an original plot and just clung to the coat tales of the first film. Seems like a bad choice.I want to write something positive about it but I don't really know what that could be. I guess Bella Ramsey was good casting. I'm only giving it 5 stars because I appreciate the time it takes to make stop motion.~neomastanford rated 5/10 on 15 December 2023"," Yikes this is bad: I don't know what to say, I've been looking forward to this for ages and after watching it, Wow!The voice acting is awful, they've changed some of the original actors and they're not even close, it's jarring, whoever voices Ginger is awful, talk about phoning in a performance and Rocky sounds like a completely different character.The animation looks like made for TV stuff, really cheap and devoid of the originals charm, the story is okay and will no doubt keep kids occupied but for adults, there's nothing here where as the first one had loads of adult humour.This is far from the worst thing I've seen but Wow is it a massive step down from the original, really disappointing. Still good to see Mrs Tweedy return though so that's at least one plus.~phantasmda rated 3/10 on 15 December 2023"

However, that never happens. In fact, in the end, nothing happens. Things remain where they are, and the audiance, who knows that no one is who they appear to be, is left perplexed.However, the performances were strong from the two leads, Portman and Moore. But, other than that, the movie is a let down.~PennyReviews rated 5/10 on 27 November 2023"," A lot of problems. Not what I was hoping for.: Maybe I had too many high expectations for this film. But the script is all over the place and many of its plot points raised more questions than answers.First of all, why would it only be the lead actress Elizabeth (Natalie Portman) who is spending time with the family her film is focused on? Surely that's for the director and the screenwriter to unpack? I understand she wanted to get into her character and meet the woman she would be playing. But then she does something completely innappropriate, and there are no consequences for it.With Gracie, in the end, there really isn't much more to unpack than what we already know from the beginning. She is a sexual predator and a child rapist who ended up marrying her victim and had kids with him. That's it.Joe, on the other hand, is probably the most interesting part of the film. His character goes through a lot and is the most conflicted out of all of them. He slowly realises that the decision to stay with his abuser and raise a family was done out of naivety, youth and possibly grooming. Now that he, as well as all of his children, have grown up, he starts to mature and question his life.So perhaps the film should have been only from his point of view and not Elizabeth's, as she was very undeveloped and vapid.In the end, not that all impressed.~Avwillfan89 rated 6/10 on 2 December 2023"," Uneventful, completely lacking in true drama, with a disjointed tedious script: I really respect director Todd Haynes for the many great movies he has made untill now, but this is not one of them...The bad: however intrigueing this story might sound, the execution of it was bland and tedious. Director Todd Haynes is known for making exquisite subtle SLOWburning dramas in which characters are central, but however good the acting, however promising the set up of this story, the end result is completely void of real drama.We get to see some ladies chatting at diner, ladies arranging some flowers, ladies at a party etc etc. This goes ON and ON from the very start till the last minute. Endless scenes wherein literally NOTHING happens whatsoever.Bring your search light and a microscope in order to detect any trace of drama or thrill. What a complete and utter misfire of a drama.At best, only to be recommended for old ladies who dont mind watching an absolute snorefest on a slow sunday afternoon...~imseeg rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Unsettling Character Study (Literally): ""May December"" finds Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore in an unsettling character study (literally) about an actress researching a role in a movie where she will play a 36 year old woman who had an affair with a 12 year old boy and then ended up marrying him.This is being billed as a dark comedy, and I've seen more than one person talking about how funny it is. It's not funny in the conventional sense, but I suppose there is a certain (extremely dark) joke played on the world of actors and how they go about preparing for roles. Portman's actress character is ostensibly doing so much research because she wants to truly understand Moore's sex offender and show a sympathetic side. But at the end of the movie, Portman -- and us, the film's audience -- are no closer to really understanding Moore than we were at the beginning. So what was Portman doing, really, with all of that ""research?"" Is it really important to her understanding of this woman and her upcoming performance that she knows how Moore applies her makeup? I imagine this movie might seem funnier to people in the movie industry than to the casual movie goer.What makes ""May December"" so unsettling is that at the center of all this is the boy, now a grown man, but who in many ways is still stuck at twelve. Are movies about subjects like this really trying to get at ""truth"" as they claim, or are they exploiting other people's pain? And if the latter, what role do we as an audience play in being complicit in that exploitation? This seems to me to the be crux of what director Todd Haynes is exploring in this film, and it doesn't come to a conclusion about it. It asks the question and leaves us to ponder it.The trio of Moore, Portman, and Charles Melton as Moore's husband are giving great performances in this. Moore's is especially a fascinating creation. What if there isn't a lot of depth to this woman that Portman is trying so hard to unravel? What if she's actually just a crappy person? Where does that leave Portman and her desire to tell the other side of the story. Moore walks a knife edge with her character, and we're never completely sure whether she's the villain or the victim. Portman gets an Oscar moment of her own, a monologue delivered directly to the screen. Is she an actress truly committed to her craft, or is she just a narcissist using other people's pain and confusion for her own gain? Are all actors narcissists to a certain extent? And Melton has a few moments of heartbreaking vulnerability where the lost little boy peeks out from the facade of the man.A juicy film that gave my wife and I a lot to chew on after we watched it.Grade: A.~evanston_dad rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Disappointing: In moviemaking, there's subtlety, and then there's subtlety carried too far. In the case of director Todd Haynes's latest, the filmmaker unfortunately indulges himself far too much in the latter. This story of an actress (Natalie Portman) who visits a middle-aged sex offender (Julianne Moore) to prepare for a role she's about to play in a movie about her subject's life never seems to find a footing to stick with and explore. The narrative examines many different aspects of the back story behind the lives of the characters to be portrayed in this pending production without ever really resolving any of them by the time the credits roll. This includes not only the protagonist's reasons for pursuing her once-underage husband (Charles Melton) - actions that got her jailed and made her fodder for countless tawdry tabloid cover stories - but also the nature of the actress's real motivations in conducting such an excessively intense in-depth study of her character. In the process, virtually everyone comes across as somewhat unsavory, and, considering that the truth is never clearly revealed about any of them, it begs the question, why should we care about any of this? The film depicts all of this so subtly that it goes beyond nuance, veering into the realm of enigmatic, thereby further reinforcing the notion of why any of us should care. Ironically, these underplayed elements are in stark contrast to some rather obvious (and terribly trite) symbolism, particularly in images related to themes of transition and transformation. The picture's inconsistent changes in tone don't help, either, vacillating between allegedly serious drama and a seemingly underdeveloped desire to break out as an exercise in full-fledged camp (which, by the way, probably would have made this a much better offering). The script's meandering flow and glacial pacing also don't help, leaving viewers scratching their heads more often than not as to where this story is headed. In the end, all of the foregoing is ultimately quite unfortunate, because there's definite potential in this project, but it's never adequately defined and fleshed out. Leads Moore and (especially) Portman turn in admirable efforts to make this material fly, but they simply don't have enough to work with to make that happen. While there appear to be allusions to themes like the difficulty involved in dealing with long-buried feelings and the fact that we may never be able to adequately grasp the truth behind them (either as outsiders looking in or as active participants in the midst of such dealings), the cryptic handling of those ideas undermines whatever meaningful messages or cinematic value they might have, making all of this seem like just such a big waste of time. Director Haynes has an impressive filmography behind him with such releases as ""Poison"" (1991), ""Far From Heaven"" (2002) and ""Dark Waters"" (2019), but, regrettably, ""May December"" certainly can't be counted as part of that list.~brentsbulletinboard rated 5/10 on 24 November 2023"," The Aftermath of a Crime(s): This movie is based on subtext and doesn't have an overt narrative that progresses like most films.This movie is about the about one of the worst crimes that exists - CSA (look it up). If you understand it's generational and also very difficult to comprehend this movie will hit you HARD.That being said, this is a very well done movie about adults who are really just children. They never healed from their traumas and what ensues is a vision of how life is when you ignore that stuff.I personally have dealt this this crap, and ignoring it is the easy way out...but leads to a unlived life. You have to put the bright lights on it which is what Natalie Portman's character does.The movie is for people that love film as art - not narrative. It is very well done. All the acting is based on nuanced subtext. The score and the cinematography are also very well done (I love slow zooms...sue me).Overall it's a great film if you can just absorb the artform of a well paced uncovering of the aftermath of a crime and what happens when you steal innocence. It's a truly remarkable movie that will impact people that understand this dynamic in life. 8/10.~zack_gideon rated 8/10 on 2 December 2023"," buried emotions bubble up: Greetings again from the darkness. Contentedly, most us live our lives in a manner that would never be worthy of tabloid headlines. Not so for Gracie in this psychologically complex new film from expert director Todd Haynes (FAR FROM HEAVEN, 2002) and writers Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik. Early on, Haynes shows us those tabloids featuring Gracie's scandal following her seduction of 7th grader Joe in the stock room of the local pet store. She was 36 years old, and he was 13. Soon after, Gracie went to prison, where she bore their first child.The story picks up 24 years later as Gracie and Joe are married, and their second and third children, twins Mary (Elizabeth Yu) and Charlie (Gabriel Chung), are graduating high school and preparing to ship off to college. In other words, they are all living a fairly normal life. However, as a harsh reminder that their lives are not actually normal, Elizabeth (Oscar winner Natalie Portman) arrives at their Savannah home to research her role as Gracie in an upcoming indie film about the scandal.Oscar winner Julianne Moore plays Gracie, in her fourth collaboration with director Haynes. Charles Melton (THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR, 2019) plays Joe, who is now the same age as Elizabeth, as well as the kids from Gracie's first marriage. Elizabeth is polite and apologetic as she initially treads carefully in asking probing questions of the family and their friends. Her approach generates some awkward moments, and although Gracie seems to hold firmly to her did-nothing-wrong stance, it's Joe who begins to question things ... mimicking the slow development of the Monarch butterflies he breeds.Perhaps the film's best sequence occurs when actress Elizabeth shows up for a Q&A with Mary and Charlie's class. When the question gets a bit risquÃ©, Elizabeth's answer borders on inappropriate, and is an honest depiction of the fine line between acting and reality. Back at the house, Elizabeth's questions raise previously unspoken doubts, as well as the ongoing impact of the scandal ... not the least of which are periodic postal deliveries of excrement denoting some of the public's view of a female predator.The similarities to the true-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau are inescapable, though a twist here is that Gracie and Joe's recollection of how things started are not necessarily in sync. Savannah is always a character unto itself, and the accompanying music is eerily spot on ... including the repurposing of Michel Legrand's score from THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). The three lead actors (Ms. Portman, Ms. Moore, Mr. Melton) are terrific, and director Haynes has delivered yet another complex movie that gives the appearance of simplicity due to how beautifully it's done.Opens in select theaters on November 17, 2023 and streams on Netflix beginning December 1, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 16 November 2023"," The storyline wanders without apparent direction: It's a drama set in the spring of 2015 in Savannah, Georgia. It follows the visit of actor Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman) to a couple who were the subject of a major scandal in 1992. At that time, Gracie Atherton (Julianne Moore), a married woman with children who worked in a pet shop, had an affair with a 13-year-old boy, Joe Yoo (Charles Melton), and bore his child. She served prison time and later married Joe; they now have three children. The two twins, Mary (Elizabeth Yu) and Charlie (Gabriel Chung) are about to graduate from high school.Elizabeth is to play the role of Gracie in a TV movie. We also meet Gracie's first husband, Tom (D. W. Moffett), and son, Georgie (Cory Michael Smith), from her first marriage. The movie follows Elizabeth's investigation into Gracie's life, which results in picking up some ambiguous messages. She also begins to identify with Gracie in some strange ways.""May December"" was a significant disappointment. Julianne Moore gives a strong performance, but the storyline wanders without apparent direction. The Portman character veers in mystifying directions and arrives at an ending with little logic. The Moffett, Smith, and Melton characters remain too undefined despite their centrality to the story. This lack means an underdeveloped script.~steiner-sam rated 5/10 on 18 November 2023"," Meet the Atherton-Yoo Family!!!: On this website, the film ""May December"" is listed as a comedy-drama. If there is a comic element to the film, it has to be of the darkest nature imaginable. To put it another way: This tawdry film is not like the Neil Simon comedy ""The Odd Couple""!!!It is graduation day for the family of the Atherton-Yoos, as two of the children are preparing for commencement and heading off to college! But this is not your regular nuclear family ... not by a long shot!The conceit of the film is that Miss Elizabeth Berry is an actress who will be playing the role of Gracie Atherton-Yoo in an upcoming made-for-television movie. The audience follows along with Elizabeth in getting to know the Atherton-Yoos! But in one of the most bizarre scenes in the film, Elizabeth seduces Joe, the husband of Gracie. When the poor schlub says that he feels they have a ""connection,"" Elizabeth brushes him off with the remark that this is what grown-ups do!In another outrageous moment, Gracie refuses to have a ""serious"" conversation with her husband about their ""relationship."" Again, Joe gets the brush off when he is told at age 13, HE had seduced the much older adult Gracie, and HE was ""the boss."" It is no wonder that after smoking a joint with his son, Joe begins blubbering like a baby and is comforted by the high school graduate!It is difficult to conceive what the filmmakers were thinking in adapting to the screen the true story of Mary Kay Letourneau. The actress Elizabeth Berry was ostensibly aiming for an accurate characterization of the real Gracie Atherton-Yoo. And yet the filmmakers completely missied the mark on the true story of Letourneau, who seduced her seventh-grade student, as opposed to hooking up in a pet store. And their coupling occurred in a car, not in a storage room. The offspring were born in prison, and the family did not live in luxury home in Savannah!The film merits 3 stars only for the fine performances of Natalie Portman as Elizabeth and Julianne Moore as Gracie in a film that is utterly depressing and unpleasant.~lavatch rated 3/10 on 5 December 2023"," Peculiar character drama with an odd tone: In peculiar character drama ""May December"" married couple Julianne Moore & Charles Melton are notorious in their Georgia hometown, as 23 yrs earlier she (at 36) first seduced him (at 13) - subsequently having their first child behind bars. 23yrs on, with two more kids (twins) about to graduate, actress Natalie Portman comes to stay with them as she prepares to play Moore in a movie - which stirs emotions, heightens traits, and draws memories / accusations. The experienced Todd Haynes directs Samy Burch's debut screenplay with an odd, slightly stylized tone (including with the bizarre score) before ending on ambiguity (sigh).
