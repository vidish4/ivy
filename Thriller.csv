However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.~M_Exchange rated 6/10 on 30 November 2023"," Derivative, but with a twist: Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.~euroGary rated 8/10 on 9 October 2023"," Oliver Quick & The Dead: It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 6/10 on 23 December 2023"," Twisted yet enchanting: Emerald Fennell leaps over any potential sophomore slumps with Saltburn, an immensely twisted tale of obsession and excess that's black comedy eventually goes into much darker territory. It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen). Equally strong is Fennell's screenplay which is hilarious, almost every scene has at least one memorable joke or biting line of dialogue.~masonsaul rated 9/10 on 4 October 2023"," Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value: Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.~brentsbulletinboard rated 3/10 on 9 December 2023"," An artful disappointment: Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.~steveinadelaide rated 5/10 on 24 November 2023"," Saltburn delivers on every level, a captivating film.: Oliver Quick becomes captivated by fellow student at Oxford, Felix. When Felix tells Oliver that his father has died, Felix invites Oliver back to his family home, the grand mansion estate of Saltburn.Imagine coming from a humble background, and being dropped into a world of luxury and abundance, where aristocrats live their lives detached from reality.This had me captivated from start to finish, truly one of the most unique and original films that I've seen for some time.The trailer captivated me, I had high expectations, if I'm honest, it exceeded my expectations. The writing oozed quality, great story, with some magnificent characters.At times it's bizarre, amusing, sexy and intriguing, and at times it's just plain weird. It simmers away for the most part, until the last fifteen minutes or so, when it transformation with a jaw dropping twist.Beautifully filmed, it looks amazing, some of the camera work is exquisite, and that building is simply glorious.The acting is first rate, Rosamund Pike, Richard E Grant and Carey Mulligan are all spot on, Barry Keoghan however, his performance deserves awards, that dance!! Won't forget that in a hurry.Loved it, and didn't want it to end.9/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 9/10 on 17 November 2023"," Not for the squeamish: SaltburnNow this was an interesting film. It's a mind game. It's manipulation. And it's nefarious. Be prepared to squirm Be prepared to gasp. Be prepared to say ""oh dear God"" a few times. The movie follows a very shy and quiet Oxford student on his quest to fit in. After a school year, he is invited to join his new friend at his family's enormous castle where we definitely see him in a fish out of water situation.Then things... happen. Oh boy do they happen. This is all I'm going to say but be prepared for a wild ride, and don't be squeamish. I enjoyed this, but it really deserves its R rating. It's very adult and highlights the depths human beings can go, regardless of material wealth.You know I love to find the human experience presented, possibly with a lesson in mental health awareness. Oh God no. Perhaps there is awareness, but there is no lesson.Rosamund Pike does steal the show. Her one liners are absolutely hilarious.Enjoy the ride.~malmevik77 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"," ð I loved the Cinematography and Gothic Production Design. However, the Film Doesn't Fully Coalesce and Just Sort of Falls Apart (For Me) ð¤·: Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING ð«ð - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience ðð³Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. ð¦ The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. ð¾ The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good.

I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did itð)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. ð©One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. ð©But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtubðð³ and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. ðð¤·3. ð©Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. ð4. ð©The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""ð7. ð¤¦ð» Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.~DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed rated 6/10 on 19 November 2023"," Murky pretentious derivative mess: Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.~Laight rated 2/10 on 24 December 2023"

It starts of quite well but the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. Any apocalypse movie can be interesting in the beginning - when neither the audience nor the characters know what's going on. The difficult part is to make the reasons for the apocalypse make sense and to make the rest of the movie interesting.The premise is interesting, but as soon as the characters start to put the pieces together, the movie ends abruptly. It is one of the weirdest endings I've ever seen. The characters had only solved about 80% of the mystery and it would be interesting to know what would happen next.This whole movie feels like an intro. It feels like a pilot episode of a TV-show. Perhaps they forgot to film the rest of the movie? But I also don't think there was much more to build with after the credits rolled. Still, an enjoyable movie with a great cast - Mahershala Ali was phenomenal.~lovemichaeljordan rated 5/10 on 8 December 2023"," The ending.......AAARRGGHHHHH!!!: I can enjoy slow character-driven movies.....as long as there is a payoff for the slowness.This movie is similar to M. Night original movies, where you as the viewer do not know anymore then the characters in the story. That was nice and refreshing. There were purposeful plot devices that kept you guessing on what was real or not. Again, pretty good so far. Several scenes could have used some editing and easily cut out 40+ minutes of filler, but still okay as long as you have a payoff.Problem is, there is no payoff. So instead of enjoying a slow build, instead you feel as if the movie wasted your time. If the movie had a ending, I could have enjoyed it, but it didn't. The movie credits starts running and you are left with 'WTF?'. Lazy, this is one of those directors have has a good idea, but not sure how to end their project, so they leave it open-ended under the guise of 'audience interpretation'. Dumb.Other things to note, none of the characters are likeable. The young girl is as stupid and mentally challenged as the 'Hereditary' girl, someone who should be watched 24/7 but the parents thinks it is okay to let them go out alone.~Otte1 rated 4/10 on 10 December 2023"," The ending is the point: I read other reviews that didn't like the ending or didn't see the point. Many of us are just fine if we have our screens on and can see our favorite TV show. We can block out the rest of the world no matter what is happening. We watch our own channels on our own devices. The daughter, Rose, in ""Leave the World Behind"" was perfectly happy leaving her family as long as she could watch her TV shows. With a treasure of DVDs at her disposal that included her favorite show ""Friends"", Rose was more than happy to live forever in isolation forgetting about the outside world. When Rose's brother asked her ""Why do you care so much about that show anyway?"", she said, ""They make me happy."" I thought the movie was right on point showing us where our culture was heading.There are people who can't handle the isolation and need the human contact. There are also people who get debilitated by worrying about what is happening in the world. I know a few people who can't function because they need to check the news 24/7. I would say most people are the opposite. I think I'm in that opposite boat. If I'm honest with myself, I care about what happens in the world, but I am more than happy when I find a good Netflix show instead of worrying about it. I would much rather watch my Netflix show than get involved in politics. That's sad, but true.The one thing I didn't quite understand was what the animals were trying to tell the family. I don't think the animals were telling them to go to the house with the bunker, so I was confused about that part. I understood that the hack was throwing off the migration patterns, but they also said the animals were trying to tell them something. We walk around our neighborhood every night, and we regularly see deer in the front yards. One night last week there were four large deer close to the sidewalk. I kept walking and I wasn't worried much they would charge me! But it got unsettling when they were several large deer up close. I can only imagine if there was an entire herd like in the movie.I think the movie was timely. COVID accelerated our isolation with everyone living in their own realities of happiness. I recommend watching this movie and thinking about how our world is rapidly changing. How many of us would be perfectly happy living in our bunkers of our own making with our own devices watching our own shows not needing to pay attention to the outside world? The movie takes it to the extreme with bombs dropping right outside, but I thought the point was powerful. My biggest concern today was whether the Bengals would win Saturday and when the next Reacher episode will drop on Amazon Prime. I tuned out what Trump and Biden were up to today and what was happening in Israel and the rest of the world.~Tron79 rated 8/10 on 19 December 2023"," a boring crap fear of half baked ideas: So long yet nothing happens.So tense yet90% of the tension comes from bizarre camera angles and strange soundtrack choices in a vain effort to distract you from the fact that this movie doing nothing.Boring.

Mom tempted me at times two rethink that, but she eventually grew on me by the end. But after 3/4 of the way through, there was absolutely no advancement of the plot.

Everything is a mess in this movie.You will be able to list 100 left plot points that leads nowhere and was just sort of forgotten about. Its a terrible movie with a great premise.~mindgem rated 3/10 on 29 November 2023"," Oh the calamity!: What a pitiful, ham-fisted attempt at a slow burn...to nowhere. I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans? Sure, but it dilutes its own suspense on the way to saying little about it.~chiltonsjillfreeport rated 3/10 on 10 December 2023"

Ironically, this fervent love and admiration for his father and family creates conflict between the father and son."," Can you really even call it a movie?: Technically, there was no cohesive storyline. Dialogues were all over the place. Conversations between characters were weird. Like every time one would say something and other would go into an unrelated monologue. (Mostly ranbir).It's nothing like the trailer. Story is not about son and father. They didn't show anything about their relationship after the first few scenes.Coming to content, Ranvijay never knew to answer a question straight. His character had no consistency. Even if you make a negative character, his actions need to be consistent. In one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesn't care, and then next instant he would forgive and protect them.A movie needs to have a story, a plot, characters need to make sense inside the movie.Their attempt at jokes were so distasteful. He gives a wedgie to a servant, rants about his underwear, there's two monologues about pubic hair, there's denial about medicine.Even the climax was so underwhelming. They just faught in one song.Worse part was how they used Sikhs in the movie. They tried to use them to do idk what. But they're just around to elevate Ranvijay. And in main climax they're told to stay back. Then killed on screen helplessly. Why would you show something like that.All in all, as a movie it sucks due to lack of story and badly written characters. Then there's the content.~sumi-mishra-789 rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," Such a shame for even animals to name this movie: Ranbir personal show with no story, no logic and absurd action scenes. Anil Kapoor and boby are wasted totally, the film story is from the age where there are no law and enforcement exists you can do whatever you want to either it's your own country or you are in foreign kill as many people as want .... to make a century of corpses is like a piece of cake. Zero emotions and no chemistry between father and son....not even close to a worst family drama and yes it's not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity. Spend 3.5 hrs with your father or if you are father spend quality time with your son and save yourself from this disaster.~ali-79-997033 rated 1/10 on 1 December 2023"," A film for the clinically insane made by a psycho: The movie glorifies violence, physical and sexual abuse, denigration of women and basically banks on shock value to provoke viewers rather than pull in people with a coherent story.The director will claim that he is some sort of indian tarantino, but its not even close. Just a badly made movie with a man whom every woman must be careful of and stay very very very far away. Consider this a warning and avoid this psycho and his movies. Nothing good can come out of them.Its specially troubling when you know that these movies will appeal to already mysoginistic men in India and encourage further crimes against women. Really feel bad for women who now will have to put up with more misogyny because of trash like this.~kothari-raunak rated 1/10 on 3 December 2023", Embarrassingly awful: Went to see it with my 2 boys last night in Manchester.What looked like an awesome film from the trailer turned out to be an awful experience. An embarrassment of 2023.Be Sharmi. Be hayaaii. Be ghairati. The Indians are fast losing their sense of identity as they try so hard to westernise themselves but none of the western world watches any of this kind of trash so why bother losing your authenticity?This film is a sex romp with a mindless and senseless killing spree. It beggared belief and on so many occasions we just wanted to walk out but hung in there hoping against hope it would improve.Ranvir Kapoor an excellent actor was unable to make the film look intelligent at all and a deaf Bobby Deol now looking aged was thrown in for good measure in the last 20 minutes. Anil Kapoor looked lost with the odd decent dialogue but nothing out of the ordinary.It was just killing upon killing with scenes and dialogues of sex that would make Bollywood no go films with your daughter or mother. Any wonder that Bollywood is dying out slowly and actors are out of work. Carry on with this trajectory and Hindi cinema won't exist in another 20 years as it will have lost itself completely.Distasteful. Disrespectful. Disgusting.~jabbarhusayn rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023," Probably the worst movie I've ever seen: You seriously need to question the sanity of the director, producers and even the actors of this film. I'm a bit traumatized by the movie, and Ive seen my fair share of gore. This movie was beyond bad. And the storyline defies logic which makes it even worse. Too many instances where basic questions and clarity in communication would've reduced the screen time from three hours to two hours max. The worst part is the director is planning on a sequel soon.If you value your hard earned money and your mental health, I would advise you to abstain from watching this 3 and a half hour torture of a film.~samitshah2 rated 1/10 on 3 December 2023"," Pathetically cringe, no closure except for boneheads lusting for blood: I have a migraine watching this cringe movie. Literally every aspect of this movie is cringe. And in terms of originality, this is Rajneeti meets Kabir Singh with an overdose of papa, papa. Give it a rest, you can love your father without being abusive to the rest of the world. And the great thing is that there is still no closure for the audiences who've been wound up for 3.5 hours in the hope of at least a detente.The 'visionary' directory Sandeep Reddy Vanga goes to town bringing every debunked cliche to life - the cliched 'alpha' shtick, the slap-happy father who favors the son-in-law over his own son, the subjugated wives and mother, the 1 'alpha' killing 100 of people (not an exaggeration) armed with a couple of axes, creating 'body doubles' as if that's a thing.The funniest part is that the climax fight with Bobby Deol literally has its own narration ongoing in the form of a song in the background - as if singing ""Ye dekho kaisa thappad maara~"" with every slap landed.No closure is offered to any of the sub plots ongoing with the protagonists - the relation with the wife, the kids or even the father. To compensate for this, Sandeep Reddy Vanga overcompensates with gratuitous violence to satisfy the enraged crowd watching this trash, never having been involved in as much as a scuffle, much less an actual fight.The plot is as simple as it gets, and it's clear Sandeep Reddy Vanga didn't have a story to tell, as much as a couple of ideas for scenes he wanted to execute based on his diminutive understanding of Marathi music, fetishization of Sikh Youth and culture and more importantly, his bloodlust to satisfy.Such is the bloodlust, that even the post-credits scene is drenched in more blood than most animes, and that's saying a lot.~bhimsenintellect rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," It was embarrassing to watch the movie after a point.: The movie is ridiculously bad. Keep the misogyny aside (which is absolutely horrid), the movie is still looks like a headless chicken running around. There is absolutely no story. I wanted to leave the theatre on so many occasions, yep, it was that ridiculous.There is such a lack of logic as well! Ranbir Kapoor is in supreme health just a short while after getting a HEART TRANSPLANT and beats the hell out of Bobby Deol. Ranbir is killing 200 men alone while his Sikh brothers are singing in the background. Heights of stupidity.Please do not watch the movie and give it attention that it clearly does not deserve.~tanvidavid rated 1/10 on 5 December 2023"," Worst ever movie!: When we make a female lead movie, everyone labels it as a feminist movie. But even then those movies just portray how a woman challenges society and comes forward in life. Society can't accept even that and rates the movie so low. Then what about this nonsense movie. Is this not a misogynist movie. How many movies like this are shown to insult women and objectify them. Why is no one labelling such movies as misogynist when it actually is. Why are we still showing women as objects in such kind of movies. What is it with movies like Kabir Singh and Animal. This movie is so disgusting, it shows how ranbir is in real life. Look at the movies alia chooses and look at the movies this useless fellow chooses. He either chooses a playboy movie or a movie where he objectifies women. Poor alia to be married to such a misogynist.~abilashsubramani rated 1/10 on 2 December 2023"," Disappointing: ""Animal,"" directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, offers a captivating experience with impressive background music, memorable songs, and technical finesse. However, the film stumbles in terms of story strength and screenplay execution, featuring temporal shifts that lack coherence and fail to enhance the narrative.While the first half engages with its fast pace, the second half unnecessarily prolongs the story, leaving the film feeling overly lengthy and lacking character development, especially with Ranbir Kapoor's character. His abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning, contributing to a disjointed narrative.Despite a touching emotional scene between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor towards the end, it arrives too late, leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure. The credit scenes, though appealing, add to the film's unnecessary length.Ranbir Kapoor's character, portrayed as a hero, raises concerns due to his criminal actions, lack of respect for others, blatant misogyny, and attitude problems. The film's attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic, as it glorifies a man-child who in reality needs therapy.Actress Rashmika Mandanna's performance is very poor, making her unfit for the role. She was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayal.It's disheartening to witness Bollywood failing with films like ""Animal."" The industry has the potential for impactful cinema but seems to fall for subpar narratives. They should strive for better storytelling and more nuanced character portrayals and should avoid the pitfalls of glorifying problematic characters for the sake of entertainment.~asadkhan0810 rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Absolute wild animal: Man.

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.~kevin_robbins rated 5/10 on 20 November 2023"," Long, Boring and not needed.: No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.~skylermoore rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023"," Not On Par: In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.~Tweetienator rated 4/10 on 21 November 2023"," Welcome to the 10th Annual Boring Games... I mean Hunger Games: I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.~nscoby93 rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Incredibly faithful to the book: Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.~vitordrios rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Prequel that tries to show some of the history of the fictional world, but remains somewhat unnecessary.: The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 4/10 on 19 November 2023"," A sure misfire!: I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.~gabriel-80 rated 5/10 on 15 November 2023"," This certainly does not catch fire.: It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Disappointment: I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.~ArchilArjevanidze rated 3/10 on 17 November 2023"," Pleasantly Surprised: I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews.

Die Hard (1988) - IMDb,8.2,Bruce Willis|Alan Rickman|Bonnie Bedelia|Reginald VelJohnson|Paul Gleason|De'voreaux White|William Atherton|Hart Bochner|James Shigeta|Alexander Godunov|Bruno Doyon|Andreas Wisniewski|Clarence Gilyard Jr.|Joseph Plewa|Lorenzo Caccialanza|GÃ©rard Bonn|Dennis Hayden|Al Leong,John McTiernan,Roderick Thorp|Jeb Stuart|Steven E. de Souza,A New York City police officer tries to save his estranged wife and several others taken hostage by terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.," It can't be bettered: This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 25 June 2016"," Now I Have a Machine Gun, Ho-Ho-Ho: In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.~PredragReviews rated 9/10 on 5 May 2016"," Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre: Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 15 May 2010"," THE best action flick ever !: ""Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister."" Well, what else can I say besides that this is ""THE"" (can't stress it more) action movie from the 80's with a young Bruce Willis. Personally, I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie. ""Die Hard"" remains an example for all action movies that followed. At that time you had the Sly and Arnie action movies. But these were more a performance of brutal violence, with big muscles and a sense of invincibility. Bruce showed a clever, shrewd, caustic action hero, who can take a beating, but on the other hand shows that he's not completely invincible.Of course, the action in films nowadays is much bigger, more impressive and mind-blowing, but the strength of this film is the story, the accumulated tension, lightness and the dry humor of Bruce Willis. From the first minute he takes you in his grip, and he won't let loose. You see him slowly evolve from a wrinkle-free clean-shaved top cop into a reasonable damaged hero. This pattern keeps coming back in the next two parts, which are also top movies of the same caliber.You'll notice this is already an old movie because for instance lighting a cigarette in a public place isn't prohibited. But how the action scenes are imaged, is still top-work and should be the aim for many action flicks.I think the sudden confrontation between Gruber and McClane is one of the strongest scenes in this film, along with the well known ""Yippie-kay-yee"" cry. Trademark of Willis. The fact he likes the character of McClane a lot, you see clearly in ""The Last boyscout"". In that movie he plays an impoverished detective with the same coolness and cynical, dry humor as McClane. Too bad that in the last two Die Hard movies, McClane is only a shadow of himself like in the original movie.""Die Hard"" is one of those rarities in movie land, which you can watch without thinking ""Pfft Again this movie"". It remains, for me, an enjoyment to watch.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT~peterp-450-298716 rated 9/10 on 9 September 2015"," ""Welcome to the party, pal!"": (In brief)By any measure, ""Die Hard"" was a pretty muscular movie back in '88. It made cultural icons out of its two stars and the explosions were guaranteed crowd pleasers. The script (note-perfect) ran like clockwork with setup-and-payoff and was stocked with memorable characters throughout; the hero reluctant and vulnerable, his stakes ever ratcheting, while the action would just keep mounting until . . . Well, there wasn't any more opulent high-rise. It doesn't matter what time of year you watch this movie, it functions perfectly in July and December (or even today, so close to Halloween) and always his the spot. It's the ultimate ""You can't go wrong with"" movie.(Less brief)After twenty minutes of story setup, BAM! The guns start blazing and the death toll gets going. At a certain point, this just becomes kind of a theme park ride as John McClane scrambles through the bowels of Nakatomi Plaza and everything's raining down around him.McClane is the key to making all of this work after all. He's the ideal rally-behind character, neither hulking nor shredded and always thrust into a fight; and Bruce Willis is working at peak likability. But he's matched by Alan Rickman, the master scene-stealer, as devilish as they come. It's a rivalry commensurate with such a big movie.And McTiernan's the perfect director for this gig. His direction is self-assured, his camera calm and measured. Sure, we're confined to this building the whole time, but the audience had plenty of moments to take a breath and soak it in. Put it this way: can you imagine someone like J. J. Abrams helming this? Stock up on Dramamine first.I can go on and on, but the bottom line is this: ""Die Hard"" is just *fun*. There's joy in the gunfire, personal injury and wanton property destruction. I always feel great after watching this.~Mr-Fusion rated 10/10 on 30 October 2022"," Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.: Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10~Robert_duder rated 10/10 on 7 February 2007"," Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre: In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line ""Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er"". The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss.~Screen_Blitz rated 9/10 on 3 December 2015"," Ladies and gentleman, Mr.Bruce Willis, Movie Star: DIE HARD (1988) **** Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, Hart Bochner, Robert Davi.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company.  As the "" fly in the ointment"", Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away.  Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.   Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office!  Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. ""Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!"" (Dir: John McTiernan)~george.schmidt rated NA on 6 March 2003"," The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time: Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.~ivo-cobra8 rated 10/10 on 4 February 2018"," Iconic Action: The ultimate combination of action, crime and Christmas, Die Hard is timeless in its appeal. Willis is the perfect casting in his most iconic role of McClane, with Rickman the faultless foil, as the equally iconic Gruber.Not only is the action explosive and pulsating, but the wider cast of characters also get some form of arc, fleshing them out. Dialogue is great (even if the German may be a bit off), and the setting never tires despite being restricted within the single building.Big budget, all-out action and perfect one-liners, all in one festive present.~deepfrieddodo rated 10/10 on 5 December 2021"

Enough said.: Almost 90% of characters, including the antoganists, in Salaar praise the Hero for what a great destructor he is. The value of each character in the movie depends on how much of an extreme buildup they give for the Hero character.""He did that"",""He will do that"",""Until he asks, the Sun won't rise"",""He is here, the universe is watching with fear""""He is a dinosaur resurrected in human form""and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on.You are already tired. And, this is also already a sign of worst things to arrive and they do arrive with full force. Every scene the hero Prabhas is shown it comes with some epic music as if a war was just won. Every single thug with a weapon is beaten to pulp by the Hero. No need to mention, with bare hands. No matter even if the warring group holds in possession of modern war tanks and kalashnikov's and standing right opposite the Hero with an intent to kill, the hero kills each one of them with a machete.In one particular scene, the Hero is on the verge of killing an important character, all the 50 odd army men around him falter simultaneously in loading their rifles to shoot him. Yep, not a single one. Everyone drop their bullets or guns slip from their hands. All 50 falter loading the damn rifles at the same time. The Hero is let to finish his killing job at ease. That is how a great fighter the Hero is. Or, how cheaply incapable the villains are.Final thought: DON'T WATCH THIS PATHETIC THING.~XboxWon rated 2/10 on 30 December 2023"," A Dinosaur which barely breaks the ice: Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.~sujanfaster rated 7/10 on 23 December 2023"," * Film Injected with Over Mass Elevation but not having enough impact for the goosebumps: ***Salaar Movie Review ***Directed by Prashant Neel starring Rebel Star Prabhas in the lead. Also starring Prithviraj SukumaranPrashant Neel's KGF, this was the reason for watching Salaar & an expectation that there will be link of KGF and Salaar but the later is not there.Coming to Salaar, the movie had given mass moments but it's kind feel of over injection of mass elements which creates a disinterest in watching.Prabhas had given the best with his swag and the way he delivers the action but a viewer who watched Yash in KGF, the same goosebumps is not having when watching Prabhas in Salaar. The background music had been used extensively to elevate the mass sequences which clearly gives an indication that its intentionally made.Prithviraj had given a decent performance.The last 30 minutes filled with action was interesting but when deep driving in the second half, many times the screenplay had been accelerated thereby a lot feeling that something is not going as per it is required.The core of the movie is similar to of KGF. It's about the POWER but Salaar had expressed in through the mode of friendship & violence..There will be a lot which needs to be unboxed in Part so Part 1 is an above average flick for me.~skmenon1993 rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," Ugramm on steroids.: Devaratha (Prabhas) and Varadha Raja Mannar (Prithviraj Sukumaran) are best friends in Khansaar. Circumstances lead to Deva and his mother leaving Khansaar and living in exile, moving from city to city. Aadhya (Shruti Haasan) comes to India without informing her father and her life is at stake. Deva is assigned to safeguard her but he has to do it without his mother's knowledge as she disspproves his violent side. Protecting Aadhya pitches Deva right against Varadha and things aren't the same among the two friends turned foes. What happened to them in the world of Khansaar is something one is expected to watch in part 2, instead this part is about showing glimpses of where Deva had been and not what he did. Adding to that there are a bunch of baddies in Khansaar and the place's bloodied history connected to Deva.Prashant Neel has reworked his script of Ugramm in a much grand way, going all out in building a new world called Khansaar, just like he did with Narachi in KGF. That justifies him resorting to KGF narrative style for Salaar as well with his trademark quick cut aways and non-linear narrative with constant hero elevations. There are actually four of those in this film. The entire first half is dedicated to introducing and re-introducing Prabhas's Deva. Bigger canvas meant the mother - son segment taking a bigger hit and Neel has not been able to effectively crack it this time around. This is made up for by the terrific pre-interval action block and Prabhas's towering screen presence is put to good use even though his performance remained one toned. It is the entry scene of Prithviraj Sukumaran which had an impact.The second half is exclusive to establishing the world of Khansaar and it's several provinces as right from the King to the several lords are introduced along with the constitution of their own. This is where Salaar takes the bigger deviation from it's source material. The pace does get slow but the ones acquainted with KGF films, know exactly what to expect. The high moments are few but when they arrive, they explode. Asusual the final 15mins leads to an action segment giving both male leads equal opportunity to shine. Neel has kept majority of the story to be reserved for the sequel and this slightly disappoints. The final reveal is good enough to keep the intrigue for the sequel but barring those couple of scenes, the film's narrative is rather flat.Overall, it is not an exceptional intro though it succeeds in generating interest for the sequel. I am going with lenient rating due to the efforts put in to create this world and giving deserving Kannada actors a bigger film to showcase their acting skills.~chand-suhas rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Salaar: A Prolonged Odyssey with Moments of Attraction: Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.~NARCISSISTIC_CINEPHILE rated 6/10 on 22 December 2023"," Loong & booring: Prabhas can't act ofc. If you're not from andra, he is a below average actor. KGF 1 & 2 had us routing for Rocky bhai till the end with great storyline & soundtracks but Salaar lacks all this. Prabhas face looks so bland and emotionless throughout the movie, keep in mind that he was paid 100 crores!!! He just appears tall and big. Thats all. Prashant Neel kept on saying that this movie is full of drama rather than action and I feel like he was taking a safe route because he knew there's no way Prabhas could reach the audience as a true action hero like Rocky bhai. Tbh I fell asleep after the interval and was looking at my watch to see when this movie would end. Just a waste of time and money. Andra audience ofc will hype this up as much they can but the reality is prashant missed it this time.~MatthewKay007 rated 2/10 on 23 December 2023"," Too much Hype: I went to watch this movie for Prashanth Neel believing that he would do justice but I came out very disappointed. Too much build up , too much hype and too much slow motion scenes. Anything that is more than the necessity made this movie a disaster. At a point i felt sleepy when there was only information being passed for too long and suddenly there would come a build up with a bgm to just keep us awake. Half of the movie was filled with slow motion which felt like it was prolonging the scene. Prithivi Raj and Prabhas acting and screen presence is great but that alone is not enough for a movie to be successful. It is another downfall for Prabhas.~akil-vijay11 rated 1/10 on 23 December 2023"," A good comeback for Prabhas.: I wanted to give 8 stars but there are many in the review section purposefully giving 1 stars even though they haven't watched the film.. all are drowning in ego and forgot at the end of the day it's an Indian cinema....Positives in the movie is cinematography, huge story line and even background music, linke in kgf this time Ravi Basrur's bgm didn't overshadow the dialogues, and I like prithviraj sukumaran's acting more than prabhas but Prabhas is playing that kind of role who talks less one who watched Ugramm will realise thatComing to the negatives- Ugramm's influence is the problem here especially kannada audience feel it as a old food in a new plate, but those who didn't watch Ugramm may like this film and another major drawback what I think is under utilisation of prabhas and less screen space....~sagartiptur rated 10/10 on 23 December 2023"," It is a waste of time: Please don't fall for hype. . We wasted our time. Direction is horrendous, they show part Europe and part some kgf kind city. Nonsense to the core. Why can't they get good story. Who said bloodbath means story, no goosebumps. I believe they have paid for these reviews. The actors just stand stiff and do nothing other than cut body parts, movie does not make sense at all. The movie makes bo sense in many parts. The hero is kept in prison but comes out and beheads a guy in front of everyone. He first begs him to kill him and although there are people with guns all around they do nothing. It makes no sense. This is a very bad movie, please stay away from the hype and paid elements. For Prabhas this would be the end of the career so they are making sure it works. But the movie is bad.~ramanb-b rated 1/10 on 23 December 2023"," A Hollow Spectacle: Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.~magadalwarmayur rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"

I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 10/10 on 5 July 2019"," You name a genre, this movie covers it: I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.~jtindahouse rated 8/10 on 6 October 2019"," Meritocracy: it's metaphorical: In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.~nehpetstephen rated 10/10 on 25 August 2019"," Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it: A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.~bob the moo rated NA on 16 August 2020"," For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half: It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.~mysticfall rated 10/10 on 18 October 2019"," Thoroughly entertaining: PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.~Leofwine_draca rated 10/10 on 1 November 2020"," A true masterpiece.: This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece.

So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!~boblipton rated 10/10 on 9 December 2021", Great: The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 4 February 2020," Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea: This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.~perica-43151 rated 9/10 on 16 January 2020"

Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.~prberg2 rated 5/10 on 30 September 2023"," The Creator uses its budget masterfully, but it's not without its problems: This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.~poseyfan rated 7/10 on 29 September 2023"," What's it all about, Alphie?: The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.~BA_Harrison rated 5/10 on 27 September 2023"," Lots of stuff happend then it ended: I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly.~Jim_Screechy rated 5/10 on 17 November 2023"," Technically Watchable but Emotionally Vacant.: Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly clichÃ© movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems clichÃ©. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.~kgprophet rated 5/10 on 29 September 2023"," Typical and formulaic: Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)~FeastMode rated 4/10 on 28 September 2023", Stunning visuals/Garbage Script: With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.~davemanson rated 4/10 on 11 October 2023," The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element: My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.~kevin_robbins rated 6/10 on 30 September 2023"," State of the art effects, but more holes than Swiss cheese: Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.~Lomax343 rated 6/10 on 28 September 2023"," By the numbers take on man vs robots dystopia: AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.~alex_with_a_P rated 4/10 on 1 October 2023"

The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it.~kevin_robbins rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Not sure what people are watching: I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad. I'll start with the few positives. It's mostly well-made from a technical perspective. I loved the scenes of carnage and chaos. And all of the kills made my jaw drop. It doesn't hold back.Everything outside of the kill scenes is bad. I wish they leaned more into the dark fun slasher vibes. Instead they try to be serious, which magnifies how bad, bland and dumb the rest of the movie is. And while the mystery is intriguing and unpredictable, the reveal isn't even a tiny bit satisfying.This will probably be more enjoyable if you haven't seen many movies. (1 viewing, 12/19/2023)~FeastMode rated 3/10 on 20 December 2023"," I never envisioned this film being so good: We actually got it. It took a long time but we finally got a 'Thanksgiving' movie based on the infamous 'Grindhouse' trailer from 2007. I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 16 November 2023"," Bad: At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good. There is a solid horror movie in there somewhere but that movie is not written, directed and produced by Eli Roth.~Smarmelade rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Super Fun: There were so many opportunities for this movie to go wrong. There is nothing better than a painfully stupid concept well executed to the point that it is actually good. Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it.~tkdlifemagazine rated 7/10 on 19 November 2023"," The Year's Biggest Turkey: Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting. It isn't.I suppose I've only myself to blame for watching it. Clearly, I should've remembered Bob Newhart's words: ""See, Walt, that's an *American* holiday.""Thanks to a membership card, I saw this for free - and I still feel ripped off.~Lomax343 rated 2/10 on 18 November 2023"," I'm at a loss: I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes. I love cheesy horror movies, but this doesn't even count as one. I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.~Gith13 rated 2/10 on 2 December 2023"," There's something wrong about this one: Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.~kuner-59029 rated 5/10 on 23 November 2023", It's like Halloween is still going on.: Eli Roth is a genius! This is some of Roth's best work. The social commentary on Black Friday was well played and Thanksgiving has some of the best gory kills I ever seen. I was bursting out of my seat watching some people get killed and other deaths I felt bad for even though they were not great people. It's just that no one deserved to die the way Roth had some of these folks taken out.Plus it was witty. Thanksgiving took some stabs (pun intended) at itself and it was funny.Defiantly a worth wild horror flick. Felt like I been waiting 16 years for it sense that trailer in Grindhouse and it did not disappoint.~subxerogravity rated 8/10 on 19 November 2023," Mind numbingly STUPID: Look, I love slashers. Despite their low numbers they are my favorite subgenre of horror. I don't ask for much, a coherent story and a surprising villain. However - I draw the line at being insulted. I don't even know how this film got the funding - it is just an insult to audiences. The gore, great, and sure there are some laughs. However the story is beyond stupid, and fine I could forget that if the film was fun like ""Freaky"". However, the cast are awful, 30 year olds mascarading as high schoolers? Ok, I'll get over it. A killer who simply can't be the killer cause you just showed them in TWO places at once? I draw the line. It's insulting, and it made me so mad. All it took was a small rewrite to make something timeless. Instead an absolutely horrible film. So disappointing.

I'm not sure it's deserving of cult status, but don't ask me why, I have a feeling that in years to come, this may well develop something of a following.The clue is in the title, Violent Night, and boy this film doesn't hold back, in terms of violence and manner of deaths, this film packs a real punch, you will see all sorts, people dismembered, shot, impaled, it really doesn't hold back.If Santa did actually pop down for a visit, I can imagine him being this disillusioned, this irritated, with a genuinely low opinion of people, this is where the film scores in my opinion, the performance of David Harbour, who is genuinely very good.Enjoyable music throughout, good special effects, plenty of action, Violent Night was a Christmas surprise.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 6 January 2023"," This Santa Dies Hard: Possibly the most tedious film question ever asked is, ""is Die Hard a Christmas movie?"" Violent Night says ""what if Die Hard WAS a Christmas movie?""Its an excellent mix of two genres. First and foremost it's a (very violent) man in a tight spot action movie but hidden beneath is a traditional Christmas story of people becoming believers and a jaded main character getting their feative mojo back.The film success is largely down to David Harbour's fantastic turn as a disillusioned St Nick. His ability to project charisma even when appearing tired and fed up carries the day, or in this case, night. He also cleverly avoids the trap of playing Santa too dark, for all his boozing and necessary killing he is still recognisably Father Christmas. The rest of the cast are all decent as well, with John Leguiziamo making a fun villian. Even the child character manages to not be annoying, although some of her dialogue hints that they had originally wanted a younger actress than Leah Brady.The other big plus Violent Night has is its, well violence. The set pieces go above and beyond, with villians being impaled, burned and dismembered. Highlights include a Home Alone inspired sequence (turns out the invaders in this film are a lot less durable than Harry and Marv) and a Mortal Kombat worthy finish to the final showdown. There's also a decent vain of comedy even if you won't exactly be guffawing in the aisles.There are a couple of things that take you out of proceedings, like the bad guys refusal to just shoot their guns and some very generic family interactions, but overall Violent Night is a very fun couple of hours.8 lumps of coal for 10 naughty mercenaries.~danchilton-71955 rated 8/10 on 30 December 2022"," Die Hard Santa: This movie is a beautiful mixture of Die Hard, Home Alone, Thor... It also contains several cliches from other movies. Not a problem. Yes, it's predictable, but it is kind of different of what we usually recieve on Christmas, and I personally appreciate different movies.First, action, gore and scenarios are great. Also the main cast. I think almost everyone here does a great job. I really enjoyed music used here too. Great choices.Second, the script is predictable but at the same time, it keeps you entertained from beginning till the end.

It isn't always nearly as entertaining as it could be, but it definitely capitalises on its goofy premise in all the right ways at various points.The violence is blunt and rudimentary, but there's something strikingly effective about it. Each hit is loud and visceral, and many of the actual deaths are a lot more creative than I was expecting them to be, even if the violence leads me up to each death is pretty by-the-numbers.I was pleasantly surprised with the small but satisfying character arcs that the script weaves into the simple story. Santa is given a cynical outlook on humanity and himself to overcome, the family has tension to work out, and the mythology of Santa's backstory is actually given a twist to make his capacity for violence make sense in this movie.There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about any of this, but it's all crafted with care and it's investing enough that I could easily see myself watching this in subsequent years.Its aforementioned strengths help it largely overcome its weak supporting actors, dialogue that's sometimes so corny it's cringey, and its few too many scenes of characters sitting and talking.~benjaminskylerhill rated 7/10 on 2 December 2022"," Brutal delight: Such a wonderful spin on a horror/comedy where Santa Claus is the hero! David Harbor is absolutely perfect for this role has the best voice and great thrill to see in anything he's in! To me this is one of the best Christmas movies out there along with Bad Santa. I would defiantly agree with anyone that loved Violent Night, it's a great mix of Home Alone, John Wick, and any horror Christmas movie. Tommy Wirkola directed a pure blast of entertainment! I sorta can see how it could get hate the family was a little obnoxious at times but I void that out cause everything else positive outweighs heaps.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 2 December 2022"," Santa's got a brand new bag: Greetings again from the darkness. HO-HO-HO! Who is ready for the best ever Santa slasher movie? Admittedly, it's a narrow sub-genre and anyone that knows me or reads my reviews, knows full well that this is not the type of movie I typically recommend. However, it's the season for charity and director Tommy Wirkola (HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS, 2013 - sequel in the works) and co-writers Pat Casey and John Miller (the screenwriters behind the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" films) have gifted us an extremely violent and often very funny Christmas present, replete with a sledgehammer-slinging Santa Claus.We first meet an inebriated Santa (""I'm on a break"") at a local pub, where he explains to a mall Santa why he has become so disenchanted with the job ... greedy, self-centered kids who only want more video games. The booze numbs Santa's disgust as he heads off on his sleigh ... and Wirkola delivers the first shocking moment as Santa's barf keys us into the type of twisted tale we are about to experience. David Harbour (best known for ""Stranger Things"" and HELLBOY, 2019) is absolutely all-in for this far-from-glamorous portrait of jolly ol' Saint Nick. On his rounds, Santa raids household liquor stashes while chomping on cookies and eschewing skim milk. He's a full-blown slob, yet still holds a soft spot for ""nice"" kids, while having little mercy for the ""naughty"" among us.Most of the story takes place at the Lightstone family compound, where one-percenter Gertrude (CHRISTMAS VACATION alum Beverly D'Angelo) is the foul-mouthed matriarch ruling over her entitled and unlikable family consisting of daughter Alva (Edi Patterson) and her airhead-actor husband Morgan (Cam Gigandet) and their poser teenage son Bert (Alexander Elliot). Also present for the festive evening are Gertrude's son Jason (Alex Hassell), his estranged wife Linda (Alexis Louder) and their precious 7-year-old daughter Trudy (Leah Brady). Santa arrives at the Lightstone mansion not long before a team of mercenaries, led by Mr Scrooge (John Leguizamo), storm the place and take the family members hostage. Their mission is to break into the family vault and abscond with $300 million in cash.What follows is a demented mash-up of DIE HARD (1989), HOME ALONE (1990), BAD SANTA (2003), and THOR (2011). Deadly weapons used here include your expected firearms, but also a finely-honed candy cane, an icicle, a skating shoe, and a Christmas tree star, among other holiday items. Most prominent is the sledgehammer wielded by Santa, and the flashback to his pre-Santa days for explanation. The violent action is plentiful, and it's well-balanced with countless lines of comedy. Surprisingly, there is a story nestled in amongst the mayhem, and the heart of it revolves around the bond between Santa and young Trudy. She's a true believer in him and that overrides his uncertainty about the job, and inspires him to stick around for the fight. Santa can't explain the mystique of Christmas ""magic"", but he does know an 1100 year marriage has its ups and downs.Obviously, this is not one for the kiddos (it's a hard R-rating), and they should be shielded from this Yuletide yuck. Director Wirkola has delivered an instant holiday classic for those seeking the bizarro world flicks contrasting to the more respectable family fare of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS STORY. Who would have ever thought that Festivus might be the safer holiday?Opens in theaters on December 2, 2022.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 30 November 2022"," Santa Wick: The first movie I watched in the new year, 2023. I regret not seeing it in the cinema. I really liked the movie. It was fun. It's like a family movie though, with lots of bloody scenes. There was a lot of inexplicable stuff about Santa in the movie. This shows that there will be a second movie. According to me. Acting was good. David Harbor was great again. I liked the movie overall, except for a few cringe scenes. The action scenes weren't bad either. It was a funny movie. It was a movie that didn't take itself seriously, but took it seriously at the same time. I recommend. It was one of the best movies of 2022 for me.~jack_o_hasanov_imdb rated 7/10 on 31 December 2022"," Violent Night is a modern Christmas classic!: If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Violent Night is one of the biggest surprises of the year, instantly becoming a contemporary Christmas classic! David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal, savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messages.Fighting sequences feature truly violent practical stunts, taking advantage of the R rating to provide unmeasurable amounts of gore. Creative use of Christmas songs will leave audiences crying with laughter.A brilliant homage to the seasonal genre classics that should be seen in a packed theater!""Rating: A-~msbreviews rated 8/10 on 30 November 2022"," Definetely how I like to start the season.: As far as Christmas movies go, is this better than Die Hard? Of course not! However, it's no doubt a Christmas movie. David Harbor plays a Santa Claus who lost his Christmas spirit and gets it back by going total medieval on a gang of kidnappers looking to take a small fortune from the type of rich folks you hate the most over the Holiday season. Harbor's Santa reminds me a lot of his version of Hellboy, I think when it comes down to it both pictures are Metal as Hell, and it's like Mr. Stranger Things just doing vocals for both albums. Mr. John Leguizamo is in the flick as the naughtiest of naughty men (not as naughty as Hans Gruber, but who can be). Like a sick guitar riff Leguizamo brings his season experience as an actor to create an interesting and funny bad guy. Leaning towards the Home Alone factor, this movie is as violent as the title suggests, which is rare, really. The little kid in turns out to be worse than Kevin McCallister when it comes to projecting her home from criminal masterminds. It's like someone read the minds of every person that watches Die Hard on Christmas day and just wanted to give us something official. I appreciate that.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 2 December 2022"," Great execution of a beautiful idea: Violent Night may be just 10 mins too long but thankfully that doesn't stop it from executing it's beautiful premise extremely well. A super violent and really funny action movie that doesn't forget to bring the necessary heart and festive spirit as a Christmas movie.David Harbour gives a terrific lead performance as Santa, displaying an emotional range way beyond what's expected and delivering some truly heartwarming moments with Leah Brady who brings a boundless optimism to her adorably innocent character.Tommy Wirkola's direction is great, the action scenes are so much fun to watch, really inventive and always comprehensible. The music by Dominic Lewis is really good, combining the epic action movie pieces with more traditionally festive moments.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 3 December 2022"

Next to me a grown man sobbed the entire way through. I heard sniffles throughout the entire theater. I had to put my popcorn on the ground because it felt inappropriate to eat popcorn while watching this movie. I even felt wrong laying down in my recliner chair, so I moved it in an upright position. This movie holds a great deal of gravity. It's heaviness is devastating, and if you let it, it could flip your world upside down. The whole point of the film is to flip your world, because unfortunately we merely go about life as if these atrocities aren't happening. This movie will try and wake you up to the sick reality of child trafficking. I reckon it will be successful. It's incredibly well done, has a fantastic compelling script, for having little budget on the actor scene, I'd say it's performances were beyond excellent. Even had some real artistically beautiful shots.Great film with an incredibly powerful message.See this movie. Have your friends and family see this movie. Share it with all. Movies as important as this come once in a decade.Let it flip your world.Let it flip the world.~JackRJosie rated 10/10 on 5 July 2023"," Powerful & Important: This was a tough movie to watch. It wasn't graphic, but to see, to an extent, what Tim Ballard saw, really hits right in the heart. The children in the movie were phenomenal actors is helping to understand the innocence and fear that one would go through in being in that situation.My heart went out to each one of them, yet still hurts knowing that they are just actors and there are actual children being sold everyday.There is a great understanding of what Tim Ballard went through to save the children he did. The sacrifice. The pain, and the darkness that lies within the hearts of people that would take children and destroy their souls and lives.I give this movie a high rating because it wasn't just a good movie, it was a wake up call to all people that there are atrocities occurring everyday towards children and it needs to stop. I appreciate everything this movie sets out to accomplish and it was so well done. It wasn't graphic, but it told the story that needed to be told the way it needed to be told.~3DForMe rated 10/10 on 5 July 2023"," Powerful: Powerful story about an impossibly difficult topic. Beautifully shot, incredibly compelling, amazing performances (the kids!!!!), gorgeous set design, and that it's based on a true story makes it even better.Jim Caviezel is incredible in his role as is Bill Camp. I really wish Mira Sorvino had a bigger part as her character is strong and such an encourager (maybe the next movie will be about Tim's wife? I don't want to give it away - but she's a hero too!)Bravo to the filmmakers for shining a light on a topic that I'm sure most people don't realize just how big this issue is.It's an action thriller with a big call to action. Go see it - then go be a part of the solution!~loriincali rated 9/10 on 1 July 2023"," I don't want to believe it, but I do.: Every parent's worst nightmare is a reality for some. How is that possible?! This is a hard reality to address. I admire Tim Ballard and James Caviezel's dedication to this plight. Caviezel did an amazing acting job-as always. Was I uncomfortable during parts of the movie? I was, and everyone should be!! There is nothing graphic, but you understand what's happening. We need to be more aware of these things and be watchful and alert with our own children and all children!! For this reason I recommend that you see this movie. It will help us all to be more vigilant. Beyond that, it was entertaining and held our attention for what is usually considered a very long movie.~tresadawn rated 10/10 on 1 June 2023"," A fantastic movie that I'll never watch again: After I watched Sound of Freedom, I felt the same as having just watched The Road. It was a deeply powerful movie, but the subject matter is so disturbing that it's difficult to bear it.Sound of Freedom is an expertly shot, gripping, and powerful movie. At the end, I wanted to cry and vomit, yet those are not criticisms of the movie, it's the realization that this sickness actually happens every day all over the world. This movie is The Road + Taken, and amped up 500 times.Jim Cavezel gives an incredible performance. The directing, pacing, and cinematography are perfect. This is definitely one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen, yet I'll probably never watch it again, because my heart won't be able to take it.~notagardeningchannel rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"," So heartbreaking and powerful: This is an absolute must see! Whether you have kids or not, makes no difference this movie is for everyone. If you have children, I suggest you have them watch with you because everybody needs to wake up to what is going on in this world! AN's children need to be very aware of their surrounding. I know it's scary, but better safe than sorry IMO. Im sad to know that in our country, of these United States, we are some of the worlds worst! Although this movie is absolutely heartbreaking, it also gives you a little bit of hope. Because we know God is with us, but also we know there are some really good people out there trying to make a change. Putting their lives on the line, putting their families in danger whether it be because their mom or dad is not coming home because they lay their life on the line to save somebody else's child, or they're made as cops/informants and families are killed. They are all heroes! I wondered as I was sitting in the theater watching this movie...in the two hours I was there I wondered how many children were trafficked or how many were sexually abused. It is absolutely heartbreaking and it is very real.~cscott2331 rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"," Do You Hear That?: ""Sound of Freedom"" is based on the true story of Tim Ballard as he tries to rescue abducted children from sex traffickers. The movie was produced by ""Angel Studios"", and actually was made back in 2018 but faced a number of delays and finally saw the light of day in 2023.It is important to be able to separate the theme of a movie, with the quality of the movie. I am 100% in agreement with the movie's message. Child slavery is an awful thing and this great evil should be stamped out. But that isn't the question, the question is: How is the movie? It is pretty good.It is a very tightly edited, there is not a wasted minute of screen time. It is very well acted, from Cavizel to the children, there was not a performance in the film that I didn't believe. The music was also good, it set up the suspense and enhanced the action.Don't be fooled by the marketing and genre, I wouldn't really consider this film an ""action movie"". It is much more a drama. They do a good job with suspense, but for the most part it is more focused on the depth of the situation. When they do action, it isn't all that well edited. But I do understand, that is not the focus of the film.The movie also loses me as it approaches its final act. Most of the film felt grounded and real, it is based on a true story after all. But then the movie adds a bonus scene, that feels like it is from a different film. It may have happened in real life, I am just saying in the film, it felt out of place.Overall, it is a really good film. I am glad it is doing well. I like seeing some lower budget films get a chance to shine, and I do think it has an important message to share. Let freedom ring.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 9 August 2023"," Go see it!: I was able to watch a screening of this film and WOW! It was powerful, eye-opening, heart-wrenching yet hopeful. I'm hopeful that millions of people will see this film, that more can become aware of the horrific atrocities that are happening to God's children.The acting was superb. Jim is freaking amazing at what he does. He really made me feel the emotional torment that his character struggled through. I was anticipating a slower moving film but it was fast-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat. It kept me begging to please allow for a satisfactory ending. I wanted to see everyone get what they deserved. Unfortunately, this is real life and not everything has a happy ending. No spoilers at all - the ending is great but left me wanting to know what I can do to help end trafficking. How can I be more aware. What organizations are there to support.Go see this film!~mikeyou-61117 rated 10/10 on 1 June 2023"," Addresses a Difficult Topic in an Powerful Way: I was really impressed with this film. At first thought, I didn't think I wanted to watch a movie about child trafficking. I felt like they would have made it graphic and evil. But this movie didn't do that. Instead of making you feel disgusting inside about the awfulness of child trafficking, it instead made you hopeful that something can be done about it.The overall cinematography, storytelling, and interesting music made this film a perfect set-up for a powerful message. I only took off the one star because I think some of the acting could have been slightly improved, but the film still got it's point across: God's children are not for sale!~calebtshelton rated 9/10 on 24 May 2023"," Don't be afraid to see this.: I was worried there might be things in this movie that would cause trauma. There are no explicit scenes. That being said, this is an important movie and every parent should see it. Not only that, I would recommend it for teens as well. The acting, the script and the whole presentation is first rate. I think about this story, and it is true, and it cuts deep. It also keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Sometimes movies with a message can be either over the top or boring. This was neither. You could hear a pin drop in the theater through most of the film. I hope you will give this movie a chance. You won't regret it and it may open your awareness in a way that could save a child's life (Maybe even your own).~ErinsGloma rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"

It oversells the opening credits death of his son. While I understand it's the crux of the motivation, we get 30 minutes of his suffering before he decides to do a thing. Feels emotionally manipulative, wringing every last drop of milk from the tragedy to the point where it can't be called a fun action film in the least. The entire film is dialogue free, which works for him since he loses his voice, but becomes a big, dumb gimmick as every character in the film is given an excuse not to speak. One is gagged, one cries and texts the entire film, one is simply quiet and stoic and the rest grunt and groan to fill the gaping void. So finally, after a long cliched montage of him body building and gun training (and why he needs to be extra ripped I don't understand, but I'll buy it). He has a year to plan the perfect revenge and what does he do? Drives up, makes a lot of noise, makes every mistake imaginable & is constantly getting beat up and luck saves him every single time. Bad guys aim for his bullet proof vest over and over again, they give him long cool looks instead of just shooting him as he loudly makes himself an eye sore in every situation, never using even the smallest amount of stealth. He decides not to shoot a woman who just unambiguously just shot at him to kill him, which obviously doesn't go well for him. He tells the bad guys he's coming for him and is surprised that they best him. The lead bad guy decides to dance with his girl for like 10 minutes in slow motion as he is killing all his guys in what is possibly the most over decorated art direction ever in a movie... his lair looks like a groovy Los Angeles art installation or something meow wolf would dream up, hardly a gang member's decorating style. He sees his son in things and plays with his toys over and over stopping the action in its tracks. And finally, why are all the gang members cliches from 1990's movies? Why are they squatting and squaring off in abandoned ruins of buildings? Don't they have anywhere better to be? This movie was a boring, ridiculous, mess. John Woo tried his best to make it interesting visually, but the hyper style that worked in films like Face/Off never stops and makes it feel even more dramatically over the top.~actaction rated 4/10 on 6 December 2023"," Not impressed. Pretty action visuals, but severely lacking in real thrill and credibility: Director John Woo got world famous for his fabulous action visuals during the nineties. This picture still looks the part, but that is about the only positive I can find...The bad: the action only starts after 50 minutes. Besides an action packed opening scene of a few minutes no thrilling action to be seen during the first 50 minutes.Is the action any good then? Well yes and no. As I said before, the action looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame. Credibility near zero.More bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork. And although there is one big, bad crime guy who was supposed to be the ultimate evil, but he wasnt impressing me either.I had hoped for a thrilling action packed gangster movie, but it was quite a bit of a dread to watch though...~imseeg rated 5/10 on 4 December 2023"," No dialog absolutely ruins this film, among other things: I respect John Woo's decision to try to make a film with no dialog and the story to be expressed through his imagery rather than a script. The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen. I'm going to rewatch Face/Off to make me forget this film ever happened.0.5 shots in the neck out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 2/10 on 5 December 2023"," Why the bad reviews?: I'm not sure if the reviewers watched the same movie as me. I found this film packed with cool stunts and action sequences. I got both John Wick and The Raid vibes while watching it. Some scenes even reminded me of something out of GTA V.Even though there wasn't much plot in the movie and no dialogues whatsoever, I think the film is carried forward by Joel Kinnaman's excellent acting. Not many big action stars could pull off the same.All in all, I found it an entertaining and excellent action film. Just switch of your brain and enjoy it. I'm probably going to watch it again. I'll rate it 8/10.~allankaaber rated 8/10 on 21 December 2023"," Action speaks louder than words: This being a new action movie directed by John Woo is what got me interested in the movie, along with it being a Christmas action movie starring actor Joel Kinnaman; other than that, the fact that main character loses his voice is what also got me interested on how the movie was going to go. The Christmas action movie Silent Night (2023) is a fun by the numbers revenge film that has good performances, good cinematography, and fun action; the movie is not perfect, because of how it could take the premise farther or impacted the character.Joel Kinnaman gives an exceptionally satisfactory performance not saying anything throughout the movie because of his character losing his voice and gives a lot of facial expressions to show what he is feeling right in the situation, with an occasional raspy yell and talking with his wife by texting at one point. He gets revenge for his son being killed, and there are a lot of moments where you can tell he is upset and is reminiscing everything he did with his son; most of the movie is him getting ready to put his revenge into effect, which was cool to see, and him getting info on certain gang members for the police to turn in. I would have liked if him losing his voice effected his revenge plan in a way that makes sense, so there was a bit more suspense in a way when he is trying to communicate with other people to help them in certain shoot outs.The antagonists are just standard gangs on the streets that are there to be killed in many brutal and bloody ways that are fun to watch; the action sequences are mostly well shot with particularly good cinematography like with shoot outs and car chases, but some action scenes could have reduced the number of cuts that were used. What I thought was impressive was that there are no lines of dialogue from every person throughout the entire movie, except in radio transmissions and in small whispers at times; I like how it focuses on facial expressions to get character's feelings across, but I would have liked some dialogue from the side characters since the main character cannot say anything.I can see why there are people who will hate this movie, but I thought Silent Night (2023) was a fun action movie that had an impressive performance from Joel Kinnaman, and well-done cinematography in the fun action scenes; there are issues like it being like all other action revenge movies, but it is entertaining to watch. Director John Woo has done a respectable job directing, and if you like him as a director, I recommend this movie; not a must watch, but it is a fun Christmas action movie to watch whenever you get the chance.~Cinema-reviewer321 rated 7/10 on 24 December 2023"," Should have been better: Watching John Woo's ""Silent Night"" and as much as I hate to admit it, I'm kind of bored.Also, the lack of dialogue from ANYONE is just weird. Sure, he can't talk due to being shot (it's in the trailer, hardly a spoiler) but the others haven't been shot. Having no one else speak just takes away the impact of the MC losing his own voice.I'm also struggling with the fact this guy has zero training but thinks he is going to take on the whole criminal underworld - training himself with YouTube videos in his basement.I guess, all I'm saying is, if you want a decent ""You shot my kid, I must kill you all"" revenge film - check out Kevin Bacon's ""Death Sentence"".~shawthingproductions rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," An unfortunate misfire: I hate to say, I'm overall disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy this but it fell flat for me. I figured John Woo going back to straight up action will be a treat. Instead of using the idea of a dialogueless action flick as an interesting device he creates a very drab story that is less than appealing. He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up. It's like he never watched a silent movie and saw how you can tell a compelling story with minimal dialogue. He just leans on lame cliches. Also there's too many logocal errors, even for an action movie. And Joel Kinnaman, who I normally like, makes a less than appealing protagonist. Even without speaking his character seems annoying. An unfortunate misfire from something that had a lot of potential.~bpete333 rated 4/10 on 8 December 2023"," Mute. Pause. Hit. Repeat.: SILENT NIGHT (2023) ** Joel Kinnaman, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Kid Cudi. John Woo's disappointing action revenge flick with Kinnaman seeking vengeance on gangbangers who accidentally killed his son on Christmas has so much potential but is squandered in its hole-laden script by Robert Archer Lynn (i.e. Namely the sadly misused talent of Sandino Moreno as the spouse who basically just passively cries while her husband for months on end is holed up in their basement preparing for war). While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job). A few decent set pieces sadly cannot make up for a half-baked update on DEATH WISH and its ilk.~george.schmidt rated 6/10 on 8 December 2023"," This is not up to John Woo's talent, and left me very dissatisfied.: This is not up to John Woo's talent. I found the material entirely like a one-trick pony. All rage, and sadness, verging on insanity, without any real character development, or pathos. There is nothing in the lead character's story that allows the audience to sympathize with him, other than the loss of his son. There are no positive events to draw us into the story. Instead, we are faced with an ever-increasing level of horror, rage, and madness. Woo has been known to give violence an almost ballet type of choreography (Bullet time slow motion) but that is not what we are seeing here. With the rage of the main character, we are faced with depression, rage, and madness which causes an ever-increasing degree of violence that continues to the very end of the film. This film should have ratings of extreme violence attached. While I watched the entire film I was left with a deep feeling of disatisfaction when it was over. It almost feels like the film was only part of a story.~lenwenzellw rated 4/10 on 20 December 2023"," Subverting Your Expectations (for the worse): I saw this movie for free and still wish I had not.Every trailer that I saw for this movie alluded to this being an action packed revenge saga. However, you get a taste of action within the first 7 minutes or so and then you have to wait approximately 60 minutes for your next dose and even then, during the last half-hour, you get maybe 15 minutes of action. So, out of 104 minutes you get 22 minutes of action.I do not like being lied to about the type of movie I am going to see and you probably would not like that either so I am trying to help you out here. What I would like to see is this movies gross drop off of a clip next weekend because of their deceptive practices.The soundtrack was garbage and forgetable (those songs I do remember were trash and those I don't ... well I guess I forgot).You want to know what else is forgetable?

I. M. P."" to my playlist, I probably wouldn't have known how to react. It was unexpected to see the presence of the theme in a French legal drama, and even more surprising was its prominence in addressing some of the film's central themes. But despite appearances, ""Anatomie d'une chute"" is anything but a typical dull legal drama.I admit that your experience with this film may vary depending on your level of engagement with the work, as your experience will be greatly affected by how much this film can draw you into its world, its characters, and their nuances. At its core is a mysterious death.There are various ways to approach this story. It could have been an investigative thriller in the style of David Fincher, but it's not. Justine Triet knows exactly what she wants to extract from it. She is more interested in showing it through the eyes of the people involved and does an astonishing job in this regard. Rather than the quest for the truth, the script is more concerned with how people react to the bits of information they come across. It also aims to demonstrate the complexity of human relationships and the path that leads to certain decisions in the lives of couples that can never be fully understood by an external audience filled with prejudices and snap judgments. The media attention surrounding the trial that occupies almost the entirety of the last two acts of this film demonstrates that the truth is not always the most important aspect. It also shows that the judgment of a specific moment or action is less significant for the audience than a character judgment that is always waiting to be passed.The way this is all filmed surprised me greatly. Triet doesn't seek a classical and comfortable approach. The blocking is phenomenal, making us feel almost like intruders. The camera's movements are also unstable, approaching the emotionally unstable characters. It's a mastery that few possess, not because few know how to do it technically, but because few can do it so effectively, eliciting the emotional response desired from the audience. For instance, there's a scene in which a third party speaks about the deceased. The camera first focuses on Daniel (Milo Machado Graner), the son, who is visibly uncomfortable but tries to hide it. Then it shifts to Sandra (Sandra HÃ¼ller), and we can see the same discomfort in her as she tries to make eye contact with her son. It moved me and brought tears to my eyes. The foreground here wasn't the dialogue but how it was affecting these people.What Milo Machado Graner, one of the most impressive performances by a young actor, and especially Sandra HÃ¼ller do in this film is sensational. HÃ¼ller brings an impressive array of expressive tools that always work according to the moment when they are put into action. When she tries to seduce, when she fights, when she opens up, when she closes off, when she feels invincible, when she feels vulnerable. Her micro-expressions and body language convey everything she has to say, and I must say that I consider this performance among the best I've ever seen. It's spine-chilling.With this, I'm afraid I might be doing a disservice to the supporting actors, which would be unfair because they all deliver outstanding performances. In addition to the previously mentioned young actor, Swann Arlaud plays the eloquent defense lawyer and friend who becomes increasingly close to Sandra. Antoine Reinartz portrays a powerful prosecutor with a speech as intense as it is well-crafted. Samuel Theis shines in an incredible scene from the past. And speaking of that scene... what an immense kitchen argument, so well-crafted, packed with information, filled with conflicting emotions, repressed feelings, and expertly edited to the point where all you can do is open your mouth in admiration of such a work of art. After all, this film is about several falls, and no scene could better exemplify the most significant fall than that one.Although this is not the easiest film to watch, demanding a lot from the viewer, especially until the end of the first act, the way everything unfolds, the development of its script, and the paths and destinations of its thematic approach are absolutely fascinating. It is one of the most realistically human films in its approach to unknown facts. It doesn't aim for flashy cinematic spectacle, but it provides plenty to engage your gray matter every time you think about it.What happens inside each home is truly known only to those who live there. The truths. The half-truths. ""Anatomie d'une chute"" is a magnificent realistic exercise in the search for a truth that isn't always attainable, forcing everyone else to navigate in an uncertain but necessary zone of conscious decision-making. Sandra HÃ¼ller delivers one of the best performances in history. Period. Chilling.~PedroPires90 rated 9/10 on 6 November 2023"," A (crime?) drama of the finest quality! [+83%]: The beauty of the film truly lies in how delicately it's paced throughout. Even when it takes the shape of a courtroom drama with great attention to detail, it still rests firmly on the emotional bonding between the lead characters - in this case, a mother (Sandra), her son (Daniel), and their dog. That never takes a backseat, despite the film turning into a murder mystery (of sorts) at several points. I absolutely loved the performances here, be it Sandra HÃ¼ller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado Graner, and Samuel Theis. And for all it's worth, the standout here is Snoop (the dog), and his presence not only drives the story forward at a pivotal juncture, but this wonderful canine also takes the audience's perspective in the beginning and at the end of the film. He's travelling with these characters just like us, while also playing the role of an unconditional guardian angel to Daniel.When the writing digs deep into the intricacies of a marriage, it is poignant, relatable, and hard-hitting. Both the husband and the wife are writers essentially, and that makes their struggles and little victories all the more accessible. The changing dynamics in their relationship is brought to light through superbly shot flashbacks (just as their audio recordings are being played in court), and we as audiences, understand what each half of the couple is going through. The journey is dramatic alright, but since the outcome determines whether the mother gets to reunite with her son after a long, drawn-out trial, it always remains riveting to watch. The ""lesser"" moments - like a scene that depicts Sandra and her lawyer friend drinking together, are also beautifully staged.~arungeorge13 rated 8/10 on 15 October 2023"," Sandra HÃ¼ller and Milo Machado Graner give stunning performances: It's a legal drama set in the recent past in a chalet in the French Alps near Grenoble and a courtroom in Grenoble, France. It follows the investigation and trial of a female novelist charged with the death of her husband, also a novelist.Sandra Voyter (Sandra HÃ¼ller) is a successful German novelist. While studying in Great Britain, she met her husband, Samuel Maleski (Samuel Theis), a French-background university lecturer and aspiring novelist. They have an 11-year-old son, Daniel (Milo Machado Graner), who suffered an injury at age four that seriously affected his eyesight. They have moved to Samuel's home community near Grenoble because he thought this would aid his writing. They speak English and French at home; Samuel doesn't speak German, and Sandra believes her French is not strong. Clearly, the marriage has been troubled since Daniel's accident, which took place in a traffic accident while Daniel was in Samuel's care.The movie opens with Sandra being interviewed by a graduate student, ZoÃ© Solidor (Camille Rutherford). Samuel is working in the chalet's attic, installing insulation and playing music louder and louder, forcing the interview to end. When ZoÃ© leaves, Daniel takes his dog, Snoop, for a walk. When he returns, he discovers Samuel dead on the ground after a fall from the third-floor attic. Sandra claims she was asleep until she heard Daniel's scream.The circumstances of Samuel's death launch an investigation. Did Samuel fall? Was he pushed? Did he jump? What caused his significant head wound? The authorities eventually charge Sandra with murder. Her lawyer, Vincent Renzi (Swann Arlaud), has an earlier history with Sandra and seems uncertain about his beliefs about her role. The trial does come to a believable conclusion.Sandra HÃ¼ller and Milo Machado Graner give stunning performances. ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is one the best legal dramas I've seen for a long time. I can't speak to the accuracy of the French courtroom scenes; it's markedly different than North American and English courts in the wide-ranging manner of witness interrogation that involves the accused all along the way, and both the prosecutor and defense lawyers take great liberty to insert argument amid questioning. But the audience learns just a little more at each turn through the slow unfolding of Sandra's and Samuel's marriage through the testimony.If you like legal dramas, ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is highly recommended.~steiner-sam rated 9/10 on 28 October 2023"," Anatomy of a Fall: There are so many things I got from this after watching it. So many subtle little thing that throw shade over both characters, thus showing such complex humans with flaws and virtues.Technically it does not stand out but it's servicable for the themes and story. Was this the perfect long-game psychological crime? That last scene speaks volumes. The last courtroom scene with the kid was devestating and conclusive, even if that lawyer tried to flip it. Even him knew the conclusion at that moment. It was cathartic.It was a very devastating and powerful film. I would very much like to see it again so I can absorb that excellent dialogue all over again.~M0n0_bogdan rated 9/10 on 21 October 2023"," Remarkable: This movie runs 150 minutes, but I was never bored or distracted. The script is taught, the direction intriguing. Certain scenes, like when the boy is being questioned by two opposing lawyers at the same time, so that he is constantly turning his head back and forth to look at each in turn, are very clever.Almost half this movie is in English, so even people who don't like subtitles should give it a try.I haven't seen Anatomy of a Murder in years, so I can't say if there are any references to it. I do remember, however, that I didn't think it was a great movie.This, however, has greatness written all over it.~richard-1787 rated 10/10 on 6 September 2023"," A deep yet entertaining take on the courtroom drama: Anatomy of a Fall is a French film that explores the ambiguity of how we create notions of the truth through complexity of a criminal case. The film refuses to answer the question of guilt or innocence, but rather examines how people construct their own narratives based on partial and biased information. The film shows how gender, media, and personal motives influence the interpretation of the facts. The son of the accused, who is the only witness, admits that he does not know what really happened, and that he has to make a choice about what to believe. The prosecutor, who seems to have a personal vendetta against the accused, also relies on assumptions and speculations rather than solid evidence. The film is a compelling and nuanced study of human psychology and social dynamics. The film is well-acted and directed, but it could have been shorter. Some scenes in the courtroom are repetitive and drag on for too long.~dngoldman rated 8/10 on 29 October 2023"," More than one Truth: A lonely chalet in the French Alps. A dead man laying in the snow in front of it. Apparently he fell out of the third floor window under the roof.Was it an accident? Suicide? Or a murderess attack? Whoever expects a conventional crime thriller with a final simple solution will be badly disappointed by this complex psychological drama about a female author fighting for her independence, dignity and her own truth in the courtroom, where she stands under suspicion to have killed her husband. But beware: truth has different aspects and different sides, depending on whoever tries to catch it. It comes in disguises, often invisible, always subjective.In the end it's up to the viewer to make up his own mind about the case. While the investigation is unfolded Triets movie proudly walks in the footsteps of Ingmar Bergman, a classic analyst of complicated couple relationships and she truly succeeds in doing so.~berndgeiling rated 7/10 on 5 November 2023"," Deep and subtle: Amazing script, wonderful acting (Sandra HÃ¼ller is absolutely fantastic!), subtle music and skillful camera work: the film is interesting to watch, the twists are unpredictable and every next moment it digs deeper into the intricacies and imperfections in the relationship of a wealthy intellectual middle-aged couple. One of the partners appears emotionally stronger than the other, so they get over their family dramas and tragedies in different ways, to such an extent that it ends up with one of the partners dead and the other in court, charged with murder. This is how we are gradually exposed to the skeletons in their cupboards and feel free to recognize some of them as our own. Gives a lot of food for thought and discussion. Fantastic movie!~thebeachlife rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," A Plunging Composition...: An accident or an incident that then starts examination, as your world is then dissected and the roots pulled from foundations, interpretation and translation, vague and cryptic information, that may leave you with some years of deep reflective contemplation. Forensically the life you've led is stripped and searched - examined, layers of your soul removed just like a rabbit that's being skinned, to reveal the facts through diction, or is this all a work of fiction, as you try to wrench yourself from the state's cross to which you've been pinned. Just to complicate the picture there's a son who's in despair, the gaze that he once owned is now long lost - beyond repair, making sense of what's gone on, recollections are redrawn, perhaps the dog's the only one who really knew what's come and gone.Sandra HÃ¼ller is quite spectacular.~Xstal rated 8/10 on 12 November 2023"," The legal drama I've been waiting for: Anatomy of a Fall is an engrossing courtroom drama that packs a miniseries' worth of story in two and a half hours. I totally see why it garnered so much acclaim from the festival circuit! It is exactly the kind of legal drama I've wanted to see for years. THIS is the standard of crime genre that all other films now have to live up to. Thoughtful, intricate and emotional. The writing is phenomenal - it takes a lot of guts to do two hours of court proceedings but wow, it's enthralling; so meticulously plotted and presented, with such intricate explorations of the complexities of relationships. It's the kind of thought-provoking procedural where the truth is never certain and the power is granted to the audience to determine its true outcome. Sandra HÃ¼ller is extraordinary in a cant-look-away performance that will grip you from beginning to end, but if I'm being honest, everyone here is incredible. It has one of the best child performances I've ever seen in a film. Even the dog put in a performance of a lifetime! Taut, suspenseful and compelling until the final moment, the film progresses like a heady puzzle that tackles the messiness of existence and the often elusive nature of truth itself. Anatomy of a Fall is truly all-around exceptional filmmaking!~parksiet rated 9/10 on 5 November 2023"
A Haunting in Venice (2023) - IMDb,6.5,Kenneth Branagh|Michelle Yeoh|Jamie Dornan|Tina Fey|Dylan Corbett-Bader|Amir El-Masry|Riccardo Scamarcio|Fernando Piloni|Lorenzo Acquaviva|David Menkin|Camille Cottin|Kelly Reilly|Jude Hill|Yaw Nimako-Asamoah|Clara Duczmal|Rowan Robinson|Emma Laird|Stella Harris,Kenneth Branagh,Michael Green|Agatha Christie,"In post-World War II Venice, Poirot, now retired and living in his own exile, reluctantly attends a seance. But when one of the guests is murdered, it is up to the former detective to once again uncover the killer."," A good adaptation of a tricky book.: Poirot, now retired, and living in exile, is convinced by his friend Ariadne Oliver, to look into the honesty and integrity of a medium, who's set to visit bereaved mother Rowena Drake.If you're going into this one hoping for authenticity, you may be a little disappointed, I recently read the book, and aside from a few names and events, it is only very loosely based on the book.Authenticity to one side, I really did enjoy this movie, talk about an interesting choice, you can understand why Death on The Nile and Orient Express were chosen, but Halloween Party doesn't exactly lend itself well to an adaptation, but overall it works very well, plenty of plus points.The main winner, the visuals, with Venice they were never going to fail I guess, it looks sensational, but the camera angles and focuses are really nice, very atmospheric and suitably sinister, a shame a few scenes couldn't have been just a tad brighter. The masks, robes and costumes looked so good, they really did give it a Halloween vibe.I'd say this is Brannagh's most accomplished turn as Poirot so far, the toned down moustache has definitely made a difference, he feels more like Poirot.Well acted all round, Kelly Reilly is no stranger to Agatha Christie, she's excellent as Rowena, and as for the young man that played Leopold, he was great.My one gripe, Ariadne, I'm not knocking Tina Fey, she did a good job, but when you read the books, I just don't see her as an American glamour puss, I wonder if we'll see her again.I'm awarding an extra point for the fact that Branagh chose Halloween Party, and didn't opt for Evil under The Sun or Appointment with Death, but I wouldn't be surprised if one of those was number four.It worked well, 8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 15 September 2023"," A Haunting In Venice: Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has retired and is living in Venice where he is visited by his old friend Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey) who asks him to come to a seance held in a palatial Venetian house by top medium played by Michelle Yeoh who is seeking to speak with the spirit of a girl who apparently killed herself jumping from the building. Oliver wants Poirot to expose Yeoh as a fraud or start believing in the afterlife. He attends and there is a murder.Branagh's third go at a Poirot story and depending on your fondness for these things, potentially the best. It is very different from the previous 2 mysteries in that whilst the usual interviews and ripping up of alibis takes place, there is a very distinct supernatural element here, which may or may not be real. What Branagh does though is use this to create a much darker and decidedly well crafted spooky story (he should definitely make a straight ghost story) which is looking both for a murderer and proof that the ghostly bit is true or false. So whilst the gloss and usual extravagant beautifully dressed characters might be missing there is still a great mystery to enjoy. I hope he does another one.~henry8-3 rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Best of the three: A Haunting in Venice is the best of Kenneth Branagh's trilogy of Poirot adventures. This one being a smaller scale whodunit with a supernatural edge fixes any remaining issues whilst still being an engaging mystery with a satisfying answer to whodunit.Kenneth Branagh is still endlessly entertaining as Hercule Poirot, the humour is toned down here due to the darker story and yet again he's grown as a character by the end. Each one has tested something different, first it was his morality then his humanity and here it's his sanity that is pushed to breaking point.The cast is still undeniably star studded but still smaller than the predecessor which means no one goes unnoticed. Highlights include Tina Fey who makes for a great double act with Branagh's Poirot and Michelle Yeoh, given her best role in a Western film in ages (excluding EEAAO of course).Mostly being confined to one smaller, interior heavy location, Branagh's direction is even better that what's come before. His trademark canted angles have never been more at home and even though the film isn't massively scary, Branagh is still able to craft some effectively uncomfortable moments.Thanks to the location this franchise is finally free of the distracting CG that's been its biggest flaw. Being majority practical just makes the whole thing infinitely more immersive and means the stylish visual composition on display isn't having to make up for shoddy effects.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," SUPER FUN!: Started with some beautiful shots of Venice and instantly I was captured by how beautifully shot this film is. This was a really good Poirot.

When one of the guests is murdered, the detective is thrust into a sinister world of shadows and secrets.~andrewchristianjr rated 8/10 on 14 September 2023"," Ken really does love his Dutch angles: Whereas the last two Branagh Agatha Christie adaptations were movies I sort of liked at first and started to realise were ""meh"" over time, this latest entry is one that I recognised as mediocre upon first viewing.Granted, it was really refreshing to see that this time, the filmmakers clearly put effort into the locations and production design. The film looks authentic and gorgeous, as opposed to its predecessors that were over reliant on unnecessary CGI backgrounds.The story does have some interesting ideas and compelling character interactions, but they unfortunately take a back seat half the time. For the other half, we get a lot of weak attempts at horror and red herring plot points that really do amount to nothing.I don't know what happened with the performances, but half of them are pretty great and the others are...well, awful. The actors clearly didn't agree on what kind of movie they were in, with some thinking it ought to be straight drama and others thinking they should play it corny.Like the previous films, this is a middling whodunnit, with all the rote machinations you expect from the genre, nothing shocking, nothing gripping, but nothing so bad as to tank the experience.It's the definition of mediocre.~benjaminskylerhill rated 5/10 on 15 September 2023"," If You Liked Orient Express and Death on the Nile this won't disappoint: A Haunting in Venice is the third film in the now Poirot trilogy directed and starring Kenneth Branagh. I'm a very casual Poirot viewer. My only exposure to the character is through these films and the British tv series, which I watched long ago and barely remember. As someone who has never read a Poirot novel, I personally liked the previous two films by Branagh, Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. I know many Agatha Christie fans do not, and I can understand why given that these films are not extremely loyal to the source material from what I'm told, especially this film.I haven't read the novel, A Halloween Party, but I'm told the only thing this film has in common with it is that it takes place on Halloween, and that there is a Halloween party in it. The culprit is the same in both, but the motivation and victims are entirely different. I'm guessing Branagh went with a far more obscure Poirot story this time, banking on the fact that not many have read and so they won't notice the many alterations made to it.However, as someone who is only a casual fan, just like with the last two films, I'll be judging this solely as a standalone piece and not an adaptation. From that viewpoint, I think the movie is good. Like with the last two movies, the film looks great, is wonderfully shot. This one evokes a strong haunting, Halloween atmosphere. The acting is good by everyone involved, even the child actors.The film is also significantly shorter than the previous two, though in some ways to the film's detriment. I felt Poirot solved the mystery a bit too quickly. The pacing is a bit rushed at the end, and I'm not entirely convinced of how Poirot comes to the conclusions he does.Despite that, the film is a fun mystery/haunting story. A fun movie to watch, especially around Halloween. I would still say I still like Murder on the Orient Express the most. But I would put this film slightly above Death on the Nile. If you're someone who likes the previous to films in this series, there's no reason not to check this out.~mitchell5954 rated 8/10 on 16 September 2023"," Dark and brooding ho hum plot: My Review- A Haunting in VeniceMy Rating 6/10I was underwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh's latest interpretation of an Agatha Christie novel this one is based on her 1969 novel Halloween Party .It was written late in the authors life to luke warm reviews one critic Robert Weaver wrote - Halloween Party is a disappointment,but with all her accomplishments is Christie can be forgiven some disappointments Poirot seems weary and so does the book.It was filmed previously in 2010 for television starring my favourite Hercule Poirot David Suchet which I watched only after seeing A Haunting in Venice.I must admit Kenneth Branagh who I like in some roles and not others is my least favourite characterisation of Hercule Poirot.His first effort in 2017 Murder on the Orient Express also underwhelmed me but did exceedingly well at the box office however his last effort in 2022 Death on the Nile flopped and for me also had nothing of the grandeur or appeal of the original film adaptations.All that needs to said about the plot line in this whodunnit is that Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot investigates a murder while attending a Halloween seance at a haunted palazzo in Venice, Italy.I was expecting more from this new original adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Halloween Party that's set in the mysterious and spectacular city of Venice because it's a story I didn't know and I had no preconceived expectations.Spectacular Venice is featured in the start and conclusion of this film but it's mostly set indoors in a gloomy gothic villa that could have been built on any movie set.A Haunting in Venice for me fails in a few aspects primarily because of its dark gothic reworking from Kenneth Branagh. It's probably his best Hercule Poirot performance but for me his interpretation of the novel lacks The Agatha Christie touch of humour, eccentric characters and is trying to be something it's not a gothic horror movie it's not really scary at all just dark and brooding.After I saw this movie I watched the 2010 television movie Hallowe'en Party starring David Suchet my favourite Hercule Poirot that bares no resemblance to A Haunting in Venice . It's not her greatest story but the television version has humour and lightness as well as suspense and the performances are much more impressive in my opinion.There are some interesting actors in the cast of A Haunting in Venice including Michelle Yeoh who dropped out of The action adventure 2024 film The Electric State to star in this movie. Why she chose to do this I'm not sure because her role as the clairvoyant Mrs Reynolds is more a short cameo role as is Jamie Dornan's who plays Dr Ferrier .The main supporting role is Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver a crime writer but she didn't shine for me either. Tina Fey plays a similar role in Only Murders in the Building as Cinda Canning but that role is edgy and funny which she does best .With a much more modest production budget of $60 million than his last Agatha Christie move Death in Venice Kenneth Branagh who also directs this movie in my view features himself as Poirot more at the expense of the ensemble characters which is a mistake in an Agatha Christie movie.~tm-sheehan rated 6/10 on 15 September 2023"," Branagh's best Poirot film yet: I have loved everything about Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot series so far. So to see that his next adaption was going to be a fresh one and be more along the lines of horror - sign me up immediately. And the film lived up to the anticipation. If you don't get goosebumps when Poirot says, ""Tell the police not to worry, Hercule Poirot is on the case"" then you need to check your pulse. What an incredible character.Venice is such a terrific setting for a film. I've loved it (and been haunted by it) ever since seeing 1973's 'Don't Look Now'. The final scene in that movie will haunt me until the day I die. Even though 'A Haunting in Venice' is mostly set inside a closed building, Branagh continues to find ways to remind you just how great this setting is throughout the film.The mystery itself is really well done. I wasn't familiar with the story at all and it certainly stumped me and had me impressed once everything was revealed. The cast, while perhaps not quite as star-packed as the previous two installments, all still do an excellent job and play their roles well.I really enjoyed this film. I have no idea whether Branagh plans to stop at three or keep going, but I promise I will continue to watch them as long as he's involved. He has proven he very much knows what he's doing. 9/10.~jtindahouse rated 9/10 on 14 September 2023"," bizarre camerawork: The film is a nonstop parade of extremely wide angle shots done from extremely high or extremely low positions. That and tons of dutch angles. If you get motion sick, avoid this!Usually those kinda camera tricks are used sparingly for a very specific effect. When used constantly, they lose impact and begin to confuse the audience (and make them nauseous!).Then, the script. It's silly and thin. The acting is all around just fine. But the lines and situations are dumb. Branagh can act, but his impression of a Belgian man is... uh... embarrassing.Finally, who is loving this stuff? It deviates incredibly far from Christie's stories, that I can't imagine too many hardcore fans liking this. Plus, when you have a rich history of David Suchet and Joan Hickson turning in fantastic performances as Christie's beloved characters; this one just feels wayyyy off center. No fun.~GSK23 rated 1/10 on 9 November 2023"," Tormenting in Venice...: If you're looking for a film that's clearly frightening, who's lid is very loose and needs some tightening, where the characters are dull, and the glass is less than full, join Poirot, in this grand faux, that's not enlivening. Although if Kenneth and his acting troupe engaged, gave the impression they weren't in it for the wage, I'd like to think it wouldn't stink, that my eyelids would not sink, into a stupor more akin to older age. Poor old Agatha must be spinning in her grave, it's not just the film that needs a little save, but I guess if you're a fan, can endure what others pan, you'll enjoy performances - that disengage.~Xstal rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"

I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.~The_DATo rated 10/10 on 24 May 2022"," Silent Thrills: The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.~billygoat1071 rated 8/10 on 25 March 2012"," I'm shocked! I loved it!: First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancÃ© and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.8/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 8/10 on 22 April 2012"," Well, it's no Battle Royale...: There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.~wandereramor rated 6/10 on 23 May 2012"," Not quite the Battle Royale: Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.~hani_78696 rated 7/10 on 8 October 2012"," How can this be a cult movie?: OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...~aryassen rated 3/10 on 23 March 2012"," Modern Classic: ""The Hunger Games"" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like ""Bullett"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""Westworld"" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe ""The Hunger Games"" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig's mouth), ""The Running Man"" (More on this later), ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), ""The Lottery"" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in ""The Hunger Games"", since with the exception of the overall winner, ""Winning"" the lottery is a negative,""Total Drama Island"" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, ""Survivor"", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens ""I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks ""History of The World Part I"")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: "" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The ""Karate Kid"" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of ""The Hunger Games"" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when ""Judges"" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: ""My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you."" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):"" There are lots of underdogs in this world,"" he snaps, ""if you could really see them, you would not root for them either."" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""The Running Man."" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the ""Love Sign"", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars.~davidjanuzbrown rated 10/10 on 20 August 2012"," Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!: Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In ""The Hunger Games"", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of ""The Hunger Games"" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next ""Twilight"" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least ""Battle Royale"" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in ""The Hunger Games"" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of clichÃ© cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see ""The Hunger Games"". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, ""The Hunger Games"" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10~GirishGowda rated 3/10 on 26 March 2012"," Spoilers! But don't worry, it's already predictable and weak.: The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. ""Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!"" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll.~groovieknave-177-74234 rated 1/10 on 27 March 2012"," Battle Royale with cheese: In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.~jackharding89-1 rated 3/10 on 9 April 2012"

We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting. Not terrible, but not elevating me either....Something else DID disappoint me more though...More bad: I was waiting for SOME surprising and original twist or plot turn, that would make this story stand out from any other crime movie, which unfortunately never came. Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best. Still worth a watch though, but I only would dare recommmend this to the arthouse movie fans of this killer crime genre.~imseeg rated 7/10 on 31 October 2023"," Great looking, but dull as dishwater.: What happens when a hired killer makes a mistake?After a twenty minute introduction, something finally happens, and you're left with a film that's beautifully shot, well acted, with a somewhat interesting story.The trouble is, if this film were a song, it would be something by The Smiths, there's definitely a fan base, but for some of us, it's all just too slow, too dull, and ultimately a depressing affair.The voiceovers become a little irritating after an hour or so, and that constant first person narration slows the film down to a snail's pace.Neo noir style, nice to look at, and I did like Michael Fassbinder's performance, but ultimately I couldn't stop myself from yawning for the full two hours.5/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 5/10 on 12 November 2023"," Plot-Lovers Will Need To Look Elsewhere: I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. I consider Zodiac, The Social Network, & Fight Club to be amongst my favorite films, and Mindhunter in that same category for TV shows. So, even with The Killer dropping on Netflix, I went to a special theater showing to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way in to this one--mainly because plot-lovers (like me) will largely be a bit lost.For a very basic overview, ""The Killer"" tells the story of the unnamed Killer (Michael Fassbender) hired to perform a rather tedious assassination. When the plan goes a bit awry, however, he must compromise--or at least re-evaluate--some of his principles as he ventures into uncharted emotional territory.The Killer is certainly a clinic in cinematography and choreography, as is the usual Fincher style. Its action set pieces are tension-filled and Fassbender's flat aesthetic is perfect for the lead role. Half the film's dialogue is the Killer's snarky inner monologue, and again Fassbender nails that.The big problem--at least for plot-lovers--here is that there is seemingly very little context or rhyme/reason for what we see transpire. Almost nothing is provided other than what is literally playing out in front of viewers in any given scene. As such, I really struggled to care about anything that was happening--in large part because it quite frankly felt like a series of disconnected interludes as opposed to a whole, coherent story. There were times I even felt bored watching because I knew an extended espionage scene was upcoming and I didn't fully understand the stakes.Seeing as how The Killer is getting relatively high marks, I can assume either one of two things is happening: 1. Audiences are not as hung-up on the lack of discernible plot/motives than I; or 2. There is a deeper message here that I'm just utterly missing. Perhaps the ongoing monologue holds the key--but again, I found that more snarky/sardonic than informative.Perhaps more analysis or a second viewing will crystalize The Killer for me--but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of my first viewing I have to place it near (perhaps at) the bottom of the Fincher canon.~zkonedog rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," Average: Was really looking forward to this movie as i like Michael Fassbender and David Fincher and they never showed it at any cinemas near me during its limited release. Maybe i've just built it up too much in my head but i can't help but be disappointed in it.It has alot of cool style and it as dark as you'd expect from Fincher. Who as you'd imagine, does a good job of directing. But its a very straightforward story and i couldn't help but say ""Would a professional hitman really do that?"" at certain points of it.The constant commentary of the movie won't be for everyone and there's only so much dramatic acting Fassbender can do as a stealthy killer. So all in all. Pretty average.~martinrobertson300482 rated 5/10 on 10 November 2023"," ""If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you."": That's a quote from the opening scene of the movie. I'll give them credit for telling you upfront: you are in for an absolute slog of a movie. It's not hyperbole for me to tell you this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was extremely difficult to get through. I thought about quitting multiple times.To make it worse, the story is ultra basic and fully bland. There is zero intrigue. It failed at making me care about anything or anyone in the movie. There is one really cool fight scene that lasts a couple minutes. Other than that, nothing about this movie stands out.The quality level of filmmaking is far from terrible. But it's swept aside by the sheer boredom that is this movie. I really wish Netflix could figure out how to make movies. I feel like it has to be the writing. Or maybe they just take on scripts that aren't worth making. Way to waste Fassbender.~FeastMode rated 2/10 on 11 November 2023"," Boring movie that's more style over substance: I'm surprised by all the positive reviews here. If you like movies that are stylistic and pretty in theory, but boring and consulates in practice, I guess you'll like this movie. But if you're someone who actually cares about plot, I'd definitely pass.For starters, this movie takes forever to get to the point. It starts off with narration that just continues and continues. If you make it past the dull start, you'll discover an unoriginal plot that's just not interesting enough to justify its unnecessary complexity. There are a few stand out moments, but they're strung together poorly. There's also nothing to get you invested in the characters or their well-being. You're just watching a guy do stuff, and sometimes it's interesting, but a lot of the times it's not.~aprilsfriendorin rated 3/10 on 31 October 2023"," Incredibly slow, predictable and nothing out of the ordinary.: 3.5 â­I love Finchers work but this one was a bit off. This film had a typical revenge story with a lackluster ending. Fassbender lead the way only to discover the script limited his potential for a great performance. The whole film was just sitting and waiting for the peak to hit but it never does.Cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. Production was decent but it didnt seem difficult at all given how the film played out. Dont think any awards will be dished out for this one..A watch and forget movie with no lasting impressions from the audience. Probably why Fincher chose Netflix. Its free to watch for a script he pulled from the middle rack.I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone trying to save 2 hours of their night.~jon_hsieh rated 3/10 on 10 November 2023"," It's...fine?: It's well compiled. The narration got me invested. Shot beautifully, the suspenseful music is excellent. The movie as a whole is...yeah it's fine? It lacks depth and some scenes lack logic as well. It makes for a fun watch nevertheless. Better than most of the stuff going around these days. A one time watch and you never think about it again kind of a watch. Not Fincher's best but not his worst either. Fassbender is decent in his role portrayed as a mysterious killer who has a knack for everything pretty much. Solid punches to the face by a guy twice his size does not faze him at all. That's about it really.~SneakyWasabi rated 6/10 on 10 November 2023"," Yeah, nah.: The Killer simply gives you no reason to be invested in it, rather empty, uneventful and dull for the runtime.It's nothing you haven't seen before either and without substance, considering those involved, though not awful or anything. The soundtrack however is awful, given it isn't satire like ""American Psycho."" The fight scene's like a video game, skill and cunning's hardly overcoming that sort of velocity of power. Take the UFC battle between Frank Mir and Brock Lesnar as a basic example. I mean the sequence's probably still the highlight of the film, I just didn't buy it. All up a pretty pointless film.~bombersflyup rated 3/10 on 11 November 2023"," Empathy is Weakness: The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is a paid assassin. In Paris he misses his mark (Endre Hules) and kills a dominatrix (Monique Ganderton) instead. He now becomes a mark himself. He arrives late at home to discover his girlfriend in a hospital. He goes on a revenge tour.The film consists of Fassbender talking in a monotone in his head. It is boring as he keeps giving himself the same rules and affirmations over and over. There is an element of humor in his various alias based on fictional characters in 1970's TV shows. I caught, Felix Unger, Oscar Madison, Howard Cunningham, Reuben Kincaid, Sam Malone, George Jefferson, Lou Grant, and Robert Hartley (Bob Newhart Show).

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) - IMDb,7.7,Tom Cruise|Hayley Atwell|Ving Rhames|Simon Pegg|Rebecca Ferguson|Vanessa Kirby|Esai Morales|Pom Klementieff|Henry Czerny|Shea Whigham|Greg Tarzan Davis|Frederick Schmidt|Mariela Garriga|Cary Elwes|Charles Parnell|Mark Gatiss|Indira Varma|Rob Delaney,Christopher McQuarrie,Bruce Geller|Christopher McQuarrie|Erik Jendresen,Ethan Hunt and his IMF team must track down a dangerous weapon before it falls into the wrong hands.," Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Part One) boasts some of cinema's most stunning stunt work, but it came at the cost of character development and a solid story.: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.~Paragon240 rated 7/10 on 12 July 2023"," A Mindless Scour to the Series: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.~JackRJosie rated 6/10 on 15 July 2023"," Your high expectations will get a beating...: 4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 5/10 on 12 July 2023"," Very disappointing: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.~ragingbull_2005 rated 5/10 on 18 July 2023"," Tom Cruise just gets it...: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!~jackreinbott rated 9/10 on 8 July 2023"," Best franchise currently going: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.~masonsaul rated 10/10 on 10 July 2023"," Tom still The King: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.~MFC9 rated 9/10 on 8 July 2023"," Dead stupid.: Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.~BA_Harrison rated 5/10 on 11 July 2023"," One clever action sequence - after two and a half hours - does not make a good movie.: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.~210west rated 4/10 on 18 July 2023"," I think Tom Cruse may have single handily saved movie theatres.: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

Beautiful cinematography. Great score.~andrewchristianjr rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," Not For Everyone: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.~slightlymad22 rated 8/10 on 4 March 2022"," Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.: A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 18 December 2022"," Everything I wanted and more: I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.~jtindahouse rated 10/10 on 2 March 2022"," Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.~TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews rated 9/10 on 5 March 2022"," The Batman Is A Hell Of A Movie: Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.~HabibieHakim123 rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," The try-hard Batman movie: Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!~whatgift rated 5/10 on 7 March 2022"," Overblown, overhyped latest addition to the Batman franchise: STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **~wellthatswhatithinkanyway rated 4/10 on 4 April 2022"," Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.: I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.~jegd-847-631407 rated 4/10 on 5 March 2022"," A good Batman movie: The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Beautiful cinematography. Great score.~andrewchristianjr rated 9/10 on 2 March 2022"," Not For Everyone: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.~slightlymad22 rated 8/10 on 4 March 2022"," Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.: A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 18 December 2022"," Everything I wanted and more: I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.~jtindahouse rated 10/10 on 2 March 2022"," Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language.

The first half of the movie is about the process of belonging. Any guy who ever wanted, craved, hoped to belong to a gang of guys-who they deem tougher, wiser, stronger-will identify. Don't wait for explosions, don't wait for cheap thrills. Enjoy the process. Get dirty with the fishermen. That's what the movie captures very well. The second half is about nerves.

But as magnificent the performance of mister Tommy Lee Jones may be, actor Ben Foster just didnt cut it in the dramatic scenes, in which he (and all the other actors for that matter) failed to deliver true drama.True drama needs credible acting performances from ALL the actors concerned. Now we have only Tommy Lee Jones performance to deliver true drama, but his role (however important) was of a supporting nature, which makes us viewers have to deal with other leading actors who fail to impress.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 16 December 2023"," A slow burner for sure, but gradually becomes an incredible emotional ride: This is a very good picture, one that has quickly become one of my favorite this year. It is not an action movie, far from it, and not a crime story either. It is all about human emotions, and how we deal with them. Don't make me wrong: it is quite slow in development (of the story), but grows and grows, and gradually grows on you. By the time it ends, you feel emotionally lifted. All the attributes of a good movie are there: the production value is first class, the acting is impeccable as so is the direction, with the editing and the score not far behind. If you liked 'Fathers and Daughters' (2015), this project is definitely for you.~attilalengyel-78684 rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Watchable.: This gritty thriller has a Dennis Lehane feel for the blue collar working classes on the North East Atlantic side of the US, in this case a group of fisherman tied up with a drug plot to get money.It's a film of two halves and goes in a direction I didn't anticipate: at first I thought it a family disaster movie et al A Perfect Storm then goes into another territory of drug running.It's all very watchable and the cast are well picked, they all look weatherbeaten and belong at sea.The scripting is a little lazy: surely a small community would react to grizzled old Tommy Lee Jones shooting and killing three drug dealers in a donut store and report it to his ex wife and her new husband before their son shows up and if so surely they would mention it. It's HUGE news in a quiet fishing community!And no mention of Jenna Ortegas beaten up face at the family dinner?If I were the mother I would put two and two together...Also the father wanting in on the fishing business as a partner, seemed too neat and tidy at the end ;especially when he was so against it in the beginning and Charlie being so involved.~dweston-38669 rated NA on 16 December 2023"," OMG this was painful: I don't know here to begin. First, it was so slow. The music was ripped from a Hallmark TV movie and so on the nose of how you should feel. It was just too distracting. Tommy Lee was useless in this. The acting for the most part was terrible, but especially from Jenny Ortega.And then the writing was just so bad. Like the ""dad"" coming into the bar in the beginning and caused a scene, which just would never happen.The movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It was all over the place with too many ideas and not enough focus. 45 minutes into it and nothing has really happened, except the superfluous rushed relationship between Mabel and Charlie.I just don't see why this was even made. What was the point of it? If you want to make a movie have something NEW to say., like a message, maybe just pure entertainment, but then it should be funny. This was nothing new. It reminded me of the Perfect Storm, kinda.Everyone seemed unlikable and uninteresting. Over an hour into it and I'm bored to death!!~MovieCriticOnline rated 1/10 on 21 December 2023"," Disappointingly superficial, clichÃ©d macho-drama guff: In sub-standard macho-drama ""Finestkind"" Toby Wallace joins older half-brother Ben Foster's self-satisfied ruffty-tuffty crew of US East Coast fishermen (including Ismael Cruz Cordova (decent)) whose troubles at sea spiral exponentially when they try smuggling heroin for the mob (led by Clayne Crawford). Experienced writer / director Brian Helgeland messed up badly with this superficial, short-cutting, clichÃ©d guff that doesn't seem to know what kinda film it wants to be - especially considering the talented cast he had for it, that also included Jenna Ortega (rising superstar - with good reason), Tommy Lee Jones & Lolita Davidovitch. Major disappointment. A turd. Flush it.~danieljfarthing rated 4/10 on 19 December 2023"," Pretty good film, IMO: The reviewers that downrated this film are entitled to their opinions, but so am I. My opinion is that this is a good story, and it was told without leaning on overstated action scenes and unbelievable violence. There were a few goofs here and there, but nothing that made me dislike the overall story or the screenplay itself.This is a story of two brothers who were brought up apart from each other but who came back together because the younger brother wanted to see how his older brother managed a life that was a world away from the one that the younger one felt he was being led into by his father. Charley was the younger one, a half- brother to Tom, the older one. Tom was a fishing boat captain while Charley was headed to law school, following his father, a successful lawyer. Charley wanted to see what fishing boats were like, so he asked Tom to hire him as a deckhand.Tom's boat sank on their first trip together, and Tom suspected that the owner of the fleet of boats that included the one Tom commanded had not kept the boat properly maintained. That led Tom to confront the owner, an arrogant young non-fisherman and the confrontation left Tom unemployed.Tom's father, Ray ( played by Tommy Lee Jones) asked Tom to captain the ""Finestkind"", Ray's scallop dredger. Tom agreed, but disregarded Ray's order to fish according to Ray's plan, and took the boat into Canadian waters. The Canadian Coast Guard caught Tom in the act of poaching scallops in Canadian waters, which led to the boat and the catch being impounded. The catch was seized and the boat was held for a $100,000 fine that would have to be paid before the boat would be returned to Ray.This leads to the real drama of the story. You'll want to watch what happens. The story shows how important family ties are. There is some violence, but it is by no means a violent crime drama. Maybe that is what makes some people dislike the film, but it was a pleasant change for me given the violent action films that are so prevalent today.~silverton-37959 rated 7/10 on 24 December 2023"," Is this a joke?: 1) When the boat explodes, the captain's Mayday reports his position as 69 degrees west. When the coast guard helicopter locates the life raft, USCG report its location as 42 degrees east, 65 degrees west. Are you kidding me? They give two incorrect longitudinal positions and no latitude? Longitude at 40 miles SE of New Bedford is about 70 degrees west. The life raft would've had to drift about 300 miles, almost an impossibility, to reach 65 degrees.2) While being rescued, they act like drunks at a frat party.3) Once aboard the helicopter, they continue laughing hysterically for no reason.4) After losing their boat and nearly their lives, the brothers seem unconcerned about the boat and the huge financial difficulties that await them. Instead, they head directly to a bar for drinks the same morning as the rescue. Never mind that their mother might be worried. One brother finally calls the mother after he is served a boilermaker.This all occurs in the first nine minutes of the film. Tommy Lee's character hadn't even been introduced yet. I couldn't watch another moment of this trash.~rdhoran rated 1/10 on 16 December 2023"
