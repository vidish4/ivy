Anyone But You (2023) - IMDb,6.6,Sydney Sweeney|Glen Powell|Alexandra Shipp|Mia Artemis|Nat Buchanan|Josh Bonello|Gata|Hadley Robinson|Dermot Mulroney|Rachel Griffiths|Deborah Faye Lee|Lance Kerfuffle|Taryn Gluck|Alexandra Gluck|Summer Tian|Dan Liu|Davina Chan Gallagher|Charlee Fraser,Will Gluck,Ilana Wolpert|Will Gluck,"After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold--until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia. So they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple."," It's exactly what you expect: This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better.~miza004 rated 5/10 on 22 December 2023"," Forgettable rom-com that fails to spark and lacks romantic chemistry, hindered by bland acting from Sydney Sweeney and rushed, empty character development: A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time.~ambusched94 rated 2/10 on 31 December 2023"," How?: I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs.~Remmuchan rated 3/10 on 27 December 2023"," Bad Movie: Rating: 4.4Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable.~cinemapersonified rated 4/10 on 22 December 2023"," Pure escapism featuring beautiful people, beautiful locations with lots of laugh out loud moments: This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this.~MichaelByTheSea rated 9/10 on 26 December 2023"," Cringe, boring comedy with paper thin romance. If this is what is called romantic and funny nowadays, then love and comedy are dead!: I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and taken seriously.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!~NatKaminska rated 1/10 on 28 December 2023"," People got paid for this??: Horrible horrible film. My wife enjoys the classic rom coms and we enjoy modern ones when they understand how to make it fun, cheesy and pleasant to watch. This movie had NONE of those things. The acting was like watching a bad high school play. Zero chemistry between any of the actors/characters. The script itself was awful and it was ZERO fun to watch. I just wanted it to be over and would have loved to walk out of the theatre before it was over. Just save your money and stay away. There is also random gross nudity. If you want to see a man hold his penis to the camera then wat ch this crap.~matthew-734-594954 rated 1/10 on 22 December 2023"," Embarrassingly bad.: As I watched, I began to wonder if Sydney Sweeney was the producer's girlfriend. How did she get cast in this lead?! She was terrible. And there is no chemistry between Glen Powell and Sweeney. I know she has some other credits but HOW did she get this film?In every single scene, she is wearing revealing clothing. See-thru fabric or clingy fabric, and the tiniest bikinis or thongs. And sometimes she is just naked. She has a great body but she is trying sooooo hard to show it off that you begin to feel embarrassed for the actress. But that's when I began to suspect that perhaps SHE was the producer. I've seen it before where an actress self-produces a film, casting herself in a sexy leading role opposite a hot guy. In this case, she is opposite two hot guys who both desire her. We've all seen women who try hard to be sexy. The harder they try, the bigger they fail. There is nothing as UNsexy as a person TRYING to be sexy. And that is Sydney Sweeney throughout this film.Glen Powell needs to be more selective in his role choices. He does the best he could with a bad script and awful leading lady. But he should have pushed back at some of the lousy direction.Powell played a character. Sweeney played a caricature.A particularly stupid scene is on a cliff where Powell and Sweeney are trying to convince the group (standing behind them) that they are lovers. Powell ""awkwardly"" tries to put his hand ""awkwardly"" on Sweeney's ass. But he ""awkwardly"" doesn't know what to do with his hand. So he ""awkwardly"" ends up almost playing bongos on her butt. It gets even worse when he ""awkwardly"" struggles to get his hand down inside her tight shorts and he....you guessed it....""awkwardly"" can't figure out where to rest his hand once inside her shorts. And, as you can imagine in this mess, then it is Sweeney's turn to do the same thing to his ass. They tried so hard to ""play awkward"" that it never worked. Unbelievable and embarrassingly stupid. You have to blame the writers, then the director, then the actress who was self-producing this dreck. But I also blame Powell. He should have trusted his instincts and known this would come off bad. He should have refused this hideous ""bit"". It doesn't make the audience laugh. The scene goes from eye-roll to cringe fest.And then it went from bad to worse when he chucked off his clothes and she examined him for spiders. Could have been a funny bit but once again, they leaned in too hard and beat the joke to death.Poor writing with adolescent dialogue throughout. When you can't write, you throw in crude language. It doesn't make it ""real"", it makes it lame. Perhaps they felt the Gen Z'ers would relate to using cuss words in every single sentence. But it just made every character seem uneducated and stupid. Someone gift those writers with a thesaurus.The rest of the cast was wasted in such a poorly constructed film. I hope they enjoyed their trip to Australia and the paychecks because that is all they are taking away from this experience.I was looking forward to this film. Such a disappointment. But the dog was good.Oh, and yeah, Sydney Sweeney IS the producer.~alwaysfuelingthefire rated 3/10 on 25 December 2023"," Cute couple moments, but background characters and story fell short: We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school.~alyetc rated 5/10 on 28 December 2023"," Cute movie: Movie was cute, but not one of Glen Powell's finest roles. He is worthy of better casting. The movie relies heavily on using the word f""""k which didn't work to make the movie funny. They also tried to use nudity to make you laugh. IMO if you have to curse and be naked to make someone laugh, you have a poor director. Also, Sydney Sweeney's voice just sounded off on screen. I don't know if she always sounds nasal, or if it was just in this movie. The plot was cute, but the characters needed enhancing. All in all, this is one to watch at home on one of the streaming services instead of spending the money on movie tickets.~bczzkjgd rated 5/10 on 31 December 2023"

Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.~UniqueParticle rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!: Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.~nicolasroop rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," Poor Things Emma Stone's Mesmerizing Resurrection: ""Poor Things"" is a spellbinding tale that catapults the audience into the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist, Dr. Godwin Baxter.

This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.~Lepidopterous_ rated 9/10 on 8 December 2023"," A Film not a movie, powerful, discomforting, unique, splendidly difficult and high craft throughout: This is not a film for the faint of heart nor the prudish. A bold film recalling us with consuming set designs, subtle changes in bold costuming across scenes, a cinematic score, surrealistic elements in London, magical realism in Lisbon, philophical noir on a ship and harsh yet poetic reality in Paris. Emma Stone is brilliant throwing herself into this role with studied abandon. Defoe and Ruffalo are strong.This is at root a film about femine spirit freed of societies embedding of politeness, being proper and pretty. How might it be if we shook the tree by getting out of woman's way? Caring or cruel?If you love film, this is must view art. If a movie goer seeking traditional plot lines, clean character arcs and familiar tropes; wait until you can stream this at home. Thus you can turn it off 30 minutes in and review the film here. Enjoy.~jtscheduling rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Poor Things is defiantly original, both visually striking and though provoking in equal measure - a true cinematic masterpiece: ""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!~laurenspierre rated 10/10 on 19 October 2023", Unforgivingly Bizarre and chaotic but endearing: The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates.~Camerenth rated 9/10 on 15 December 2023," A Bizarre Masterpiece: If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.~aciessi rated 9/10 on 24 December 2023"," Lanthimos at his most charming: Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.~drownsoda90 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," ""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling: I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.~cutie7 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"
Maestro (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Carey Mulligan|Bradley Cooper|Matt Bomer|Vincenzo Amato|Greg Hildreth|Michael Urie|Brian Klugman|Nick Blaemire|Mallory Portnoy|Alexandra Santini|Jarrod LaBine|Sarah Silverman|Kate Eastman|William Hill|Valéry Lessard|Renée Stork|Tim Rogan|Sara Sanderson,Bradley Cooper,Bradley Cooper|Josh Singer,This love story chronicles the lifelong relationship of conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.," Beautiful to look at, gorgeous music, but no story.: I went to Maestro expecting a film that would chronicle the life of one of America's, if not the world's, great composer/conductors. I've seen Leonard Bernstein many, many times, starting at age 8 when my grandfather took me to Bernstein's music for kids on Saturday mornings at Lincoln Center. I had no idea who he was at the time, only that people called him Lenny. My grandpa took me to meet him and he was spellbinding. I remember him looking right threw me with his expressive eyes.He loved kids and loved to teach them about music. Turns out grandpa and Lenny went to Harvard together, hence I got a personal introduction. Bernstein is the guy that got me hooked on classical music and music in general, but I didn't learn anything about his musical career, his childhood, his years at Harvard, his work in Europe, who inspired him, etc.The making of West Side Story is really interesting (if you know the story) but nothing about it in this film and I mean ""nothing.; We get a tiny glimpse of Candide, but nothing about its composition or insight into the Maestro's process. We get zero insight into his Missa Brevis, perhaps on the highlights of his career.Bradley Cooper blew me away. I've seen Lenny up close many times and I've talked to him a few times. Cooper nailed it, and the scene at St John of the Divine is probably one of the greatest musical scenes ever captured on film. Cooper's conducting is simply amazing. He worked very very hard to capture the speech, mannerisms, and the Bernstein attitude and texture toward music. I cannot speak highly enough of Cooper's performance, but we get so little insight into the musician, and that was so disappointing.Carey Mulligan? Her performance is nothing less than spectacular, in fact all the acting is extraordinary, but it's not a story. The Bernstein children really have nothing to do in this film, and I have no idea why Lenny's sister was included as she has very little to say or do. Overall, a very perplexing film ... not sure what he was going for. In fact, I kept waiting for it to start. The emphasis was all on style, and believe me, it's beautiful to look at.~rich-fouts rated 6/10 on 14 December 2023"," Showcases Everything Least Interesting About Bernstein's Life: When Amy Schumer was roasting the film ""Being the Ricardos"" at the Oscars a couple of years ago, she was making fun of Aaron Sorkin for writing a screenplay about the most iconic female comedian of all time that didn't have a single funny moment. She compared it to making a biopic about Michael Jordan and only showing the bus trips between games.Bradley Cooper, pay attention. Why did you choose to make a movie about Leonard Bernstein, arguably one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century, and then focus on all of the most mundane aspects of his life? Do we need yet another movie about a famous person bogged down with scene after scene of them squabbling with their spouse? If you don't already know why Bernstein is so legendary, you're not going to learn it here. You might not even come away from the movie knowing what Bernstein wrote, because the film tosses out titles quickly and casually as it's rushing to get to the next scene of Cooper overacting and Carey Mulligan looking strained as all long-suffering wives in all biopics ever made must do. You don't see him developing any projects or working with collaborators. The movie implies that he was disdainful of his success in musical theater despite revolutionizing it with ""West Side Story."" But then why did he spend so much time working in it if he hated it? Why weren't we at least treated with someone doing a cameo appearance as Stephen Sondheim? Why why why?And then to top it all off, the last quarter of the film is a dreary slog as we watch Mulligan slowly die of cancer. I despise it when movies show characters slowly dying of cancer. It freaks me out, and I hate it. I know this woman actually did die of cancer, but I don't want to watch it. That's more my problem than it is the movie's, because that's what happened, but still.Cooper's screenplay is terrible, and because of that, nothing else about the movie has a chance. Mulligan is quite good, but she's hampered by the material. Cooper will be nominated for an Oscar, and might win, because the Academy loves nothing more than rewarding actors for playing famous people while heaped under prosthetic makeup. To the film's credit, for once the makeup is quite good. Usually biopic makeup makes the actors look like their faces are about to melt off, but here the effect is pretty seamless.Someone clearly told Bradley Cooper that Warren Beatty is the only person to ever score Oscar nominations for producing, directing, writing, and acting in the same film, and Cooper said ""Hold my beer."" He's so desperately hankering for an Oscar for this film that you can smell red carpet wafting from the screen.Grade: C-~evanston_dad rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Mesmirising portrait, but not in the way I had expected...: Beware, this is a movie about Bernstein's marriage, NOT about his music. It should have better been titled as ""The Marriage of Leonard & Felicia"" and not ""Maestro"".I expected a music biopic, but what I got was a masterfully directed and terrifically acted portrait of a marriage with a bisexual husband and all the difficulties (secret affairs with gay men) that came along with it, when back in the days of the fifties and sixties, being gay wasnt something one could openly talk about in public.The good: LONG scenes with NO editing cuts. What BLISS to be able to watch these 2 great actors perform uninhibited by cuts, with many minutes long lasting scenes filmed from 1 static angle. I truly applaud the director (Bradley Cooper) and the photographer and editor for this gorgeous and balanced way of filming this portrait. I was really impressed!Any bad? I had my trepidations about Bradley Cooper's impersonation of Bernstein that was borderline according to many. Did he pull it off? I think he did a really good job, although it took me some time to get used to all the mannerisims (the peculiar voice in particular). I can understand though that others might get a bit uneasy / irritated by some of the makeup (too much?) and other mannerisims.Carey Mulligan (as the wife of Bernstein) deserves special mention. Her role was more subdued and subtle, but AS powerful and touching. She truly shined!Conclusion: I am not a fan of watching stories about artist's private lives, but as far as this personal account of Leonard Bernstein's marriage is concerned, they created a really mesmirising, warmhearted portrait, that left me behind in my seat with goosebumps and in reverence...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb!~imseeg rated 8/10 on 26 November 2023"," Admired it more than I liked it: POSITIVES:1) The two central performances are both absolutely sensational. Both Cooper and Mulligan have some really jaw dropping scenes and they were what kept me engaged throughout2) The direction and cinematography are both superb. There are lots of long takes and clever camerawork and this helped to make certain scenes feel much more impactful, such as the big conducting scene near the end that goes on for several minutes with only a couple of cuts3) Using Bernstein's own pieces as the score for the film was very clever and I loved how over dramatic the score felt a lot of the timeNEGATIVES:1) I really didn't like the first hour or so of this film while it was in black and white. It just felt so pretentious, fake and full of itself. Also, the characters all talk insanely fast for some reason during the black and white scenes. Things did improve once things went to colour though2) As the title of this review states, I felt like the film was more of a technical achievement than something I actually enjoyed watching. I didn't really care about any of the characters, in fact I found Bernstein very unlikeable, and I wasn't really invested in the plot3) As is the case with a lot of biopics, I think this film is guilty of trying to cram an entire person's life into only 2 hours, which makes a lot of things feel very rushed.~DanLawson146 rated 7/10 on 7 December 2023"," Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance: It's a biopic set in New York City between 1943 and the late 1980s. Its primary focus is the relationship and marriage between Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). We learn pretty early that Bernstein's sexual appetites extend to both women and men. An early male relationship is with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). Felicia knows Bernstein's orientation from the beginning but asks that he be discrete. We also meet Bernstein's sister, Shirley (Sarah Silverman), and, especially, he and Felicia's oldest daughter, Jamie (Maya Hawke).The second orientation of ""Maestro"" is Bernstein's difficulty harnessing his expansive skills in composition, conducting, and popular education about music. His extroversion sometimes hinders his ability to focus. The film portrays this issue less effectively.""Maestro"" is an intense and skillfully photographed movie. The cinematography reflects the era being portrayed. Thus, for example, the film is black and white until the 1960s. I cannot comment on the portrayals of Bernstein's conducting or the quality of his compositions, except to note that Bernstein's conducting is very intense. An enormous number of people populate the film, making it difficult to keep track from time to time. That said, Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance that deserves Academy consideration, though some parts of her life are missing, such as her political activism.Cooper's Bernstein is not deep outside the relationship with Felicia that slowly deteriorates. The film omits to mention that Bernstein also had affairs with women during the marriage. The movie portrays Felicia's final illness with breast cancer very effectively and emotionally..~steiner-sam rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," I've watched too many of this kind of story, and 'Maestro' isn't an inch different.: A struggling musician agonized by his own genius, talents, and creativity and trapped in loveless marriage filled with guilt. Both look the other way while one has an affair and realize the importance of one's own partner too late. Right now, at the top of my head I can think of 'Fosse/Verdon', 'A Star Is Born', 'George & Tammy', 'Walk the Line', 'Dreamgirls', 'Daisy Jones & The Six', and etc. (Wow, that's a lot.) Biographical genre is especially tricky because it has to excel the life of actual historical figures. 'Maestro' could have been so much better if it delved into the introspective and artistic side of Bernstein deeper or provided a different and fresh point of view on his life rather than reciting his personal life. His autobiography or research would be more fun and interesting than this explanatory movie.There were a few futile attempts to make the movie look more artistic, abstract, and ambiguous. They failed because they serve no purpose but to look pretentious. White and black, camera movement, the use of light and shadows, and musical aspects. They are all good attempts, but for what? By doing so, is the story getting stronger? Do they enhance what viewers feel? Waste of time and films.Bradley Cooper's performance is disappointing. He never acts; he imitates. When he's on the screen, we know clearly that he's acting. It's hard to be absorbed and immersed into the screen because he always pushes the audience away with his trying too hard. I get that he wants to emulate Bernstein's twangy voice. However, emotions and messages he delivers are more important than his likeness of Bernstein's tone, accent, sound, or mannerism. He focuses on what's outside of Bernstein rather than what would be inside of him. There is a 10 minute sequence of Cooper conducting, and it's screaming 'Look how good I am!!!'. It's one of the highest points for emotions to burst out for the audience, and I started to laugh.~TaylorYee94 rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," The filmmaking was very good, but I found the story not that interesting.: We don't know much about Leonard Bernstein. We didn't learn why he wanted to be a composer or how he got in the business. His relationship wasn't very clear either. He's bisexual, but that doesn't go anywhere. His wife isn't explained much either other than being a stage actress. We don't know much about his children. The timelines aren't clear when the movie takes place. It seems to start in the 50s other than the opening scene of him as an old man. I do like Bradley Cooper's performance, but not much comes from the character. We don't know what made him famous since he was already famous before his memorable score in On the Waterfront.~MJB784 rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," Where's the biography?: Yes, good acting, great music but absolutely no story. At all. Apart from his bisexuality which dominated the script.Bradley Cooper was too greedy in writing, directing and starring. What did he write? Not much of a story. I'd like to have seen Lenny's childhood explicated, more meat on the bare bones offered here.Also, why so little on West Side Story - one brief extract and not the huge explosive hit it was at the time. The adulation which followed.The teasing bits of his Missa were beautiful and far too much of his Mahler, though lovely, had little bearing on the overall story.Brad's prosthetic nose was distracting in that it gave a nasal whiny tone to his dialogue. And he might have done better with another actor.Carey Mulligan, as always was amazing in her role but again, underplayed the distress she must have felt at his infidelity/. At one point he left her for a young (male) lover and only returned when she was diagnosed with cancer. (in her breast, from a broken heart? Who knows)The great man of music was not served well here, far too shallow a treatment of his genius.5/10.~wisewebwoman rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," How is it possbile to make Leonard Bernstein uninteresting?: The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper's transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn't a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife's dealing with her husband's bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein's conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn't much left!~fmdead rated 6/10 on 24 December 2023", Too much about his marriage: Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception. Bradley should just have acted and not tried to direct and write the screenplay.~phd_travel rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023

It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. Best Performance: Bill Nighy~lesleyharris30 rated 10/10 on 1 January 2016"," Surprisingly Enjoyable: I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.~milareppa rated 9/10 on 6 April 2004"," A deeply loving film rich in character: It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)~bzb2001 rated 10/10 on 28 November 2004"," Delightfull Homage to Love: In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love.

""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Simplesmente Amor"" (""Simply Love"")~claudio_carvalho rated 9/10 on 29 May 2005", You'll actually love 'Love Actually': Love Actually is a romantic comedy film directed by Richard Curtis. The film stars an ensemble cast.The film revolves around eight couples and their tryst with love.A pleasant and heart warming film and the best part of the film is that despite of a huge number of cast every character is been given the equal weightage and importance and it doesn't feels that if any of the story is left incomplete or not been given equal importance.Acting is superb and almost all the characters were chosen wisely and acted perfectly.Screenplay of the film is very simple and straight and probably a little drawback of the film as the film becomes too predictable. The comedy in the film is awesome and keeps your funny bone tickling. The climax of the film is predictable and good.A must watch romantic comedy film and one of the best romantic comedy film.~sauravjoshi85 rated 8/10 on 22 February 2022," A Holiday Fantasy Classic (Yes, Fantasy - Negative Reviewers Get Over It ;-): This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Duplex."" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick ""pick me up"" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.~jackburden rated NA on 19 December 2004"," Unshamedly sentimental, but a very well-done film!: Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film. I was annoyed a bit by Rowan Atkinson, but I really like this. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 13 May 2009"," The Ultimate Romantic Comedy: Served in a British Vein (Trying for Unspoiled, cannot guarantee - Actually!): Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part...Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of the just-widowered Liam Neeson's character by pass Customs to pursue true love of a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-American girl(this was where love did not know Race... Color-Blind), but he did everything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effed up his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrapping sequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque all at the same time w/o conflicting.. Amazing!!)Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous; Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman's wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM who effed up Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bushy"" prez was superb and I liked the girl from EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class! Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually...Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in the weirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, they were sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy's send-up really did do well in the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!~AirBourne_Bds rated 10/10 on 26 August 2004"," Clever and delightful, actually.: This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film.~Turambar-3 rated 8/10 on 19 December 2004"
It's a Wonderful Life (1946) - IMDb,8.6,James Stewart|Donna Reed|Lionel Barrymore|Thomas Mitchell|Henry Travers|Beulah Bondi|Frank Faylen|Ward Bond|Gloria Grahame|H.B. Warner|Frank Albertson|Todd Karns|Samuel S. Hinds|Mary Treen|Virginia Patton|Charles Williams|Sarah Edwards|William Edmunds,Frank Capra,Frances Goodrich|Albert Hackett|Frank Capra,An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.," ""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town"": I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.~bkoganbing rated 10/10 on 25 December 2005"," A Great Influence...: No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...~Coxer99 rated 10/10 on 4 March 1999"," One of those quintessential Christmas movies....: It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 28 March 2010"," A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic: This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.~FlickJunkie-2 rated 10/10 on 6 December 2000"," A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.: This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.~PyrolyticCarbon rated 10/10 on 13 September 2002"," Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.: Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.~Aidan McGuinness rated 9/10 on 11 February 2002"," It's a Wonderful Life: One of the best family movies I have ever seen, the storyline is amazing and puts hope in your heart. When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know. The events of the film were fun. The characters of the film were good. Two characters were prepared, James and Clarence. They were very interesting characters and I really enjoyed watching them. The end of the film is one of the best movie endings in history. I recommend watching it especially the black and white version. The black version is better than the color version.

Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.~dweck rated NA on 9 December 1998"," Who are you, really?: Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience.

I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.~MrDHWong rated 9/10 on 19 October 2023"," Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...: The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !~imseeg rated 5/10 on 21 October 2023"," Could have been told in 2 hours: Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)While watching the Irishman, I remember feeling guilty about pausing to check how much time was left. This time, I was scared to look at the watch because I never leave the cinema without finishing a. Movie. I know it's Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors who made phenomenal movies like Taxi Driver, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed, but honestly, Scorsese shmorsese for making this one 2 hours longer than it had to be.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves. It's a nice story that could have been an 8/10 as it explores the topics of greed, colonisation and cultural erasure without any consequences. It also came out at a perfect time considering the current events, but did it have to be sooooo damn loooong?Knowing the title of the film, you automatically know it's ending so that alone saps out all the mystery. For what is supposed to be a sad story, the film doesn't create any emotional weight to make us care for it's characters and as a result, it's hard to connect with anything. De Niro and Fraser did a fine job but DiCaprio looked like a pitiful aging boar instead of the young, sly and seductive fox he was meant to be.The costumes and decorations were great but it's like they forgot about the audience while making this film. The story repeats the same trope again and again creating zero tension for us to be invested in until the final 30 minutes. Moreover, it's as if the whole cast, was injected with ketamine as they looked and sounded lethargic adding more weight to the dragging pace.If Scorsese wanted to make an impact then he should've used emotions and tension instead of 600 pauses, glances and empty conversations. He was trying to say a lot in the epilogue about tragedy being hidden behind entertainment and profit but by the time the epilogue finally came, I was happy to go home instead of being floored by the sadness. It's an important story that sadly didn't work out as an impactful drama.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.~arabnikita rated 4/10 on 21 October 2023"," Killers Of The Audience's Bladders: Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.~boblipton rated 7/10 on 22 October 2023"," Extremely Long & Incredibly Morose: Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 5/10 on 18 November 2023"," Killers of my patience: Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.~Med-Jasta rated 4/10 on 22 October 2023"," Coyote want money: Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 9/10 on 18 October 2023"," Somewhere in the middle for me: I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.~petervd rated 7/10 on 29 October 2023"," Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese: Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.~fredrikgunerius rated 4/10 on 15 November 2023"," Not the masterpiece that was hyped: Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.~Truedutch rated 7/10 on 19 October 2023"

The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 7/10 on 31 December 2010"," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz: Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.

Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point.

Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human?

Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10~pyrocitor rated 8/10 on 14 December 2015"," There's magic in the man in green.: The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him. At times, this can even bring on a tear of joy.~mark.waltz rated 10/10 on 21 December 2020"," WOW I forgot how great this film was: BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS.

This film is full of ""Christmas Spirit"" that most films never seem to capture. In this film On Christmas Eve in 1973, an orphaned infant boy stows away on Santa Claus' sack. When discovered back at the North Pole, he is adopted by Papa Elf. Papa Elf names his son Buddy.Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to his human size is unable to perform elf tasks. When Buddy accidentally learns that he is human, Papa Elf explains that he was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and was given up for adoption without Walter knowing.

White Christmas (1954) - IMDb,7.6,Bing Crosby|Danny Kaye|Rosemary Clooney|Vera-Ellen|Dean Jagger|Mary Wickes|John Brascia|Anne Whitfield|Bea Allen|Leon Alton|Al Bain|Frank Baker|Benjie Bancroft|Mary Bayless|Joan Bayley|Brandon Beach|Paul Bradley|Tex Brodus,Michael Curtiz,Norman Krasna|Norman Panama|Melvin Frank,A successful song-and-dance team become romantically involved with a sister act and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general.," "".........just like the ones we used to know."": By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derrière and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.~bkoganbing rated 9/10 on 11 August 2005"," Excellent and timeless Christmas holiday movie: I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now. Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 18 November 2009"," Merry Christmas thanks to Irving Berlin: The music of Irving Berlin, one of America's most distinguished composers of the 20th century, is at the center of this pleasant holiday film, that if one is to judge by the comments submitted to this forum, is a perennial favorite of audiences that discover this charming movie, or just go back to visit from time to time.Directed by Michael Curtiz, a versatile man; he was at ease with drama as well as comedy, or musicals. He shows a light touch that helps make this a cherished film for movie fans of all ages. Based on material by another great team, Norman Panama, Norman Krasna and Melvin Frank, the movie is light as a feather. The film is sort of a variation on the theme, ""let's put on a show"", or even, ""if we stage it, they will come"", we know how it will end, but we feel good, and enjoy it even though we know the plot by heart.The main reason for watching, besides Mr. Berlin's wonderful tunes, is hearing those standard songs delivered by the likes of Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, who were at the top of their careers. They had such wonderful and melodious voices, they enhance the songs they interpret. The story is just a pretext to bring together the talented principals plus Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen, Dean Jagger, and the marvelous Mary Wickes, in a film that will delight anyone, anytime, but especially at Christmas.~jotix100 rated 7/10 on 18 January 2008"," Sometimes the audience knows better than the critics!: Over the years, I've read a number of professional critics' reviews of this film; almost all were mildly to severely negative.  And here's the interesting thing: I don't disagree with most of the individual carps. Yes, the movie is a piece of fluff. Yes,the usually dependable Danny Kaye is a bit weak in his performance. Yes, the plot mechanism for inserting many of the production numbers is lame.  Heck, even the continuity is poor...I myself have discovered three noticeable continuity fluffs. But here's the thing.  The movie works, anyway!!! Bing and Danny nevertheless make a likeable ""Mutt and Jeff"" duo. The supporting cast all holds their own, from a radiant (and surprisingly voluptuous) Rosemary Clooney, to the astoundingly agile Vera Ellen, to Dean Jagger's Patton-like General Waverly...they all hit their marks very well. The plot-line is unbelievable.  Who cares?  This is a feel-good Christmas Movie, for cryin' out loud!  The production numbers are sheer fun, the plot doesn't get in the way of all the beauty and great music, the actors are obviously having a good time, and we're all allowed to window-peep on the shenanigans.  This is the PERFECT movie to put on after Macy's Parade, while all those who don't like football are helping prep for the big Turkey Day meal.  You sneak a bit of dressing or cranberry sauce, and watch a production number.  The plot is so user-friendly, missing five minutes here and there doesn't hurt. Treat yourself.  Discover why millions of views have made this movie a holiday favorite, despite the critics' opinions!~djkent rated NA on 11 November 1999"," Count me in with the saps who absolutely love this movie.: ""White Christmas"" is guilty of many of the sins catalogued by other commentators: its got a sappy story line, predictable plot twists, it plays outrageously for sentiment and patriotism (not your usual Christmas theme!). But I confess to having loved it from the first moment I saw it nearly a half century ago.  I, too, like many, make it a point to view it every Christmas season, along with much better holiday fare such as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street."" 	I think, contrary to many folks, that Danny Kaye succeeds in the second lead role better than Fred Astaire did in ""Holiday Inn,"" and while he isn't given an opportunity for his patented zaniness, he adds a thoroughgoing charm to the role that sometimes the rather stiff Astaire lacks. 	Rosemary Clooney is lovely in the rather thankless role of the practical sister and was at the peak of her genius as a pop singer, Vera-Ellen does her usually charming thing, and Crosby!  The master implants his genius in virtually every frame.  In supporting roles veteran character actor Dean Jagger is splendid as the general, while Mary Wickes steals every scene she's in as the nosy hotel housekeeper, Emma. 	The singing and dancing are first-rate (even without Astaire), and the songs by Irving Berlin are among his very best, including a number of tunes written especially for the film.  One that never ceases to charm me is the trifle, ""Snow,"" sung by our four stars in the dining car of the railroad train bound from Florida to Vermont.  What a magical moment, among many in this thoroughly delightful, if flawed, jewel.~bobj-3 rated NA on 13 October 2001"," A classic Christmas film and top selling song of all time: Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas"" movie almost was a classic when it came out in 1954. That's because the title song had been out for 12 years, and was made hugely popular after its first use in the 1942 film, ""Holiday Inn."" It won the Oscar that year for best original song. The song already had broken sales records and was an annual Christmas favorite. So, even with as long as it took 20th Century Fox to make the film, the movie was seen as a sure-fire hit musical and comedy romance. The delay was mostly in trying to fill the role of Phil Davis, played by Danny Kaye. Fred Astaire declined the role and Donald O'Connor became ill just before shooting began. Perhaps providence had a hand in the delay, because I don't think any long-time movie buffs today could imagine anyone other than Danny Kaye in that role. The movie premiered Oct. 14, 1954, and became the top moneymaking film for the year. It had $12 million in box office sales (about $105 million in 2014 dollars). The second highest grossing film that year was ""The Caine Mutiny,"" at $8.7 million. Moreover, the record sales of the song continued to ring up. According to Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's recording of ""White Christmas"" holds the world record as the best- selling single recording of all time. As of 2014, Crosby's recording tops 50 million, and the total sales of ""White Christmas"" by all recordings tops 100 million. Today this movie endures, along with ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as the two 'must' original films on all lists for annual family viewing over the holidays. Without a doubt, this is the best musical of the season. Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" is the third movie that is on most lists for annual viewing; but viewers have a choice of several different renditions to choose from. Any of four of those are very good. What's not to like about ""White Christmas?"" It's a wonderful story of the early musical play versions where the entertainment is the profession of the stars. The plot is very good, with some sub-plots interwoven. It's a nice romance and light comedy of the everyday life variety. And it has wonderful music, singing and dancing. This film is packed with talent. It has 17 songs – all written by Irving Berlin, and several dance numbers. The songs are a mix of previous numbers and entirely new ones. Several were Berlin hits that are still played today. Some have been used or can be heard in movies in the 21st century. Besides ""White Christmas,"" these include ""Heat Wave,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" and ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me.""Kaye has a couple dance numbers and one with Vera-Ellen who shows her dance talent in several other numbers. Rosemary Clooney plays half of the Haynes sisters act (as Betty) with Vera-Ellen's Judy; and she's also the romance interest with Crosby. Other top cast members include veteran actors Dean Jagger, Mary Wickes and Sig Ruman. Two future stars are in the music and dance cast – Barrie Chase and George Chakiris. ""White Christmas"" has one of the wittiest funny lines of filmdom. Kaye as Phil says to Crosby's Bob Wallace, ""My dear partner. When what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting whatever it is you've got left."" Another good example of the comedic banter between the two male stars is later. Bob is talking about Phil to Ed Harrison (played by Johnny Grant). ""I have complete confidence in him. When it comes to conniving and finagling, you can't beat this boy.""This wonderful film never wears thin for viewing year after year. The songs and dance numbers will always entertain any audience. And the story is a nice holiday tale of friendship, romance, kindness and fun. It's a classic that families will enjoy for generations to come.~SimonJack rated 10/10 on 29 December 2014"," I'm dreaming of... WHITE CHRISTMAS!: I absolutely ADORE this movie!  Have since the first time I saw it! Sure... some may classify it as simply a ""feel-good"" movie, but what's wrong with that?  Some may also classify it as pure schmaltz, but the movie truly does have it's sad points... like the priceless look on General Waverly's face whenever he enters the room where everyone who had been under his division is awaiting his arrival!The movie has a truly wonderful musical score, not to mention some VERY kick butt dancing!Bing Crosby is charming as Bob Wallace, a calm and reserved, yet witty and delightful and wise-cracking, and somewhat cynical kind of guy. Bing truly performed to his greatest.  And his vocal talent is enormous, not to mention evident throughout the entire movie!  It's a real treat to see him crack up when he and Danny Kaye are performing their rendition of ""Sisters""!Danny Kaye is hilarious as Phil Davis, the foil to calm and cool Bob. Phil, too, is full of wise-cracks, and very intent on getting Bob to settle down. Danny gave such a life to his character, portraying him like no other! His best one liner was when a young blonde with voice like nails on a chalk board says to him (after his phoney engagment to Judy) ""I sure wish it would happen to me!"") to which he replies ""So do I!""Rosemary Clooney is absolutely riveting as Betty Haynes, the older of the two Haynes sisters.  She is the most calm and most subdued.  She is looking for her ""knight on the white horse"" in life.  Rosemary played Betty to the fullest, making her every bit as believable as you could imagine!  And that voice... GOLDEN!  A gift from God!  It's a true treasure to see her in her solo ""Love (You Didn't Do Right By Me)"".  She's absolutely marvelous and extremely talented.Vera-Ellen is refreshingly delightful as Judy Haynes, the younger and more naive Haynes sister.  Judy is also the dreamer of the two.  Vera-Ellen does a wonderfully through job of portraying Judy!  She is a perfect foil to her older sister.  And those dancing stems... to see her dance in numbers like ""Mandy"" and ""Choreography"" is a real treat!  How ANYONE could ever dance as well as she is beyond me!  She really did a great job in this movie, even better than her performance in ""On The Town"" with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Betty Garrett.A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  GREAT CAST CHEMISTRY!!!!

""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"" and ""Sisters"" have become standards, of course. But, towering above them all, is Bing Crosby's definitive performance of the beloved Christmas favorite that he practically owned. All the performances are top-drawer, what with Bing, Danny Kaye (In a role meant for Donald O'Connor), Rosie Clooney, Vera-Ellen, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes, who, as you can see here, was playing nasty old things even when she was a nasty young thing!Corny, syrupy, kitsch. Perhaps it is all of that, to some. But, to unashamed sentimentalists like me, ""White Christmas"" will always be THE all-time great Christmas movie, particularly when viewed by the whole family, on Christmas Day, in front of the fireplace.God bless Bing, Berlin, and company, for making a lot of Holidays that much happier, including those of the Sorrentino family!~BobLib rated NA on 24 September 1999"," This Is Definitely My Favorite of the Classic Holiday Films!: I know, we've heard it all before, how the film, Holiday Inn is superior to this offering, but you'd never convince me of that!

Pollard|Alfre Woodard|Mabel King|John Murray|Jamie Farr|Robert Goulet|Buddy Hackett|John Houseman|Lee Majors,Richard Donner,Mitch Glazer|Michael O'Donoghue|Charles Dickens(suggestion),"A selfish, cynical television executive is haunted by three spirits bearing lessons on Christmas Eve."," Put a little love in your heart.: This is a perfect vehicle for Bill Murray, his brand of sarcastic and caustic delivery is nailed on perfect for Frank Cross, the modern day scrooge in this tale. I have often found him to be an acquired taste, I mean don't get me wrong here, I'm a big fan and can repeatedly watch his best offerings, but it's not hard to understand why his style is not universally loved. Scrooged is pure and simply the modern spin of the story we all have grown up with, that isn't to say that the film loses anything as regards Christmas spirit, because it doesn't, the message is still the same, and in this ever changing world of ours the core essence of the story is one the world should heed.This version is a blast, it's loud, it's brash, but boy is it damn funny, and I personally watch it every Christmas without fail. And yes, I watch it alongside the glorious Alistair Sim version, for although they are poles apart in class, they both entertain for very different reasons.Joining Murray in this festive romp is the delightful Karen Allen, while luminaries such as former New York Dolls front man David Johansen and Mr. Laconic himself, Robert Mitchum, add some weight to the cast list. It all works really rather well with the exception of Carol Kane's Ghost Of Christmas Present, where to me she comes off as being more annoying than funny, but that of course is a personal opinion and I know as fact that many others adore her energetic performance. With quips aplenty and of course with a simple heartfelt message at the core, Scrooged is truly a sharp and enjoyable film to be enjoyed at the festive period. Thanks boys, get the nurse! 8/10~hitchcockthelegend rated 8/10 on 4 March 2008"," The Night the Reindeer Died: Scrooged was a starring vehicle for Bill Murray who teamed up with director Richard Donner for this re-working of Dicken's A Christmas Carol.The movie is essentially a 'concept vehicle' a term in vogue at the time. A starring role for Murray, make him a high powered television executive and team him up with an action director who had success a year earlier with Lethal Weapon.Bill Murray is climbing the corporate media ladder as the ruthless, cynical, mean and heartless Frank Cross. In his office he has a sign which defines Cross. 'Something you nail people to!'For Christmas Murray has devised a multi location live television broadcast which has to be the show to watch with a strong promotional clip to publicise it which makes his fellow executives sick. However he has to contend with a rival, John Glover, there to help out but actually eyeing up his job.One night before Christmas his old television boss (John Forsythe) who has been dead for years visits him and tells him to mend his ways and informs him that he will be visited by three ghosts.They include the Ghost of Christmas past, a cigar smoking cab driver, the Ghost of Christmas Present, an angelic fairy who likes a bit of the rough stuff and certainly dishes it out, finally the Ghost of Christmas Future, a terrifying dark hooded figure who would certainly scare the kids.Each ghostly spectre takes Murray to a time and place. Such as when he was young and dorky working his way up in television and in love with Karen Allen. As time goes by he becomes obsessed with work and frustrated by Allen's do-gooder attitude.Murray actually calls on Allen when he his spooked out and finds out that she is helping out with the homeless but she stirs something in Murray who his still a Grinch.There is no Cratchit in this movie that part in effect goes to Alfre Woodard who plays Murray's secretary. Bobcat Goldthwait plays an executive whose life heads towards a downward spiral when he is dismissed by Murray.I remember the film was largely dismissed by critics when the film was released but it is rather an enjoyable reworking of Dickens's story. Murray despite not getting on with the director pitches it just right, almost remaining lovable even though he is mean spirited. I rather enjoyed his Richard Burton impression. The film has lots of star cameos from John Houseman, Lee Majors, Jamie Farr, Anne Ramsey and Robert Mitchum as Murray's cat obsessed boss.Director Richard Donner adds plenty of social commentary with references to apartheid South Africa for example.The ending might be regarded as tad sentimental which follows the book, but once they start singing the final song even you would want to 'Put a Little Love in Your Heart.'~Prismark10 rated 9/10 on 26 February 2016"," Bill Murray does an excellent job of creating a modern-day Ebeneezer Scrooge: Scrooged is a fresh, dark and original take on the classic Christmas Carol story. The ghosts are humorous and horrifying and Bill Murray does an excellent job of creating a modern-day Ebeneezer Scrooge. The ending is quite cheesy, but, then again, isn't that what Christmas movies are all about?~cricketbat rated 8/10 on 10 July 2018"," I get it now!: I just finished watching this film (on TNT) for the countless time. What a fine seasonal offering. It's so much better than a lot of the pulp and smarmy c*** that passes for Christmas classics.Bill Murray exclaims at the end of the movie, ""I get it now!"" Apparently, some folks watched this flick and didn't get it. The movie is essentially a star turn for Murray, who's in almost every frame - and that's fine with me because he can carry a film. Trivial quibbles over the movie's name and reference to the original work, the lack of faithfulness to the book and other complaints miss the point of the project. While staging a production of 'A Christmas Carol,' a TV executive experiences the very same circumstances as one of the characters in the novel. That alone makes it work. A few reviews question the overall harsh tone of the movie, or more specifically, Murray's role. Frankly, I would not have minded had it been even a little darker. There's a lot of water to carry in that bucket of trying to measure the callous and thoughtless manner in which some folks act on all but the most treasured of holidays. Murray's demeanour boils it down into one strong mean spirit and evaporates it with a truly positive and well-wishing finale.Scrooged is, along with Groundhog Day, among his best work.~Bwana-2 rated 8/10 on 23 December 2000"," You'll Either Love it or Hate it.: Well, Christmas is almost upon us again.

Starting with Scrooged:I personally enjoyed this film, but after reading other user's comments on here for the movie, I guess you either Love it or Hate it.Why do people get so serious about a movie ? Its just a comedy that pokes a little fun at the Dickens classic.They mention that Murray's character of Frank Cross was hateful, spiteful, nasty, horrible etc. etc. ... That was the whole idea!! (You wouldn't have had a movie if he wasn't those things). Scrooge in the novel was horrible, spiteful, nasty,  etc. etc. Scrooged is funny, but it does hit on a few serious notes also. Especially when Frank is visited by Carol Kane's Ghost of Christmas Present.Scrooged is the type of movie that no-one will ever agree on. They have their opinions, and I have mine.I love it. The bit at the end where Bill Murray finally realizes what Christmas is really all about, is quite moving as he talks directly to the viewers about it. Then when the cast break into song, Murray urges the Cinema audience to join in with them. The cinema we went to, did! It was a great atmosphere with the cinema singing along with the cast. And it was near Christmas too, which made it all that little bit more special :o)~jrb1802 rated NA on 10 November 2000"," One of the best holiday comedies ever. Very funny. **** out of ****: SCROOGED (1988) ****Starring: Bill Murray, Karen Allen, John Glover, John Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, David Johansen, and Alfre Woodard Director: Richard Donner   Running time: 101 minutes    Rated PG-13 (for violence, language, and sexual references)By Blake French:	""Scrooged"" is one of the top ten holiday comedies ever produced on the big screen. It enables a viewer to experience the true meaning of cinema: to jump out of our lives and experience another. Once in a long, long while we get a movie with as much magically irrelevant context as Richard Donnar's 1988 adaptation of Charles Dickens classic fable. ""Scrooged"" holds a place on my list of the top 100 American movies ever made.	The film takes place a few days before Christmas. Bill Murray stars as the heartless  Frank Cross, a corporate tightwad in charge of a highly profitable television company. This man seldom gives raises,  airs stomach churning TV ads, and fires desperate employees at the drop of a hat, regardless of what time of year it is. Currently, Frank's company is producing the first live Christmas program on network television, on Christmas eve. It is a Charles Dickens fable. Frank is at the prime of his life, living a wealthy, glamorous, but unhappy life.	His greed soon catches up with him, however, when one night his old boss visits him, who has now been dead for years. Frank is at first astonished; he thinks he is hallucinating. The talking corpse tells him that  very soon he will be introduced to three ghosts involuntarily. Franks then calls his old girlfriend, and continues on with his deprived life.Bill Murray plays his role straight, with intensity and imagination--just like everyone else in the cast. He acts like he is yelling at his workers, and they act like they are being yelled at. This is what generates the film all of its laughs. It takes the characters seriously, and the comical situations in which they are placed are what makes the film funny.	Each of the three ghosts visit Frank. They include The Ghost of Christmas past, a rough cigar smoking taxi driver, an angelic but brutal pink fairy, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the most feared ghost, Christmas Future, the death-resembling, dark capped figure. They each contribute a heartfelt, terrifying message to Frank, explaining to him how that he either needs to clean up his act and become a giving, generous man, or dastardly things will happen to him.   	The three ghosts are some of the most memorable characters ever seen in the movies. The human characters are also very interesting and entertaining. The filmmakers write each with distributive characteristics, provoking empathy and captivation. They are wonderfully portrayed as well.	The interlocking stories each related to each other in Richard Donnar's comedy classic as well. Each scene relates to the next with a strong, supportive narrative through line through Frank Cross.	''Scrooged'' definitely fits into the comedy genre, and offers copious amounts of laugh out loud material. There's even dialogue and sight gags that provoke laughter. On the other hand, the film doesn't lose track of its message by being all over the wall slapstick silliness. It leaves room for the emotions and feelings present. For this type of comedy to work, the humor needs to be played accurately. Some scenes involving the past of Frank are quite emotional, and the filmmakers use this to their advantage to develop the Frank character even further. ''Scrooged'' may be a spoof, but if still holds true to the classic story it is based on.	I also enjoyed the illustrious style this film uses: a mesmerizing blend of perfect set direction and colorful atmosphere. The sound track is very effective as well, with memorable tunes and voiceless medleys.  The closing scene of ''Scrooged'' may feel a bit contrived and fake, but it also allows us to leave the theater with joyful happiness inside. If this film doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit, nothing will.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.~Movie-12 rated 10/10 on 18 December 1999"," Starts well, gets a bit sentimental but Murray carries it: Francis Cross is a successful TV executive but at Christmas time he is about as miserable a man as you could wish to meet.  Forcing people to work over the holidays and unwilling to think of anyone but himself.  As Christmas Eve approaches Francis is visited by his dead boss, warning him to change his ways; when he doesn't he is visited by three ghosts who show him Christmas in the past, present and future.Each year there are plenty of versions of the classic Christmas Carol story, but this film is consistently one of the better ones.  It starts with a great dark comedy that sees some very imaginative gags (The Night The Reindeer Died) as well as Murray given great material.  At some point (roughly ghost 2), sentimentality starts to set in and the film doesn't quite have the edge on it that it did.  It still works - in fact, ghost 3 is not so much sentimental as really dramatic!What holds it all together though is a great performance from Murray.  He is funny throughout but also does the work to try and hold off the sentimentality of the piece - although it does come through, as one would expect with a Christmas movie!  The support cast is good and includes Woodard, Goldthwait, Goulet, Farr and Mitchum.  I didn't feel like Kane's Christmas Present really worked and didn't find her funny in the least. While the support cast add to the film, it is almost totally belonging to Bill Murray and the fact that it is so enjoyable is mostly due to him (although not even he can carry off the audience interaction over the end credits).Overall this is a good Christmas movie - it does give you a nice little festive glow but also has enough cynical edge to keep the syrup at bay for a certain amount of the time.  Regardless of everything else, Bill Murray is great in the lead and holds the movie together better than someone else may have been able to.~bob the moo rated NA on 25 December 2003"," Fun to watch every day of the year.: This is a Christmas movie that also is very enjoyable to watch outside of the holiday's.Another name for the movie could be ""The Bill Murray Show"", he simply makes this movie and I can't even imaging how the movie would have been without him in it. He's amazingly funny and on top of that he also is a wonderful actor. You can see that in some of the scene's he improvised a lot and he did that brilliantly! All the other actors and characters are merely sidekicks.The story is basically a modern version of the classic Dickens novel ""A Christmas Carol"" and it's done wonderfully. It's great to see how the the classic story is translated into the 20th century. Everything works very well: The settings, the characters and the events, everything.From the hilarious opening involving Santa Claus and Lee Mayors (I say no more) till the wonderful ending the movie delivers non stop fun and pure entertainment with a nice love story, brilliant dialog and a great and important message in it. Only thing is that I feel that the movie could have done without the whole Loudermilk thing, but oh well...Very recommendable and close of being perfect.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/~Boba_Fett1138 rated 9/10 on 20 August 2003"," Puts A Little Love In Your Heart: Charles Dickens's classic Christmas tale gets a late 20th Century makeover with Bill Murray as our protagonist. Murray plays a hardboiled TV executive who only sees Christmas as a commercial opportunity to get the best ratings. The usual ghosts from Christmases past, present, and future visit Murray and in a more contemporary idiom explain the error of his ways. No need to explain this universally beloved plot, I think other than the Christmas story itself, more people know this story than any other in the English speaking world.A couple of Hollywood veterans John Forsythe and Robert Mitchum have some nice supporting roles. Both are TV executives, Forsythe from his past and who Bill Murray was something of a protégé. Robert Mitchum is the Bill Paley/David Sarnoff network tycoon and who already sees some flaws in Murray's approach and is grooming a smarmy John Glover to take his place.The Bob Cratchit part is split in two with Murray's secretary going home to a not so Merry Christmas with the family when the expected bonus she was counting on doesn't materialize, she gets a network monogrammed towel like everyone else. She's played by Alfre Woodard and she's drowning in some real 20th century debt. The junior executive Murray fires is Bobcat Goldthwait and he doesn't take his Christmas Eve sacking in the resigned frame of mind the original Cratchit it. As this is the ever zany Goldthwait his method of dealing with it is unorthodox.The spirits of the past, present, and future are played by David Johanssen, Carol Kane, and Michael J. Pollard. Of the three and in fact in the film Carol Kane is the best. She certainly has an original way of getting one's attention.Karen Allen plays the girl that Murray loved and lost and Scrooged gives him an interesting opportunity to make that up as well as change his way of living. Scrooged is first and foremost a Bill Murray show and Bill Murray delivers on all levels. All the spirit of Dickens is maintained, in fact when the cast in the finale starts singing Put A Little Love In Your Heart over the closing credits, isn't that what Charles Dickens meant to say what Christmas does?~bkoganbing rated 8/10 on 18 October 2011"," Great, modern take: This is a modern take on the classic Christmas story about Ebeneezer Scrooge from the story A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. To say that there was a lot of creative license taken here would be an understatement, but that does not detract from the fact that this is a great social comment on how commercialized Christmas has become. Bill Murray plays Frank Cross, a television network head that is trying to put on a live version of A Christmas Carol. He is driving his people like slaves and even tells someone to staple antlers to a mouse because they would not stay. He fires a member of his team on Christmas Eve for disagreeing with something he said. He has led a life of greed and cut off anyone that stood in his way, including his brother. That night he is payed a visit from fours ghosts, the first being his mentor, followed by the ghost of Christmas past, present and future. I am sure you are all familiar with the telling of this story. David Johnson and Carol Kane as the ghost of past and present respectively, steal the show. This is a great movie and should be enjoyed by all, every year.~acedj rated 8/10 on 21 November 2019"

I found it sweet and very entertaining at times. The four stars, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black are very talented actors, and their performances take centre stage here. Kate Winslet was lovely as Iris, but I was really delighted with Cameron Diaz as Amanda, especially when she is seen wearing stilettos in the snow. At my first viewing the whole cinema were like ""How does she do that?"" I also thought their exchange on the phone was hilarious too. As the men, I really liked Jack Black as Miles, a perfect blend of subtlety and spirit. Jude Law, an actor who isn't always my cup of tea, does very well indeed, as Diaz's new friend Graham. This tells the story of two women who swap homes and make lifelong friends, or something along the lines of that. My sister has this on DVD and absolutely loves it. I have only two quibbles with this movie, the script is a little weak and frothy at times, and there are some places where the story is underdeveloped. Still a beautiful-looking and hugely enjoyable film. 8/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 8/10 on 11 May 2009"," Swiss Chocolate of Romantic Comedies: Do you like chocolate? Do you know that moment, even before you put it in your mouth? You can imagine that taste. You can feel that rich sweetness on your tongue, the smoothness going around your mouth . . .The Holiday is a romantic comedy. You know what that means. And if you don't like romantic comedies, don't go and see it. If you do, you will know what to expect. The mushy feelings creeping up on you. All those 'If Only . . .' emotions telling you there is a lovely place somewhere in which people fall in love and everything works out kinda perfect. If only for a while . . . say, for the holiday period over Christmas and New Year . . . or for the 138 minutes which this film lasts.Two Women on the Verge of Emotional Breakdown do holiday house swap. They escape lovelorn predicaments and find 'unexpected' love on their opposite sides of the Atlantic. Cue picturesque English country house just the way Americans imagine it (with sheep out the back). Cue enormous L.A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it).Cameron Diaz is Amanda, owner of a movie-trailers editing firm. Since she's played the same comedy character several times, there are few surprises; but an excellent script, written directly for her and the other three leading stars, projects it rather better than average. Kate Winslet as Iris, a successful writer on The Telegraph, is more nuanced: an actor with considerable range, we cannot but help admire the way she does 'pathetic girl' rather beautifully in a role that she could manage with one hand counting the ways to have fun and get paid simultaneously.Formulaic it is (wonderful women with scoundrelly fellas eventually get The Real Men They Deserve - meeting puppy dogs, children, and falling snowflakes on the way of course). But, well-done within a narrow genre, it still stands out. No-brainers like this tend to have dumb scripts and dumber acting, but The Holiday contains warm, natural dialogue and heartfelt chemistry. If this was the 40's, you'd want Jude Law and Cameron Diaz to get married off-screen afterwards. Charismatic and entertaining, unless you find Diaz, Law or Winslet personally irritating (some people do), they are a joy to watch, filling their parts with love and light. Excellent production values keep the rather trite story flowing. Everything is picture-perfect, long lenses flattering the features of the already handsome stars, filters and soft-focuses carefully delineating the mood.There is an overall honesty to the performances. ""You look like my Barbie!"" delights a four-year-old excitedly to Diaz. Ironic? But said with so much affection it is self-deprecating rather than cutting. Jack Black struggles to get out of his music-and-silly-faces typecasting but just manages to look the part for an intellectual Iris who is not attracted to skin-deep. Jude Law, on the other hand, could be an advert for men's skin cream, and too rounded a character to be mere pin-up material.With more Christmas songs than you can shake a piece of tinsel at, The Holiday is a warm, snuggly romance to lose yourself in before coming firmly back down to planet earth. It might be shallow, but it's seasonal entertainment - and a Swiss chocolate of romantic comedies.~Chris_Docker rated 7/10 on 28 November 2006"," Enjoyable escapism: I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) fed up with their love lives; Amanda's boyfriend has been cheating on her and the man Iris loves has just got engaged to someone else. They both decide to switch houses for Christmas for an escape from their complicated lives; so Iris jets off to Amanda's place in sunny L.A and Amanda goes to Iris' quaint cottage in snowy Surrey, England (if only it really did snow at Christmas!) Amanda soon meets Iris' handsome brother Graham (Brilliantly played by Jude Law) and Iris meets musician Miles (Jack Black) and you can guess the rest...The acting is strong and well handled. At first i found Cameron Diaz hugely annoying but as it went on i warmed to her character; she and Jude had lots of chemistry and their relationship was handled well and Graham's secret was a good twist.I thought Jack Black was great in this different role, he and Kate also had chemistry and he was totally believable. I wish their storyline had been a bit longer though as they spent way more time on Cameron and Jude's part.Kate Winslet as usual was funny and touching as Iris and maybe one of the best parts of the film was her relationship with the old man (Eli Wallach) they both seemed to have a connection and it was nice to hear his stories of when he was a writer in the good old Hollywood days when he knew Cary Grant and co! If you want beautiful scenery, escapism from the millions of horror and action films out there and good characterisation, than this is for you. It's not as soppy as other rom/com's and it's easy to identify with the characters, it's also very festive and my dad even liked it and he hates romantic films!~kclambeth rated 8/10 on 17 May 2007"," Almost Like Old Times: Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!~carlostallman rated 7/10 on 10 February 2007"," Found no fault at all: The Holiday (2006) is an out of the ballpark smash hit! I thought about it after seeing it and just seriously could find NO fault whatsoever. This is such a feel good, cute, romantic, and sweet film. And it's not one of those stupid run of the mill romance movies, it actually has depth and is well made. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are two women recently out of relationships with men, and pretty fed up with life in general, so they decide to go on vacation. They switch houses, Cameron goes to stay in England in Kate's house, and Kate goes to Los Angeles to stay in Cameron's house. The plot in and of itself is interesting and draws you in to keep watching. The script is well written and original, with little sparks of comedy thrown in where needed. And then there are scenes where we get to know our characters, usually through deep conversations with them and other characters. There definitely are NOT cardboard cut out one dimensional characters here, they are characters with real life issues, true depth, and interesting backgrounds. The romance and chemistry between the couples is great! It's truly eclectic and comes so wonderfully natural. I also love the side plot between Kate Winslet and the older screenwriter next door neighbor, it's so undeniably cute and so sweet, it's just endearing, I actually cried during the scene where he is honored at that ceremony! 10/10 for The Holiday! It's so well deserved!~davispittman rated 10/10 on 10 June 2016"," A good date movie that is entertaining and sweet: (Synopsis) Two beautiful women, Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) both find themselves at the end of failed relationships just before Christmas.

But things are about to change when Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) drops by Iris' house and meets Amanda. On the other side of the world, Iris meets Miles (Jack Black) a film composer. Romance is in the air and sparks are about to fly.(My Comment) If you want to see a romantic comedy with real chemistry, especially between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law this is one chick flick you must see. This movie is a good date movie that is actually entertaining and sweet. You are actually seeing two love stories instead of one. There is a great subplot of the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's character that will touch your heart. Actually, I enjoyed that part of the movie the best. Overall, the movie was enjoyable to watch with touching and funny scenes throughout the movie. The ending is predictable, but what do you expect, it is a romantic comedy. You will leave the movie feeling good, and isn't that what movies are all about. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:18, Rated PG-13)(8/10)~the-movie-guy rated 8/10 on 8 December 2006"," Funny, but some casting issues: This somewhat odd but distinctly likable film involves two women, one in L.A. and one in London, both unhappy in love, who switch homes to shake up their lives.The movie is often funny and sometimes touching, with solid performances from all. Perhaps the biggest issue is the absence of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jack Black, which gives the movie a false note that could have been avoided if it wasn't so determined to follow the standard romantic comedy path. Winslet has much better chemistry with Eli Wallach, wonderful as an aged scriptwriter.One interesting thing to note is Jude Law, whose handsome, empathetic, nurturing, understanding character could best be described as lady porn, plays the sort of role usually played by a woman: the perfect person, wonderful in every way, whose main role in the story is to allow the main character to transition to a new phase in their life.It's not a great movie, and I don't love the structure, which simply involves cutting back and forth between two unrelated stories, but it's a nice feel-good chick flick thing that is perfect for days you don't want your brain to work too hard.~cherold rated 7/10 on 29 August 2019"," Twice the rom-com: Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement.

He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours.

Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. Neither of these women have ever met before, but they both want to escape for the holidays, so they talk online and decide to swap houses and automobiles for two weeks, so in other words Amanda would be staying at Iris's house in England and Iris would be staying at Amanda's house in California. Once they both reach their destinations they are both pretty bitter about men, but each of them soon meets different men in their lives who mean a lot to them and may make their holiday something to remember. The Holiday has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good original music. At first I wasn't really getting into this film and thought it would be a film that would probably appeal more to a woman than to me. Also the Amanda character played by Cameron Diaz annoyed me at first and I found her kind of artificial and ego centric. However as the film played on I found myself really liking this film. The characters grew on me and I found quite a bit to like about this movie. The chemistry between all the different characters works very well and their parts are all quite well written and the actors playing them each do a good job. I found that the film also developed and showed a lot about these characters which I enjoyed because the more I got to know about them the more I liked them and they were able to grow on me more. Each character in this film brings something unique to the table by being different and by really making this film more interesting than perhaps it sounds. The really rewarding thing about this film is how well the characters work with one another and that they are well written and well acted. This film is a romantic comedy and for the most part a lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because I find them silly and more for the female viewer than the male viewer, but this movie offers a lot of humour, heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy.

It has good music, a strong storyline, great characters, nice humor, and a message to all the people like us who are too much into the world of social media now, that we have lost our own identity, our own pleasures, our own life. The movie makes us question our choices, our daily routine, in a very subtle way. The movie is about three friends who have their own battles going on, one who is a gym freak, another who is a creative business mind, while the last one, the funny guy, and their traumas of life. It felt complete to me, the way they have shown the struggles of life, each one facing their own demons, it is very relatable, I just wanted some deep dialogues to be honest, that would have made this one a much better watch. The songs are great, not memorable, but with deep lyrics indeed. The last 20 minutes are very intense, and it will make you cry, if you have a past trauma. The first half is like a honeymoon period of everyone's life, with small inconveniences, but the movie escalates to the dark reality of everyday struggle, really quickly. People who have faced them in real life, will relate more, and those who don't, I hope you never do, but someday you will.

Did the makers think Kho Gaye would be 3rd film to join the ranks of those two? Dunno, time will tell, but for now, watch this film ifYou're a fan of DCH/ZNMD/Rock On and like watching movies about friendshipYou're tired of over-the-top action movies that have released this yearYou're a 20something and have a mostly 'Gen-Z life'Acting: Ananya Panday - her best work yet, happy that she got a role to showcase what she can do after all that backlash and nepotism fiasco. Adarsh Gourav - What a different role from his previous works. Wouldn't have expected him to pull off this role with such ease. Siddhant Chaturvedi - hit/miss but still convincing in what was written for him.The film was well shot. Apparently, the music is popular too....? I wouldn't know. It's different from the commercial mirch masala movies that only offer escapism and machismo. If any of ^ appeals to you, you should watch this film...with your friends.That said.....the audience of this film will likely fall into two buckets:1 - A group who will likely that DCH/Zindagi were a class apart and Kho Gaye comes nowhere close, but will still agree with the messaging.2 - A group that will find it to be some of the most relatable content out there and possible look back at it in 10-15 years and cry their eyes out like group 1 does about DCH/Zindagi, as if it was written about their own lives.Kho Gaye seems to have been made for a specific audience and does it well. That said, it does try very hard to be very relatable and it shows. Where DCH/ZNMD won was that these were merely stories of friends living their lives and didn't necessarily have stuff specifically written in so that the audience can relate to. You can tell Kho Gaye is trying too hard to be relevant - not that there's anything wrong with it, just didn't feel smoothly written. The songs, dunno, nowhere close to being as iconic as stuff from first two, DCH especially, this includes the lyrics. A Gen Z is likely to look at the characters, maybe 2/3 and say, these are rich people issues and I don't have the privilege of this. You can't necessarily say that about the first two movies even though we had Australia and Bagvati; if you know, you know.That said, I'd much rather watch this film over some of the other stuff that has released this year. In my books, Kho Gaye > Pathaan, Jawan, Leo, King of Kotha, Salaar, etc. While I didn't enjoy HOW the story is being told, the WHAT is being told is relevant, it's the world we live in and the messaging needs to be acknowledged.Watch it with your friends. :)~TreeFiddy53 rated 7/10 on 27 December 2023"," Refreshing, young and best: Netflix movie KHO Gaye Hum Kahan directed by debutant director Arjun Varain Singh this movie is produced by Farhan Akthar written by Zoya Akhtar, Reema Kagti, Arjun Singh starring Siddhanth Chaturvedi, Adarsh Gaurav, Ananya Pandey, Kalki Koechlin.It's a typical Gen 'Z' movie relatable story about today's generation and how they are impacted with social media, how social media influences our life, how we start comparing our lifes with others looking at the social media updates be it Facebook or instagram.Story is fresh , excellent direction and good music. A good social message is delivered at the end.Songs are fresh and for a change loved this bollywood movie. It reminded me about Dil chahtha hey and Zindagi na milegi Dobara types movies.The story is about 3 freinds (Siddharth, Adarsh and Ananya) they are young, confused, ambitious and like the Gen Z their life goes thru lots of ups and downs and emotional due to society pressures, past issues , relationships issues and social media impacts.Performance wise all 3 actors were top notch their chemistry worked very well and they did a awesome job. Surprised to see Ananyas performance she nailed it .This film is definitely aimed at a younger demographic but its realism and rawness in its portrayal make it an appealing watch for a large audience. Probably a film that won't ever get the appreciation it deserves but worth a watch for sure!Worth watching this during the holiday seasonHighly recommend#ananyapanday #khogayehumkahanonnetflix #khogayehumkahan #SiddhantChaturvedi #AdarshGourav #netflixmovies #netflixrecommendations #hindimovie #moviereview.~nairabh rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Mast Movie hai: A good movie credit definitely should go to this amazing debutant director Arjun Varain Singh. The real talent of any artist is not revealed unless the director is good. And Arjun has shown very clearly that he is a very talented director. Be it Ananya pandey, Adarsh Gaurav or Siddhant Chaturvedi it is everyone's best performance till date. The story is very hard hitting and this bew generation people will really connect to the story.

First of all, I would like to thank the makers.The subject of the movie is very good and timely. There was a need for a movie on such a subject for a long time. How the digital generation is becoming isolated from society and creating an invisible wall around themselves. The most effect is that generation, that is what the movie showed.I saw the good side that stand up comedy has been given so much space. With a smile, everyone in the society has pointed out the disease of today's society.The acting, songs, BGM, cinematography in the movie are all highly commendable. But the hero of the film is the script. Impossibly beautiful. I was very reminded of the back mirror while watching the movie.Highly recommended basically young generation.~debojyotichakraborty-24116 rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Refreshing Tale of Modern Times and Friendship in the insecure world of Social Media: Liked this one. Social Media today works on 3 I's - Instant, Insecurity and I (Narcissism) and the film captures all the 3 themes pretty well.Strong performances and refreshing tale of modern friendship is well captured after Dil Chahta Hai and ZNMD. Always have been a fan of Excel Entertainment, Zoya Akhtar and Rima Kagti's work hence the film was certainly a good watch, quite relevant with the themes of today.Adarsh Gaurav as Neil shines through and has a pretty emotional upheaval among the 3 which is very well portrayed on screen. The character has a roller-coaster arc which is well justified by his talent.Have been a fan of Siddhant Chaturvedi since Gully Boy and this feels no different - the guy delivers a wonderful performance, especially the dialogue towards the end that shows his prowess as an actor.Ananya Pandey, usually bubbly, is a charm on screen and portrays her character pretty well, which is a difficult mix of displaying insecurity yet be confident. She is the mediator between the extremes of the other 2 characters which she justifies very proficiently.First part is good and it is all relate-able, though not in the exact manner or form. The part after the halfway mark feels a bit of drag as interest does lose, primarily because its a predictable end but the message the film is trying to give is loud and clear.Generations, be it millenials or Gen Y or Gen Z should all take away something from this film and remember that at the end of the day, in this world of instant and insecurities and comparision, it is important to be grateful, be close to friends and smile!~BlackHawk1120 rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," The trio of Ananya, Adarsh and Siddhant worked their magic!: A modern story for today's people, particularly those who live and breathe in the vast, demanding world of social media and the Internet.""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" is a sincere, sympathetic account of their triumphs, difficulties, and stories in general, while also putting emphasis on the positive aspects of these virtual platforms as well as the negative impacts they may have on our lives.Our ever-shrinking attention span, the constant craving for validation, and the lack of emotional connection are all challenges to which I feel we can all identify, at least to some extent.Furthermore, the script is quite effective here as are the characters, you grow so attached to them, their private lives, and I must say, whomever had thought of casting Ananya, Adarsh, and Siddhant as the lead trio deserves to be applauded.Not only did they gel so well, but they also appeared and acted like real-life best friends, with absolutely no trace of superficiality anywhere, so we ended up loving and rooting for the bond and friendship they shared.~SoumikBanerjee1996 rated 7/10 on 27 December 2023"," Loved it: I can say this in full confidence that this is one of the best performance by Ananya Pandey after Gehraiyaan..Sidhant Chaturvedi as always mesmerizing by his looks and for his acting skills we all know how good of an actor he is..Adarsh Gaurav we all have seen him in guns and gulab and have been appreciated for his performance in it and trust me you will love his performance in this too. Super star caste and super duper hit movie it is. This movie is all about friendship, and friendship in this social media ear and all other relationship. This film is introspective but never indulgent . I loved the secondary characters also .~krunaldesai-79352 rated 10/10 on 26 December 2023"," KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN:-an important film on social media culture.: Kho gaye hum kahan is a comedy drama romantic film directed by arjun varain singh.The film's first half is very happy go lucky. The friendship is fleshed out, the acting is all in place. We are given a peek into the three primary characters' lives, their happiness, their insecurities, their sadness. The writing never overwhelms us with the sadness and morbidity. The characters have aspirations, it gets its fuel from their friendship itself. Nearing the interval, a spat between the two male friends happens which leads to the primary crux of the film, i.e them confronting their fears. Its written very well, but definitely have some convenient plotholes. Ahana yells at neil for exposing an opportunistic, gold digger, when she herself had made a scene at her ex's birthday, who is also a very ugly person. But I like the fact that the film does not try to make its characters politically correct. They are hypocrites in their rights, knowingly or unknowingly. The standup bits of imaad are well written, extracting many chuckles.The film has many dialogues which try to explain to the viewers about the characters' state of mind. That's needless and very demeaning to the adult viewers. Monologues at the end seem to swirl around the film, serving little purpose. The chemistry between imaad and simran is very half baked.The last standup skit where imaad comes out of his trauma is one of the strongest scnes of the film. Siddhant chaturvedi and adarsh gaurav are two highly promising actors. Adarsh gaurav, especially, is the star of this film. Got a very meaty role and clutched onto it. Siddhant has a problem with crying, or maybe his character was a bit emotionally distant. Ananya panday us good, has gotten better over the years but needs to keep hardworking. Her dialogue delivery is still very outlandish. Kalki koechlin is very good, so is rohan gurbaxani. The music is great, the songs are very peppy and fresh. The cinematography is good. The camera mainly traverses closed spaces which conveys the mindspaces of the characters. They are open in the out but their souls are somewhere locked inside them, inside social media.~puranjanbasak rated 9/10 on 2 January 2024"
Past Lives (2023) - IMDb,8.0,Greta Lee|Teo Yoo|John Magaro|Moon Seung-ah|Leem Seung-min|Ji Hye Yoon|Choi Won-young|Ahn Min-Young|Seo Yeon-Woo|Kiha Chang|Shin Hee-Chul|Jun Hyuk Park|Jack Alberts|Jane Kim|Noo Ri Song|Si Ah Jin|Yoon Seo Choi|Seung Un Hwang,Celine Song,Celine Song,"Nora and Hae Sung, two deeply connected childhood friends, are wrested apart after Nora's family emigrates from South Korea. Twenty years later, they are reunited for one fateful week as they confront notions of love and destiny."," Like a Stephen Sondheim Song Come to Life: ""Past Lives"" is like a Stephen Sondheim song come to life.You know the song ""The Road You Didn't Take"" from ""Follies?"" How it's all about the different doors that exist along the path of life, but you only get to enter one at a time, leaving you to wonder what was behind the other doors. And that one path isn't necessarily better or worse than another, just different. And that you'll never know what was behind the doors you didn't choose, and that anyway time will eventually smooth over the regret you feel at not choosing them instead. Except that it doesn't always, and you may never stop completely regretting the life you think you might have had, even if you don't really mind the life you do have.This movie is that song. It's watching a beautifully defined female character convince herself and her husband that her life is what she wants it to be, and that she doesn't wish she'd taken a chance on the childhood sweetheart who comes back into her life after years apart and with whom she has off the charts chemistry. The actors who play the sweethearts as adults, Greta Lee and Teo Yoo, are both exceptional, but it's Lee who creates the most fascinating character. A bit cold, a bit distant, not always even completely likable in a way that's hard to define, a bit casually cruel to her husband who by anything the movie shows us can't be judged as anything other than a good, solid, and super understanding guy. But then there's that last scene that took my breath away, when we see the resolve not to feel emotions that would be inconvenient to feel give way, and we realize just how much has been roiling underneath the surface of Lee's character all along. It's magnificent and earned its right to leave me a quivering mess.The movie is also a sensitive look at what it feels like to be an immigrant, torn between two cultures, and not sure whether the nostalgia you feel is what you really want or just the allure of the familiar.A really great bit of counterprogramming in a summer that seems to be dishing up nothing but Marvel movies.Grade: A.~evanston_dad rated 9/10 on 11 July 2023"," Beautiful, touching film: ""If you had never left Seoul, would I have still looked for you? Would we have dated? Broken up? Gotten married? Would we have had kids together?""Such a touching film, but at the same time, never cloying, because the script and direction from Celine Song were so wonderfully restrained. I liked how it acknowledged the random little things in our lives that all have to add up in a certain way for us to end up with our partner in life, things in retrospect which are kind of mind-boggling, but at the same time, gave a certain nod to the idea of fate, the Buddhist ""in-yun"" concept of meeting someone again and again in our reincarnations until it reaches the threshold that allows for marriage. The characters were beautifully drawn and didn't devolve into cliches, an example of which was the husband who gave a master class in being understanding and supportive. Beautiful cinematography too. Definitely one to see.~gbill-74877 rated 9/10 on 19 June 2023"," Painfully good: Past Lives hurts. It's sort of like all the movies in the Before Trilogy rolled into one, and if the two people there had first parted ways in childhood. It also made me think about some recent films, like The Worst Person in the World, Return to Seoul, and Aftersun. It's got more in common with the first two than the last of those, but I guess they're all going to form a 2020s Quadrilogy of Sadness in my mind (much more memorable than a Triangle of the same thing).Maybe Quadrilogy of Longing or Regret is a better name. These are all films that grapple with regrets of the past and uncertainties of the future. They largely centre on young characters, and all demonstrate that cinema is not dead or bankrupt on ideas if filmmakers like the ones behind these are still finding new, interesting, and uncompromising ways to make viewers feel very moved. I do compare Past Lives to those, but I should also say it in no way feels derivative. The emotional and narrative experience it offers is still distinct and undeniably effective.When it comes to Past Lives, there were just a couple of scenes where I thought the dialogue was laying it on a little thick, but this film's otherwise hard to fault. It has great performances, and a real understated beauty to the visuals that I really loved. Part of me wonders how it would've resonated if I'd seen it at a different age, but I feel like anyone who's in their 20s or 30s and is currently feeling a little vulnerable in life will find this one hits hard - maybe even too hard, because it strikes a nerve and feels raw in the best (and most difficult) way possible.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 9/10 on 12 September 2023"," Sometimes simple stories are the best.: And first-time director Celine Song has created one of these. It's a masterpiece of deeply genuine human emotion. And that masterpiece is Past Lives.Song's dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters' true psychology.A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it's all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.This very well may be the best film of 2023. It's the work of a master storyteller, and it's only her first film.~benjaminskylerhill rated 10/10 on 23 June 2023"," Closure In Love: I've always bemoaned how cinema caters now to the children and that there are no adult films. Here is one that treats the audiencem that have the opportunity to watch itm as adults. While it does play like a stage play (most likely because director/writer Celine Strong is a playwriter) it doesn't take away the fact of the ideas within it.The story is of two Korean kids, who are in love, by their kid standards. They most likely spent years since childhood walking to school and spending countless days together. In the break, it is an unceremonious goodbye. Words escape them as we would want them to express their feelings. You won't get that here. Nora and her family make it to Canada, and finds it difficult to assimilate into her school.Hae Sung, meanwhile, stays back in Korea to go through the mandatory military service.12 years past. And now Hae Sung curiously has reached out to Nora. They begin an internet relationship which never crosses over to romantic, but you can feel a deep connection. It's closeness. While Nora has now moved on to New York, Hae Sung is now in college to study engineering.They spent countless time re-living their lives through the internet, but eventually, Nora realizes this has been holding her back. She makes the difficult decision to stop talking to Hae Sung so they can grow since neither can invest real time together. Hae Sung reluctantly agrees.Another 12 years past, and we now are the point where Nora is married to another writer. He is an American and, though finds ways to express his love to Nora, there is still a little bit of distance. Since Nora has roots deep in Korea. Hae Sung is a working man now and decides to visit Nora.The rest of the story is up for you to watch. I will say, it is pretty brutally honest. For anyone who has gone through long distance relationships, loved and lost and then re-connected in some way, what follows in the film may bring up raw feelings. But director Song REALLY wants you to overlook the ""what could've been aspect"" to the idea that there are just people in life you have a connection with, but never can be with them in a tangible world that we can see now. The spiritual nature/philosophical idea is similar to a metaverse concept. But isn't done in a way like Marvel does. It's about connections and the inarticulate way we cannot understand why we have these people in our lives.If you are self-aware of your life, you tend to consider these possibilities. Though the movie lingers slowly, the poetic nature of their silence will either calm you or make you frustrated that it hasn't moved faster. This movie is VERY much for grown ups. The themes need you to live a life where many people come through your life in order for you to appreciate what the tone of it ultimately means. There are no answers here. Only solid performances by its two leads, Greta Lee and Teo Yoo. They are fantastic in playing thought processes out.It's a deep story of love that requires you invest some of your own brain power to enjoy. Feel the ache of love.~statuskuo rated 8/10 on 17 June 2023"," What I learned from it: Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.~elisavbizau rated 9/10 on 11 December 2023"," beautiful and moving: Past Lives is a beautifully understated and emotionally resonant film about the power of love, loss, and second chances. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), two childhood friends who are reunited 20 years after they were separated by Nora's family's emigration from South Korea. The film explores the complex emotions that arise when these two old friends reconnect, as they grapple with the choices they've made in their lives and the possibility of what might have been.Song's direction is assured and sensitive, and she elicits outstanding performances from her two leads. Lee and Yoo are both incredibly charismatic and believable as Nora and Hae Sung, and their chemistry is undeniable.The film's cinematography is gorgeous, with Shabier Kirchner's lens capturing the beauty of both Seoul and New York City. The film's score is also superb, with a haunting and evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's emotional tone.Past Lives is a beautifully made and deeply moving film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It's a film about love, loss, and the power of second chances, and it's sure to resonate with anyone who has ever experienced the pain of separation or the joy of reunion.Rating: 4 out of 5 starsSome of the things that I particularly liked about the film include:The film's understated and realistic depiction of love and relationships.The film's sensitive and nuanced portrayal of the Asian American experience.The film's beautiful cinematography and evocative score.The film's two lead performances, which are both incredibly charismatic and believable.Overall, I thought Past Lives was a beautiful and moving film that is sure to stay with me long after I've seen it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thoughtful and emotionally resonant film to watch.~TheBigSick rated NA on 25 June 2023"," Someone who leaves: When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I was worried that it was going to be one of those cringe love story movie that exploits the Asian American hype in cinema. My concerns were all dispelled rather quickly. Celine Song's debut feature, ""Past Lives"" is a story of nostalgia and longing. It's less about romantic love because the movie makes it clear that Hae-sung and Na-young are never really in love with each other. There were many scenes where them being together contrasted with several couples around them. They were close but not intimate. Nobody ever crosses the line and remain as friends who long for each other.I also want to comment how well written the husband's character is. He is married into a foreign culture and he probably always worried about him not being ""Korean""makes him somehow an inadequate partner. He worries that his relationship somehow got in the way of Nora's immigrant dreams. While he has his own insecurities about the relationship and Hae-sung (who is by all standards, a 10/10 idealistic man), he accepts Nora's longing and embraces her as she cries after sending away Hae-sung. He understands that it's not about a romantic feeling but saying goodbye to one of the few connections and nostalgia to her home country.The entire movie also had technically surprising moments, making it hard to believe that this is a feature debut. It is filled with beautiful, sensitive shots that capture New York and Seoul pretty well. The music is dreamy and I've been spamming the soundtrack. Subtlety is well preserved and that's what i look for in movies. Dialogues were expertly captured with the director often using the technique of giving the focus to the listener rather than the speaker - directing the audience's attention to the reaction of what is being said.Overall, a beautiful film with little to criticize. One comment I have is that the accent in the Koreans were a little funny. However, I think it captures the awkwardness well enough. Being bilingual in Korean and English usually makes me bothered in watching films like this but I was not this time. Translations were also done pretty well, thankfully (this is SO important for me).~dannylee-78082 rated 9/10 on 15 July 2023"," Romance finally feels real: I'm nearly emotionless staring at this screen as I try to piece together my thoughts from a deeply moving film. Past Lives is purely honest, heartfelt, and piercingly direct with the evolution of its story, let alone with the natural growth its two lead characters. The score patiently guides the emotions of the audience, heightened by steady framing and extended sequences from a gorgeous color scheme to create an overwhelmingly tense presence in its tone, but never crossing that line in doing so. You feel the most out of every moment because the film puts trust in the fact that you will. The concluding sequence is a testament to the formatting of this entire story as the writing positions you to finally see and feel exactly as these characters do, and that's the ingredient that makes this experience so special. A true romance film crafted for our understanding and psychological reflection in 2023 and one that'll remain timeless for generations to come.~spencermcook rated 9/10 on 28 June 2023"," Fragile Longing: The wind, the leaves, the streets, the towers; everything exists with a supple glow. There's a love for environment behind the camera, where director Celine Song stands, telling her story. Kirchner, her cinematographer, lends immense craft to the film's 35mm scenery. Nora, Hae Sung, Arthur; the three central characters are handled with wonderful grace. They easily communicate complex emotion. They're likable, and they're relatable. New York City, Seoul; I hardly know either of them practically, but now I feel like I do, in some intimate way. These two cities are dearly loved. Longing; what did you think of when you finished this film?Past Lives is an honest, delicate, and ambling movie. Nora, once a little girl from urban Korea, chooses her path as an American writer after immigrating with her family. She marries a different writer (Arthur, a Jewish New Yorker), adopts the culture of NYC, and chases her ambition. She's still Korean, but the identity ebbs. She doesn't sound like it anymore. Hae Sung, her childhood friend who never left the country, is very much Korean; his path is that of an engineer living with his parents, which he describes as ordinary. He loves Nora deeply. He loved her when she left Seoul at twelve, and loved her still at the points in which their lives intersected. Nora loves him too, in her own complicated, almost grieving way. He is her connection to a childhood she longs for, washed away in her memories, and seldom revisited because of the complicated feelings that come with being a child immigrant.The story is simple but it bursts at the seams with emotion and humor. Admittedly slow, but without wasting your time. I connected with all three of the main characters to some degree, each carried by an actor with the apparent gravity of a veteran superstar. They are emotionally intelligent, and they react to each other in interesting, startlingly realistic ways. Celine Song plays on a very specific feeling of aching; for a forgotten time in one's life, for an identity, or for a lover. It's particular, but looking around the audience as we left the theater, you could see that most people were in their own heads, thinking of something (or someone). We all long for something lost.Perhaps not all of us, but probably most, have also wrestled with the feeling of permanence in the journey we choose for ourselves. You only live once, said Drake, but that's really a terrifying thought sometimes. Carving out one lifetime - engineered across thousands of individual decisions - means foregoing an infinite number of others. People deal with this in a number of ways; providence, reincarnation, and an afterlife, to name a few. Nora and Hae Sung might be soulmates, but will they know it in this lifetime, or the next?I really can't wait for the next project Song works on, and that goes double for the cast. I sunk my teeth into this deeply romantic, deeply resonant film, which is capable of bringing immense longing to the surface. It is coated with a beautiful score and draped atop memorable settings. It's a home-run.9/10 for making me want to visit Seoul.~aweynand96 rated 9/10 on 7 July 2023"

I always found her hilarious in real life - in interviews, segments, etc, and found her to have a down to earth comedic personality, so it's about time she was her true self in a film. The story itself is nothing we haven't seen before, but all casting and performances were spot on, as was the directing, cinematography and score. The pacing was perfect in that the 103 min runtime flew by. There were many laugh out loud moments, especially from Lawrence's antics, and that's what made this film that much more enjoyable. In addition to the comedy, there are some heart warming moments that added that extra touch to this film.

Andrew Barth Feldman is also great, his awkwardness never becomes annoying, instead its always endearing and funny.Gene Stupnitsky's direction is really good, making sure the central premise never gets uncomfortable in undesired ways, adding some clever inversions for a few memorable jokes and keeping the film light on its feet thanks to a couple of montages as well.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 23 June 2023"," A refreshing and worthwhile addition to the comedy genre: My wife and I recently watched No Hard Feelings (2023) on Netflix.

Luckily, she stumbles upon an intriguing offer - a new car in exchange for a rendezvous with a young man before he heads off to college.

It boasts impressive depth and clever subplots. The acting is exceptional, with the cast nailing their characters in terms of personality, mannerisms, and dialogue. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a standout comedic performance that kept me grinning throughout.

This kind of genre which they hardly release in cinemas anymore.Apparently its based on a craiglist ad which means that the story is not outlandish, the ad actually happened in real life ! Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie.very funny and its nice to see Jennifer Lawrence show off her comedic chops.I think the age gap is not a big deal at all. They have been making films with way older men and way younger women since Hollywood existed so why is it a problem that the women is older? They both have great chemistry !

They want him laid and gain life confidence. They hire Maddie to have sex with him in exchange for an used car.JLaw has some comedic skills. She's better than most actresses in doing broad comedy although she is not strictly a comedian. There is a difference in what she can do. During the naked fight, I am reminded of Jason Segel in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I laughed at Jason's doughy pathetic nakedness. JLaw is neither doughy nor pathetic. That scene is not sexy and it's not comedic either. It exists in a middle ground of awkwardness. The sex part of the story is awkward. They need to pick a lane. She is either a romantic partner or platonic friend. JLaw can do funny slapstick and that's one of her bigger strengths. The characters do have great heart and at its best, this movie has some of the Harold and Maude magic. All in all, it's an enjoyable comedy.~SnoopyStyle rated 7/10 on 13 August 2023"," Far better than most romcoms - actually funny: However, the film loses steam in the last 30-40 minutes because it becomes a lot more serious. There are still some jokes and many are funny at that part of the film. But the tonal shift of the movie felt a little jarring.It also is incredibly sweet and not really cheesy. Only a repeat of a gag earlier in the last 10 minutes of the movie seemed a bit cheesy.Jennifer Lawrence needs to do more comedies though. She has a ton of charisma for romcoms.As a guy, I haven't liked many romcoms, but this one was far more modern compared to those 90's and 2000's ones. Trainwreck was another pretty funny movie to me as well.~tgrock rated 8/10 on 18 June 2023"," Surprisingly worthwhile, though something being good with Jennifer Lawrence in it isn't surprising at all.: No Hard Feelings is a feel good film, the character's relationship akin to the recent 2017 ""The Babysitter"" film. Where the bond remains even though the initial intentions aren't on the up and up. Despite Jennifer Lawrence making the film what it is, the highlight's Percy playing and singing ""Maneater"" to Maddie, as well the other occupants of the restaurant. It really encapsulates the entirety of the film and the wall he broke through, a teary eye moment for sure. It was nicely setup, which is good writing. I suspect this is why and only why Lawrence would take such a role, I find most of the responses to the film here pretty juvenile. The comedy's somewhat hit and miss though.~bombersflyup rated 9/10 on 11 August 2023"," Decently funny but nothing particularly special: No Hard Feelings is a pretty entertaining but unspectacular comedy. It will be sure to produce some good laughs, but the story is a little too paper thin and the characters a little too 2-dimensional for it to truly impress.It follows Jennifer Lawrence as 32 year old Maddie, who finds herself embroiled in a scheme to save her house by 'dating' a 19 year old at the behest of his parents.It's not the worst set up I've ever seen in a comedy, but it's not great either. Saying this, it does allow for plenty of comedic scenarios and is actually a pretty funny film, with numerous laugh out loud moments.As well as being funny it boasts two brilliant lead performances. Jennifer Lawrence is always brilliant so it's no surprise that she steals the show. I'd never even heard of Andrew Barth Feldman before, but he really shines in his role and plays it to perfection. The supporting cast is minimal, so it really is all about the two terrific performances from these two.My real gripe is with the plot. I don't think the emotional elements resonated as the characters are too poorly fleshed out. When the film gets bogged down in the emotional beat it slows down the pacing too much. I just didn't find myself getting invested in any of the characters, the outcome of the story (mostly because it was very predictable), or the emotional journey of it all.If you're looking for a late night comedy that will be sure to get you laughing, No Hard Feelings should do the trick. I highly doubt it will go down as a classic of the genre, but it does its job well enough.~ethanbresnett rated 6/10 on 23 June 2023"," Mildly enjoyable until it becomes really dumb: This movie instantly sold me on ""From the director of Good Boys."" I adore that movie. It's hysterical. No Hard Feelings has a similar tone and type of comedy. It's the kind that never feels like it's holding back. And the R-rating means it doesn't have to play it safe, which is awesome.For most of the movie, I was enjoying it. The premise is amusing and it's entertaining overall. But I didn't find it nearly as funny as Good Boys. And it leans much more heavily on the drama side, especially late in the movie when the comedic attempts are scarce.But the biggest downside is a few jaw-droppingly dumb moments during the last act. It swung my score from a mildly positive 6 to a mediocre 5. I didn't mind watching it, but I've seen much better. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 6/22/2023)~FeastMode rated 5/10 on 23 June 2023"," Great Comedy, Unexpectedly Sweet: This movie definitely met me and my friend group's expectations for comedy, our whole theater practically laughed out loud every few minutes. Jennifer's comedic timing is something I hope we get to see more of on the big screen. An amazing actor as always. The tonal shift to a more serious story in the last half might catch some off guard, but I think it added some realism and depth to the plot. More than that though, the best comedies still have a message and core of serious as light it may be with that shiny happy ending. I really enjoyed this movie and had fun in a theater for the first time in a while.~Avalala rated 8/10 on 24 June 2023"
The Sound of Music (1965) - IMDb,8.1,Julie Andrews|Christopher Plummer|Eleanor Parker|Richard Haydn|Peggy Wood|Charmian Carr|Heather Menzies-Urich|Nicholas Hammond|Duane Chase|Angela Cartwright|Debbie Turner|Kym Karath|Anna Lee|Portia Nelson|Ben Wright|Daniel Truhitte|Norma Varden|Gilchrist Stuart,Robert Wise,Georg Hurdalek|Howard Lindsay|Russel Crouse,A young novice is sent by her convent in 1930s Austria to become a governess to the seven children of a widowed naval officer.," Pure cinematic magic, won Best Picture of the Year and rightfully so!: Capitalizing on two ""hot"" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs ""Do Re Mi"" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and ""The Lonely Goatherd"", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; ""My Favorite Things"" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) ""Maria"", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""So Long, Farewell"", especially little Kym Karath's ""goodbye"" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder ""when will it end?"". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned ""Do Re Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line ""Him?!"", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the ""dueling"" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the ""I Have Confidence"" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!~jacobs-greenwood rated 10/10 on 11 December 2016"," Fantastic family friendly musical classic: The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.~davispittman rated 10/10 on 26 October 2017"," Just a classic that will never get old: Song and dance is definitely not my thing. However I've seen this movie dozens and dozens of times overs the years. It never gets old... if you have never seen it it's well worth your time. They just don't make them like this anymore. Rent it or buy it, a true classic that is perfect from start to finish...~brett-76260 rated 10/10 on 28 April 2018"," Would you even want to solve a problem like Maria? She's wonderful!: Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing ""Few Favorite Things"" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song ""Something Good."" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the ""glories"" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably ""Confidence in Me"", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 23 February 2005"," The Sights & Sounds of The Sound Of Music: *** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,""What Best Picutre winner should I choose for a review?"" Many to choose from of course.The answer came to me when I chose to & replayedthis wonderful film since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the, now grown, child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion.Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid, it usually is the first ""Best Picture"" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life, without even knowing it.When you see it the first time, the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot, you know it's going to be something great.Like many kids, it was only natural I'd like songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""So Long, Farewell"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" (or ""The Yodeling Song"" as some call it) and more. I liked ""Edelweiss"" and ""Climb Every Mountain"" but not until when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and ""Mary Poppins"" and other movies, where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then.Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible, then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive, fair and loving and (of course) singing.Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship.That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert, chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music, as we know, was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories.That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even now .Lastly, because the people behind the scenes, as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves, made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie, well doneSounds like ten stars, for all time.

I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: ""It makes you feel alive"" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.~duffjerroldorg rated 10/10 on 12 April 2017"," When you need a pick me up, nothing comes close to this one.: Seven children are lucky enough to receive the glorious Maria as their new nanny.The Sound of Music is definitely one of the greatest musicals of all time. Even the hardest hearted cynics, like myself, who aren't generally fans of musicals, cannot help but be wrapped in the charms of this film.It's almost three hours long, but it's never dull, it never feels long winded or boring. It is genuinely just the most lovely, uplifting, positive movies of all time, even to this day it still manages to captivate. Sometimes you just need something sweet and comforting, this film is like a warm woolen blanket on an icy cold day.Julie Christie actually won the Oscar that year for her role in Darling, and great though she was, I think many would say that Julie Andrews truly deserved the award for this enchanting, memorable performance. Christie's singing is enchanting.Fortunately the film did actually win the oscar for best movie, and rightly so. This film will never ever lose its charm.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 June 2023"," How do you solve a problem like Maria?: I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 2 April 2009"," The perfect film musical......: This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as ""Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?"" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, ""If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you."" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (""Seven Brides..."", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""...Molly Brown"", ""The Music Man"", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of ""The Sound of Music"". The film has it all.~Poseidon-3 rated NA on 29 April 2002"," Hollywood's Last Great Musical: ""The Sound of Music"" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 28 October 2000"

Then Priscilla, leaves her life behind to be part of Elvis's life and live it the way he wants her to. The cheating, mistreatment and complete disregard for her feeling eventually pushes her to realize that she has her own identity and it is not worth living somebody else's life. The film documents their life together till their divorce.Having watched Elvis the movie and totally enjoying it to the core, it was hard to buy into this Bad Elvis. Thanks to the performances especially by Cailee Spaeny, I was able to stay with the narrative till the end. This had a serious narrative and it wasn't an easy watch. As it only documents the years from the moment Priscilla meets Elvis and them living together, only to end up in a marriage which parts them enough to give Priscilla enough courage to seek divorce.Once again it was a powerful performance by Cailee and kudos to Sofia Coppola to get such a performance from her and to have that control over the narrative, which successfully portrays the emotional journey of Priscilla. From being a naive teen who is hopelessly in love, despite being ill treated to finally grow up enough to figure out what needs to be done. The pace is slow and like I said, it is not an easy watch.~chand-suhas rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Sofia Coppola's mood piece on Elvis & Priscilla: Early in Sofia Coppola's languid distillation of Priscilla Presley's life with Elvis, she receives a beautifully coiffed and presented gift of a pet poodle. Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) had recently moved into Graceland when she gets the present. 14 when they met in Germany, Priscilla was still only 17. She coddles the pooch and treats it like a little princess. Coppola (who wrote the screenplay adapted from Priscilla's book) makes a case that Elvis (Jacob Elordi) viewed his then future wife as a type of possession. When the teenager asks for permission to take a part-time job, the musician forbades it saying that he needs her to be available whenever he desires. Like the dog, Priscilla is always to be primped and pampered to its owner's specifications.One could say that PRISCILLA represents the other side of Baz Luhrman's recent phantasmagorical film ELVIS in both style and POV. That's certainly true in many ways, but it's doubtful that Coppola would have made her movie much differently even if Luhrman's film didn't exist. Phillipe La Sourd's cinematography, Tamara Deverell's Production Design and Stacey Battat's costuming all fit nicely within Coppola's aesthetic. The filmmaker's love of pop music is also fully on display with period songs mixed freely with more recent tunes in a similar vein (the movie begins with The Ramones and fades out with Dolly Parton).Coppola has rarely been an auteur interested in pure plot and narrative drive. She prefers to soak the viewer into the milieu of her characters. On that level, PRISCILLA has a certain effectiveness. Neither Spaeny nor Elordi are stars, but, their anonymity adds to their relatability. Elordi in particular, faces not only comparisons to Austin Butler's ebullient Oscar nominated performance, but decades of imitators. He humanizes the mythic figure even if, at a certain point, his lack of flash reduces the King of Rock 'N Roll to too much the mere mortal. The elephant in the room is, of course, that Elvis would be considered persona non grata in today's climate. When Priscilla first enters Graceland, Elvis' ever-present entourage are taken aback at how young she looks. Coppola exaggerates the difference by casting actors over a foot apart in height (the real difference was closer to 8""). It does make her look like a little girl (and Spaeny convincingly pulls it off despite being only a year younger than Elordi; Elvis was a decade Priscilla's senior). In Coppola (and Priscilla's) telling, Elvis isn't portrayed as making his young wife into a purely sexual object. He kept her under glass in his misguided notion that he was protecting her. To make her into an idealized good Christian girl and modern Southern belle who his recently deceased mama could have been proud of. It's an extraordinary tricky balance - particularly with the real Priscilla being a Producer on this film.By design, PRISCILLA never takes a truly deep look at all the details of the couple's lives. Colonel Tom Parker is only vaguely alluded to. The viewer sees Elvis performing only near the very end, and briefly. Once at Graceland, Priscilla is barely shown with anyone other than Elvis' posse. The movie only spans the years they were together. It's a very insular movie which relies heavily on mood and atmosphere. It will be up to each individual viewer if that is sufficient.~gortx rated NA on 9 November 2023"," Almost one of Coppola's best; Spaeny is an immediate star: Priscilla is absorbing material told with a quiet confidence; like Marie Antoinette, for at least two thirds of the way in, this feels like it is so close to being one of this director's most Formally and performance-wise impressive and inspired films. Whether you sense any deeper personal connection Coppola may have had with the story (Id need a psychology degree to unpack what it may or may not be like for this director to have been so close to a figure like Francis Coppola, though a much different context), the film largely works as a story where you get not only why a young woman would fall for this man at this time, but why it would be so hard to leave when it gets... rough.When it's Priscilla in her high school years, in total yet totally understandable infatuation with Elvis (that time period when he goes away and she counts the months by calendar, chefs kiss), and even into most of the time into Graceland, it's engrossing. The flaw is when it kept going after running out of things to say; in that sense, ironically given how they are so wholly tonally different films, this has the same problem as Luhrmann's Elvis where it covers so much ground that it runs out of steam dramatically (the Hit The Points We Know sort of thing). If you asked me which is the superior film I'll say Coppola's, but it's not by a long shot exactly, just with different strengths for each.Still, Spaeny gives, along with Dominic Sessa in The Holdovers, the OMG where did *that* come from Young actor turn of the year, as well as Elordi being ideally cast as *this* Elvis, and even with my qualms I would say to anyone vaguely interested to check it out. It's the kind of storytelling where the physical details are so impactful - watch what Priscilla does just before she goes to the hospital to give birth to her daughter, not subtle but a devastating fine-underlined point about her life as it was - and as per Coppola the production design and costuming and the camerawork is fantastic (though it took me a few minutes to adjust to how dark some of the scenes are lit).And I must also add, other mostly splendid music choices besides (sampling from 80s New Wave to Santana), the opening needle drop (""Baby, I Love You,"" by The Ramones via Phil Spector) is as nerve-tingling as the final one is tacky (I'll leave you to be the judge, but I kind of groaned at that forced romantic irony).PS: that moment when Priscilla breaks down and tells Elvis to stop reading from that book is one of my two or three favorite moments from any film this year.~Quinoa1984 rated 8/10 on 5 November 2023"," Expected more: Priscilla takes the spotlight instead of Elvis in this one. It had that retro aesthetic, but it was portrayed differently from the 50s/60s in Baz Luhrmann's 'Elvis.' This film had a more understated, even slightly gloomy vibe in comparison. Andrew just like the visuals, we get a quieter look at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla, told from her perspective.The soundtrack is nice, you don't hear much of Presley's music. Unlike last year's Elvis biopic, this one doesn't cover an entire career; it's solely focused on their marriage. It feels like we spend a significant amount of time watching how they met, but the later years felt like we were skipping stuff. Priscilla seems isolated and controlled by Elvis, whose presence is distant in the movie. The first part of the movie feels like we're sitting through Priscilla's memories, but the last half feels like we're skimming through them.It's hard not to compare them, but Austin Butler's portrayal of Elvis is better than Jacob Elordi's; Butler's performance is almost iconic. Jacob's fine, I just think there was a disconnect between Jacob's speaking voice and his singing voice. The age difference between Elvis and Priscilla is depicted better here, more creepily, mainly due to the innocence Cailee Spaeny conveys, emphasized further by the height difference.There isn't much chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla depicted in this film. Maybe it's how it was in reality and how it's depicted, but it seems like they fell in love over small talk, like ""hey, I miss home,"" ""hey, I like talking to you,"" and then it jumps to the abusive, controlling part of their relationship filled with arguments. Intimacy over small talk.I do think Cailee Spaeny did a great job as Priscilla. You can always tell how she feels, and the movie doesn't need to explicitly state ""oh, she's sad"" for you to understand. We witness the transformation of Priscilla over the years, and Spaeny flawlessly captures the journey from an innocent young fan to a frustrated woman trapped in a controlling and isolating relationship, culminating in her portrayal of a grown woman who had had enough of Elvis' behavior.Honestly, the film isn't particularly special, especially considering the visually epic story we got from the 2021 Elvis movie. I thought it would bring something different or offer deeper insights, especially since it's a well-known story and was recently told on the big screen. But it doesn't feel deeply felt or ravishingly detailed as described.Vegas backdrop looked so fake, like not even cgi, more like when they build small miniature towns and shoot those. Movie's Anticlimactic too.Certain aspects of her life are teased, like her affair with the instructor, which seems essential to the story but is only hinted at. It goes back to how the last years of their marriage are depicted, making it feel like we're skimming through memories instead of experiencing them. Maybe it was just to keep her innocence.It's a story that's already famous, so I expected this film to bring a unique and possibly deeper perspective, but it doesn't offer anything that isn't already known. It feels like it missed the mark and turned out mediocre, uninteresting, and somewhat forgettable for me.~AfricanBro rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," What did these two ever see in each other?: It's a biopic of the relationship between Priscilla Beaulieu and Elvis Presley between 1959 and 1972 in West Germany, Memphis, Tennessee, Las Vegas, and California.In 1959, Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) is the 14-year-old daughter of Ann (Dagmara Dominczyk) and her stepfather, Paul (Ari Cohen), a career military man. The family has recently been posted in West Germany, and Priscilla is lonely. 24-year-old Elvis Presley (Jacob Elordi) is serving his military time in Germany. His friend, Terry West (Luke Humphrey), notices Priscilla in a restaurant and asks if she wants to meet Elvis. Of course, she does, and her parents reluctantly allow them to meet.Elvis appears to fall for Priscilla, and they date for about six months until Elvis's tour of duty is complete, and he returns to the United States to resume his career. Three years later, in 1963, Elvis reconnects with Priscilla and invites her for a visit to Graceland. Her parents reluctantly agree. The film then follows the evolution of their relationship, including the fact that they lived together almost immediately, even as she was finishing grade 12 at a Catholic school. They finally marry in 1967, but the relationship continues downhill almost immediately.There are no good guys in this movie. Priscilla is the victim of a significant power imbalance; her primary role is to encourage the insecure ego of Elvis, who constantly needs to be surrounded by an entourage of fawning sycophants, and who introduces 17-year-old Priscilla to drugs on her first visit to Elvis in 1963. On the other hand, the movie portrays little genuine chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla except for pointless entertainment. They proclaim love for each other, but there never seems to be any depth to the relationship. And the music that shaped Elvis Presley is almost entirely absent.Cailee Spaeny does an excellent job with a mediocre story. Jacob Elordi mumbled enough to miss some of the dialogue. No one else has a personality.~steiner-sam rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," Return to Sender: I saw ""Priscilla"" yesterday. ""Priscilla"" is a 2023 American biographical drama film written, directed, and produced by Sofia Coppola, based on the 1985 memoir ""Elvis and Me"" by Priscilla Presley (who served as an executive producer) and Sandra Harmon. It stars Cailee Spaeny in the titular role and Jacob Elordi as Elvis Presley. I looked forward to seeing this film based on the rave reviews it has received. However, I must say that I was disappointed by the film. Some critics say that the movie was ""understated"" - that is an understatement! I found it to be tedious and slow. I just couldn't get invested in Cailee Spaeny's performance - it didn't grab me as authentic. She has limited range as actress - which seems to be all the way from A to B. Jacob Elordi is strikingly handsome (as Elvis was) but he doesn't seem right for the role - he is 6' 5"" and Elvis was 5' 11""! More importantly, his performance is annoying, especially when he mumbles (of course, he could be a victim of Coppola's script and direction). Speaking of writing and direction, Coppola speeds through parts of Priscilla's life towards the end whereas she spends too much in the initial buildup to the marriage. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film. As Elvis sang - ""return to sender"". 4/10.~dlmiley rated 4/10 on 1 December 2023"," Uncomfortable reality coupled with a one-dimensional narrative: Wow, this was an uncomfortable movie to watch. Priscilla invites inevitable comparisons to last year's ""Elvis,"" portraying an exact opposite narrative. Helmed by the talented Sophia Coppola, who commands great respect, and featuring Jacob Elordi, an actor I admire, the film falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, it presents a one-dimensional, flat perspective that left me somewhat disappointed.While the performances are strong, and the direction commendable, Priscilla's narrative feels tedious and slow at times. The harrowing depiction of power imbalances in the central relationship adds a layer of discomfort that makes the film hard to watch. Sophia Coppola's artistic choices unveil a side of the characters that, while impactful, renders the viewing experience challenging. Priscilla sheds light on the vulnerability of a young protagonist, emphasizing the discomfort of witnessing a story where she is just a child.~cutie7 rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Torturous, monotonous and melancholy: Discussing the loss of some brain cells while watching the film ""Priscilla"" is quite an accurate description. I had initially been eager to watch it due to my affinity for period pieces, especially those that depict real historical figures. However, this film proved to be an exercise in complete frustration within the first 15 minutes. It began with an excruciatingly slow pace, followed by a moody atmosphere that failed to captivate in a compelling manner. To make matters worse, it rapidly devolved into an incomprehensible and unpleasant production that relied on numerous quick cuts with reckless abandon.""Priscilla"" made the unfortunate decision to hop between different time periods without delving into any of the characters in a meaningful way. None of them received the development they deserved, including the title character, Priscilla. What was particularly glaring was Sophia Coppola, who directed and wrote the script. Her portrayal of Elvis was nothing short of brutal, depicting him as a mumbling, shy individual with multiple personalities, a serial cheater, bad-tempered, controlling, sexually dysfunctional, stunted in his emotional development, and plagued by a Madonna Complex.No wonder right before she passed away, Lisa Marie Presley hated everything about this script and also thought that it was akin to being a hatchet-job. I'm beginning to have some questions about Priscilla Pressley. She's been involved in too many controversies regarding her daughter, grand-daughter, Elvis and that estate. Just sayin'.First and foremost, it's hard to fathom how a parent could permit a 14-year-old to associate with, and secretly date, a man 10 years older. Even more bewildering is the decision to let her relocate back to the United States, considering her father was stationed in Germany at the time, and reside at his estate. The only explanation that seems plausible is the overpowering influence of money. Given Elvis's wealth and fame, it appears that these factors overshadowed any morality her parents may have had.The film portrays Priscilla as a pampered and privileged young girl, essentially held captive within the opulent confines of Graceland. In one scene, she expresses her desire to secure a job while attending school, telling Elvis it would be fun. However, Elvis dismisses this idea by presenting her with an ultimatum: him or a career, all while he's away filming and allegedly screwing his leading ladies.Do any of us know if all of this is completely true...no, except the fact that her parents did hand her over to Elvis while she was underage. What we also know is that a child shouldn't be living with an adult man like this, and scenes like the one I described, without any context before enduring yet another quick cut time jump, is one of the many things that made this film extremely unbearable.Also, Coppola rushing through years of multiple betrayals, sadness and pleasure at a breakneck pace, made the film feel as if she was trying to check all of the boxes on her ridiculous timeline, rather than fully immersing us in Priscilla's early life and experiences with Elvis.Now let's get to the casting. Jacob Elordi as Elvis didn't strike me as authentic. There wasn't enough suspension of disbelief in the world to buy him as the titular 50s/60s heartthrob. The difference between his Elvis and Austin Butler's Elvis is simple: Elordi played Elvis and Butler became Elvis. That's what made Butler's portrayal more believable and real. Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley was serviceable, though a bit stiff. She had 2 expressions in this film...wide-eyed, young and naive and sullen. That was about it. Even when it cut to her leaving Elvis after his Vegas show, there was nothing for the audience to get excited about. And by no means are either of these performances award-worthy, no matter what the Hollywood PR machine is spinning.In case you might be thinking about Col. Tom Parker, he never appeared in this film. You just heard Elvis on the phone with him. Even Priscilla's parents were in it sporadically. Elvis' mother was already dead and his father popped in and out with his now wife or girlfriend, that too wasn't fully explained. His grandmother, Black housekeeper and his so-called ""memphis mafia"" were seen here and there.""Priscilla"" is a torturous, monotonous and melancholy story surrounding the relationship between Priscilla and Elvis....nothing more than that. It had the potential to be a seering and engrossing film because all of the elements were there, but the ball was badly dropped and much to this film's detriment, no one took the time to find it.I usually like Sophia Coppola's films, with the exception of that abysmal ""The Beguiled"", and I'm sure I'll end up in the minority with my take about this film, but none of it worked for me. From the beginning to the end, I kept wondering what in the Hell am I watching???~syd9907 rated 1/10 on 8 November 2023"," Bland and boring: How can they make such an interesting story into such an uniteresting movie? Well, that's a good question.Some of the reasons as follows.No chemistry. No emotions. No sensuality or sex. Nothing interesting happens. No new insights. No real suspense, tension, happiness, joy or emotions. Just actors trying to act without any real feeling getting through to the viewer.And the actor that plays Elvis are to tall for the role. He doesn't come through as someone that millions of girls and guys would love. And what about the music? Just a collection of songs that have no relation to Elvis.Nope, this is just a bland and boring try to tell the Priscilla - Elvis story, without actually telling us more than a short written article could do as good, or bad.~petercarlsson-92297 rated 1/10 on 16 December 2023"," keep the home fires burning: Greetings again from the darkness. It was less than 18 months ago when Baz Luhrman's Oscar nominated ELVIS hit theaters and we were admiring Austin Butler's performance. Where that movie was glitzy and loud and centered on Elvis and Col Tom Parker, this current film from writer-director Sofia Coppola (Oscar winner for LOST IN TRANSLATION, 2003) offers a quieter, more intimate glimpse at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla through her eyes.Ms. Coppola is a detailed filmmaker who excels when dealing with personal isolation, and Priscilla makes a fitting and worthy subject. The screenplay by Coppola and Sandra Harmon is adapted from Priscilla Presley's 1985 memoir, ""Elvis and Me"", a book that also served as the basis for the 1988 TV movie of the same name (screenplay by Ms. Harmon). Although Elvis Presley Enterprises was not involved with this film (explaining the lack of familiar Elvis music), Priscilla Presley did serve as Executive Producer (EP, ironically), so her memories and preferences likely play a key role in much of what we see here.Relative newcomer Cailee Spaeny (""Mare of Easttown"") delivers an outstanding performance - from 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu in 1959 to Elvis's bride in 1967 through their divorce in 1973. Ms. Spaeny perfectly captures the wide-eyed innocence of a young fan, the frustrations of a young woman being controlled and isolated, and finally, a grown woman standing up for her own freedom. Playing Elvis through this same time period is Jacob Elordi (""Euphoria""), and he is effective in mimicking the familiar mannerisms and speaking voice. Physically, he towers over the diminutive Spaeny, which although not historically accurate, does add a dimension to the couple's disconnect. As for the age difference, the two actors are close in age, but are able to portray the actual 10 year age gap between Elvis and Priscilla.The creep factor is ever-present as 24-year-old Elvis, overseas on military duty, shows an elevated interest in 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, whose military father is also stationed in Germany. The naivety of their first meetings is captured as Elvis' beloved mother has recently passed away. Both are lonely and away from home, and Elvis simply finds her easy to talk to. It's hindsight to question how parents could allow the situation to escalate, but anyone who has parented a teenager understands the challenges. When Priscilla turns 17, she moves into Graceland, yet Elvis insists the intimacy wait until after they are married.At the core of the story is Priscilla's solitude and loneliness. She is confined to Graceland and requested to ""keep the home fires burning"" as Elvis marches off to the stream of movies set up by a never-seen-here Col Tom Parker. Keeping Parker on the phone allows Priscilla's world to remain even smaller despite being married to the biggest star on the planet. Doses of Elvis and the Memphis Mafia occur between extended stretches alone with Elvis' grandmother and personal cook. She is isolated from the real world and clearly controlled by Elvis, who was only partially present.When Priscilla and Elvis are together, the strain is apparent. Prescription drugs and sexual tension are interrupted by periodic bursts of Elvis anger, followed by a sincere apology. It's here where we realize he's more of a kid than she is ... emotionally stunted in what makes a relationship (it takes more than the tabloid reports of movie set flings Priscilla reads about). This is also evident as she watches him go through many phases in search of himself - martial arts, bible study, eastern philosophy, etc. In the family photo shoot with Lisa Marie, body language tells the whole story. Priscilla's fling with karate instructor Mike Stone is teased, but not dwelled upon. We realize that Priscilla was the one thing in life he felt he could control. By the end, one of them has escaped the cage, while the other remains captive.Voted 'Best Film' at this year's Venice Film Festival, it also reminds us what a terrific filmmaker Sofia Coppola can be. Working with a limited budget, she and her team are so proficient, it never seems as if they cut corners. Cinematographer Philipe Le Sourd and Editor Sarah Flack manage to sustain the pacing despite an inordinate amount of time Priscilla spends on her own at Graceland. Production Designer Tamara Deverell recreated the recognizable interior of Graceland, while the work of Costume Designer Stacey Battat guides us through the fashion changes that occurred over these 14 years. The film recreates some of the iconic images and moments that are ingrained in our memory banks, and director Coppola chooses to end with Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"", supposedly the song Elvis sang to Priscilla as they finalized the divorce.Opens in theaters on November 3, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 2 November 2023"

Yet his films are not just aesthetically engaging; they tend to be hilarious and well-written in a quirky, down-to-earth way. As a fan of his work, I was looking forward to ""Asteroid City."" This retro sci-fi tale of a UFO/alien sighting in a 1950s desert town certainly delivers Anderson's expected vibes, but fails to pair the visuals and auteurist elements with an engaging, emotionally impactful plot or character development that is equally strong and/or effective.The film is a true ensemble piece, and doesn't have a clear main character. This would be fine if the wide array of characters involved were more compellingly written, but the screenplay treats their motivations as simply second fiddle to ""style,"" world-building, and more abstract themes. Thematically, the film also seems a bit inert, seeming to jump around in subtext without providing the plot context to justify it--including through the framing device of a play. Anderson's large ensemble cast generally does pretty well with the material they are given, but their actions feel removed from consequence or plot relevance to make us feel a lot fo their characters. The brilliant craftsmanship on display mildly offsets these concerns--from the outstanding production design, cinematography, costume design, and editing--which are well-done even by Wes Anderson's standards. Yet the lack of a comparatively developed plot or character motivations is a bit jarring compared to his better films, such as ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" ""The Royal Tenebaums,"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Even the anthology structure in ""The French Dispatch"" felt more character-driven and authentic, and thus more conceptually engaging than this film. Make no mistake, Anderson is and has always been a creative visionary, and his fans should generally have a good time while watching this film. It's just a little bit unfortunate that the film comes off as more hollow and forgettable than it should, despite plenty of positive qualities as well. Recommended only to Wes Anderson fans. 6.5/10.~bastille-852-731547 rated 6/10 on 13 June 2023"," Packed to the Rafters with Nothing of Note: It is hard to think of a movie as underwhelming or as twee as Wes Anderson's 'Asteroid City,' a meandering, grandiose comic-drama as overlong as it is overindulgent. As it begins, we are told the film is in fact a televised production of a play by a fellow named Conrad Earp, which follows a ragtag bunch of misfits who gather on the isolated titular town to partake in a science convention. Among them is recent widower and war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck, who hits it off with noted actress Midge Campbell. Meanwhile, the actor playing Augie has doubts about his performance, and fears he doesn't understand the play.A fear shared by this viewer. 'Asteroid City' is a film packed to the rafters with nothing of note. The narrative is overloaded with unnecessary stylizations that distract rather than engage. Moreover, the switching back and forth between the play and the show about it is jarring throughout, while the overarching structure is alienating. It is difficult to immerse oneself in the world of the film as one is constantly reminded it is fiction. Similarly, it is no easy task connecting with the characters when the film they're in keeps telling us that they and their conflicts are imaginary.Additionally, Anderson doesn't fully explore any of the innumerable story threads he begins to unravel, nor does he properly develop his themes, whether they be about reality and fiction, the role of science and technology or the search for identity and belonging. He introduces thematic ideas in a superficial and inconsistent way, without giving them enough depth or resolution. This makes the film feel unfocused and incomplete, as it leaves the viewer with many questions and loose ends.For instance, he introduces the idea of a nuclear war looming over Asteroid City, but doesn't explore its implications or consequences for the characters or the world. He also introduces the character of Conrad Earp, the playwright behind it all, but never explains his motivations or his relationship with the actors or the audience. Moreover, he fails to conclude any of the various subplots in a meaningful or coherent way, seeming to prefer endlessly switching between different levels of artifice in a vacuum of self-satisfaction.Furthermore, the characters are all Anderson stereotypes dialled up to the max. We've seen the quirky neurotic Steenbeck before in projects like 'Rushmore' and 'Darjeeling Limited', while Campbell is essentially just Margot Tenenbaum with better hair, or any number of the beautiful, aloof ladies Anderson has given the world over the years. Each and all eccentric and mannered, the people that populate 'Asteroid City' feel like they were created by artificial intelligence trying to emulate Anderson's earlier, better movies.Likewise, the dialogue is your typical Anderson fare, full of cutesy phrases and obscure references that'll make grey-haired hipsters chuckle; though is a different breed from the likes of, say, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.' For all its faults, that film had plenty of rapid-pace witticisms and verbal sparring matches, which 'Asteroid City' has a dearth of. The dialogue is largely uninspired and inane, when it isn't contrived and artificial, as it is whenever Steenbeck's son has to converse with anyone, or when Steenbeck and Campbell share their woes through their windows.Narratively, 'Asteroid City' isolates and irritates, while Robert Yeoman's striking cinematography is cartoonish and extravagant. Yeoman makes use of bright colours, symmetrical compositions and retro-futuristic props and costumes to create a distinctive, whimsical aesthetic that reflects Anderson's trademark visual style. The attention to detail on display is laudable, while the intricacy of the sets and staging is staggering. However, Yeoman's work also contributes to the tacky artificiality and lack of subtlety of proceedings, meaning that, instead of enhancing the mood or meaning of the film, his exaggerated stylizations serve only to distract. Additionally, the score-a jumbled mixture of 50's country songs and synthetic pop- is as forgettable and bland as saltless porridge.Though Anderson has assembled a truly awesome all-star cast, nobody is giving anything particularly interesting or challenging to do. Though Jason Schwartzman does strong work as the quirky, self-absorbed neurotic Augie Steenbeck, it's a role he's played dozens of times before in better projects and to greater effect. Similarly, Scarlett Johansson impresses as the austere Midge Campbell, showing her vulnerability in a way most nuanced and affecting; though is underutilised and ultimately reduced to a mere plot device.Additionally, Bryan Cranston does a half-decent Rod Serling impression as the narrator of the piece and Tom Hanks brings pathos and power to his all too small role as Steenbeck's father-in-law, though both characters are woefully one-dimensional. Also worthy of note is Jeffrey Wright, who's consistently amusing as a caricature of an army general, and Tilda Swinton, who engages in more of the jittery over-acting that has endeared her to so many. The rest of the cavalcade of stars are generally commendable, but have little to do in the face of Anderson's scant characterisation and unengaging narrative.In conclusion, 'Asteroid City,' like 'The French Dispatch' before it, is very much a case of style over substance. Anderson's best films- perhaps tellingly all written alongside Owen Wilson- have heart and soul to match their kooky characters and painstakingly intricate visuals. 'Asteroid City' is a heartless, soulless exercise in pretension; a meandering mess of a motion picture. Though it boasts some fine performances, there's very little on offer in 'Asteroid City;' and it's certainly not a place you'd want to call home.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 4/10 on 16 August 2023"," He has out-Wes-Anderson himself: Wes Anderson has always been a favorite director of mine. I have seen all his movies - but for me, the magic is gone.I feel like The Grand Budapest Hotel was his masterpiece. Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while. One of us really liked it though - but she had only seen 50% of a Wes Anderson film before. The rest of us felt... full.~mennivetvadjagmenar rated 5/10 on 12 June 2023", What's the point of this movie?: This film was a huge let down. It was absolutely boring. Nothing happens in the entire film aside from a UFO/ Alien sighting which was shown in the trailers.This film is categorized as a drama/comedy/ romance and it doesn't succeed in any of them. The drama is so minimal that it's easy to overlook. This film tries to be comedic but it is so dry. I can't recall a single moment where I laughed. The slight romance it has is elementary.This film had no life to it. There wasn't anything in it that made me look forward to the next scene. It tries to be creative with a dual storyline. One storyline is that of a play in which the audience is watching as a film. The other storyline is supposed to be the behind the scenes activities of the actors who are acting in the play. It is a bit confusing at first but more than anything it unnecessarily complicates the story. The continues back and forth between the storylines does not add anything to the film. The way the scenes were split into acts was rather distracting instead of adding to the experience.There are so many well known actors in this film and not one single actor is used in a way that delivers a worthy performance. There were just too many characters for no reason. None of the characters were developed. There were a few lines stating who each character was and only two or three had something minimally happen throughout the film.The Wes Anderson's style was somewhat present but not as much as in his other films. It does have a nice use of colors but even that could not help how much this movie lacked any context.What was the point of this film?~moviemanmo rated 1/10 on 23 June 2023," Unfunny and incomprehensible: When you talk about big movie stars like Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson or Bryan Cranston... people often say, ""I'll watch them in anything."" Well, Asteroid City puts that notion to the test.This is a movie that's weird even by Wes Anderson's standards. It actually feels more like a parody of a Wes Anderson movie. And not in a good way.I would describe it like this: It's a movie of a TV broadcast of a play about a play... and what we see is the movie version of the play within the play within the TV show (I think I have all of that right... it's all very confusing). What's missing in all of this is any real plot or characters to care about. It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I like Anderson's films, but I just didn't get this one.~jmoney-2 rated 1/10 on 1 July 2023"," Worst of his movies, such a waste for this amazing cast: This is by far the worst of his movies. Such an incredible cast and he did nothing with them, the acting is good but the lack of an interesting story is unbelievable. It's a pretty film, yes, but even visually, it's the least interesting from his work. French dispatch was his first strike, Asteroid city is his second, really hope there's not a third. Hope he hires a good writer or writers to help him with his next films. We know he can do art direction, photography, and a few funny bits, but he needs someone to help him with plots. Really, with such an amazing cast, to come up with this, is so so so sad. What a waste. Truly disappointed.~fangel-31778 rated 4/10 on 18 June 2023"," Unmitigated bore of a film: This was a total disappointment from the start. The entire conceit, that it is a film within a play within a film is completely without interest. It seems to be a formal exercise in how far one can push a metaphor to the point where it has lost any meaning.I found myself falling asleep to it at one point when all the characters, each one looking into the lens, emote their lines without any emotional commitment whatsoever. The only one who seems to have any desire to project an iota of emotion, Scarlett Johansson, does her best to keep her audience interested, but even her attempt falls flat.There are numerous A-list cameos that have no reason to exist except to lend credence to the Auteur that Mr. Anderson has become. His obsession with proclaiming his own superiority leaves most of the cast cold, and even the best efforts by Tom Hanks and Adrien Brody cannot redeem what little story there is.The actors simply phone in their performances, particularly Jason Schwartzman, oddly enough, portraying a widower who does not grieve in front of his mismatched children, none of whom seems to notice their missing mother. Kudoes go to the three little girls who portray his daughters (blonde and blue eyed?) but who handle their roles like pros.Not much can be said for the rest of the cast, all of whom show up and portray their cardboard characters as best as they can, and the entire thing is missing any kind of heart -- it lasts way too long and by the time we have reached the anti-climax, we feel cheated out of any kind of feeling whatsoever.~naq-1 rated 2/10 on 16 June 2023"," This cast doesn't deserve this script: Wes Anderson drummed up a magnificent cast.

The setting is magnificent and almost everything about this movie is perfect.Everything but the plot. If you like humor, you'll like this film. If you come for the visuals, you'll love this film.

Too much effort was spent in an attempt to seem clever, and not enough effort spent trying to be enjoyable.Occasional lines were enough to raise a slight chuckle, or an exhale of air, but they are much too few and far between in the vast stretches of emptiness.The impressive cast assembled don't do an awful job with what they've been given, but none of the characters have any depth whatsoever. Even if they were, there are far too many characters to form any kind of cohesion.It's quirky at best and painfully dull.~andyman789 rated 3/10 on 24 June 2023"," There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste,: I saw 'ASTEROID CITY' yesterday...and I have amixed feelings about it....As usual, stylistically very impressive, with strong emphasis on ensemble work of actors, as it's usually happens in Wes Anderson's movies.When movie is considered ensemble piece the pressure of a film success falls on the shoulders of the director. In a normal narrative film the protagonist and antagonist often take the burden of film success on themselves, hoping that the audience will emphasize with our lead characters and their character arc, to be immersed in the story during the full running time.There is a risk however if the audience doesn't connect with performances the status of leading man or a woman is in jeopardy, with producers in the future not wanting to green light another film with actors, which were unable to handle the ""weight"" of the movie.This is why plenty of actors like to work on movies which offer ensemble feel. They don't have to spend many months on filmset, instead they come for few days, shoot their scenes and can move on to the next project. If their performance didn't work they are always supported by other quality actors, so it doesn't ruin the whole film. In ether way Wes Anderson's style always comes on top, as actors who work with him understand the particular speed of lines delivery, as well as dryness of the dialog.Stylistically it's very much what we expect from Anderson. Cinematography is more interesting then usual with a strong emphasis on production and costumes design.

Monti|David DeLao|Mikandrew,Rose Glass,Rose Glass|Weronika Tofilska,"A romance fueled by ego, desire and the American Dream."," Enjoyable enough for Wes Anderson fans; but lacking in substance or impact: Few independent filmmakers have a style as unique and distinctive as Wes Anderson's, whose signature aesthetic is almost immediately recognizable upon watching one of his films. Yet his films are not just aesthetically engaging; they tend to be hilarious and well-written in a quirky, down-to-earth way. As a fan of his work, I was looking forward to ""Asteroid City."" This retro sci-fi tale of a UFO/alien sighting in a 1950s desert town certainly delivers Anderson's expected vibes, but fails to pair the visuals and auteurist elements with an engaging, emotionally impactful plot or character development that is equally strong and/or effective.The film is a true ensemble piece, and doesn't have a clear main character. This would be fine if the wide array of characters involved were more compellingly written, but the screenplay treats their motivations as simply second fiddle to ""style,"" world-building, and more abstract themes. Thematically, the film also seems a bit inert, seeming to jump around in subtext without providing the plot context to justify it--including through the framing device of a play. Anderson's large ensemble cast generally does pretty well with the material they are given, but their actions feel removed from consequence or plot relevance to make us feel a lot fo their characters. The brilliant craftsmanship on display mildly offsets these concerns--from the outstanding production design, cinematography, costume design, and editing--which are well-done even by Wes Anderson's standards. Yet the lack of a comparatively developed plot or character motivations is a bit jarring compared to his better films, such as ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" ""The Royal Tenebaums,"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Even the anthology structure in ""The French Dispatch"" felt more character-driven and authentic, and thus more conceptually engaging than this film. Make no mistake, Anderson is and has always been a creative visionary, and his fans should generally have a good time while watching this film. It's just a little bit unfortunate that the film comes off as more hollow and forgettable than it should, despite plenty of positive qualities as well. Recommended only to Wes Anderson fans. 6.5/10.~bastille-852-731547 rated 6/10 on 13 June 2023"," Packed to the Rafters with Nothing of Note: It is hard to think of a movie as underwhelming or as twee as Wes Anderson's 'Asteroid City,' a meandering, grandiose comic-drama as overlong as it is overindulgent. As it begins, we are told the film is in fact a televised production of a play by a fellow named Conrad Earp, which follows a ragtag bunch of misfits who gather on the isolated titular town to partake in a science convention. Among them is recent widower and war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck, who hits it off with noted actress Midge Campbell. Meanwhile, the actor playing Augie has doubts about his performance, and fears he doesn't understand the play.A fear shared by this viewer. 'Asteroid City' is a film packed to the rafters with nothing of note. The narrative is overloaded with unnecessary stylizations that distract rather than engage. Moreover, the switching back and forth between the play and the show about it is jarring throughout, while the overarching structure is alienating. It is difficult to immerse oneself in the world of the film as one is constantly reminded it is fiction. Similarly, it is no easy task connecting with the characters when the film they're in keeps telling us that they and their conflicts are imaginary.Additionally, Anderson doesn't fully explore any of the innumerable story threads he begins to unravel, nor does he properly develop his themes, whether they be about reality and fiction, the role of science and technology or the search for identity and belonging. He introduces thematic ideas in a superficial and inconsistent way, without giving them enough depth or resolution. This makes the film feel unfocused and incomplete, as it leaves the viewer with many questions and loose ends.For instance, he introduces the idea of a nuclear war looming over Asteroid City, but doesn't explore its implications or consequences for the characters or the world. He also introduces the character of Conrad Earp, the playwright behind it all, but never explains his motivations or his relationship with the actors or the audience. Moreover, he fails to conclude any of the various subplots in a meaningful or coherent way, seeming to prefer endlessly switching between different levels of artifice in a vacuum of self-satisfaction.Furthermore, the characters are all Anderson stereotypes dialled up to the max. We've seen the quirky neurotic Steenbeck before in projects like 'Rushmore' and 'Darjeeling Limited', while Campbell is essentially just Margot Tenenbaum with better hair, or any number of the beautiful, aloof ladies Anderson has given the world over the years. Each and all eccentric and mannered, the people that populate 'Asteroid City' feel like they were created by artificial intelligence trying to emulate Anderson's earlier, better movies.Likewise, the dialogue is your typical Anderson fare, full of cutesy phrases and obscure references that'll make grey-haired hipsters chuckle; though is a different breed from the likes of, say, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.' For all its faults, that film had plenty of rapid-pace witticisms and verbal sparring matches, which 'Asteroid City' has a dearth of. The dialogue is largely uninspired and inane, when it isn't contrived and artificial, as it is whenever Steenbeck's son has to converse with anyone, or when Steenbeck and Campbell share their woes through their windows.Narratively, 'Asteroid City' isolates and irritates, while Robert Yeoman's striking cinematography is cartoonish and extravagant. Yeoman makes use of bright colours, symmetrical compositions and retro-futuristic props and costumes to create a distinctive, whimsical aesthetic that reflects Anderson's trademark visual style. The attention to detail on display is laudable, while the intricacy of the sets and staging is staggering. However, Yeoman's work also contributes to the tacky artificiality and lack of subtlety of proceedings, meaning that, instead of enhancing the mood or meaning of the film, his exaggerated stylizations serve only to distract. Additionally, the score-a jumbled mixture of 50's country songs and synthetic pop- is as forgettable and bland as saltless porridge.Though Anderson has assembled a truly awesome all-star cast, nobody is giving anything particularly interesting or challenging to do. Though Jason Schwartzman does strong work as the quirky, self-absorbed neurotic Augie Steenbeck, it's a role he's played dozens of times before in better projects and to greater effect. Similarly, Scarlett Johansson impresses as the austere Midge Campbell, showing her vulnerability in a way most nuanced and affecting; though is underutilised and ultimately reduced to a mere plot device.Additionally, Bryan Cranston does a half-decent Rod Serling impression as the narrator of the piece and Tom Hanks brings pathos and power to his all too small role as Steenbeck's father-in-law, though both characters are woefully one-dimensional. Also worthy of note is Jeffrey Wright, who's consistently amusing as a caricature of an army general, and Tilda Swinton, who engages in more of the jittery over-acting that has endeared her to so many. The rest of the cavalcade of stars are generally commendable, but have little to do in the face of Anderson's scant characterisation and unengaging narrative.In conclusion, 'Asteroid City,' like 'The French Dispatch' before it, is very much a case of style over substance. Anderson's best films- perhaps tellingly all written alongside Owen Wilson- have heart and soul to match their kooky characters and painstakingly intricate visuals. 'Asteroid City' is a heartless, soulless exercise in pretension; a meandering mess of a motion picture. Though it boasts some fine performances, there's very little on offer in 'Asteroid City;' and it's certainly not a place you'd want to call home.~reelreviewsandrecommendations rated 4/10 on 16 August 2023"," He has out-Wes-Anderson himself: Wes Anderson has always been a favorite director of mine. I have seen all his movies - but for me, the magic is gone.I feel like The Grand Budapest Hotel was his masterpiece. Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while. One of us really liked it though - but she had only seen 50% of a Wes Anderson film before. The rest of us felt... full.~mennivetvadjagmenar rated 5/10 on 12 June 2023", What's the point of this movie?: This film was a huge let down. It was absolutely boring. Nothing happens in the entire film aside from a UFO/ Alien sighting which was shown in the trailers.This film is categorized as a drama/comedy/ romance and it doesn't succeed in any of them. The drama is so minimal that it's easy to overlook. This film tries to be comedic but it is so dry. I can't recall a single moment where I laughed. The slight romance it has is elementary.This film had no life to it. There wasn't anything in it that made me look forward to the next scene. It tries to be creative with a dual storyline. One storyline is that of a play in which the audience is watching as a film. The other storyline is supposed to be the behind the scenes activities of the actors who are acting in the play. It is a bit confusing at first but more than anything it unnecessarily complicates the story. The continues back and forth between the storylines does not add anything to the film. The way the scenes were split into acts was rather distracting instead of adding to the experience.There are so many well known actors in this film and not one single actor is used in a way that delivers a worthy performance. There were just too many characters for no reason. None of the characters were developed. There were a few lines stating who each character was and only two or three had something minimally happen throughout the film.The Wes Anderson's style was somewhat present but not as much as in his other films. It does have a nice use of colors but even that could not help how much this movie lacked any context.What was the point of this film?~moviemanmo rated 1/10 on 23 June 2023," Unfunny and incomprehensible: When you talk about big movie stars like Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson or Bryan Cranston... people often say, ""I'll watch them in anything."" Well, Asteroid City puts that notion to the test.This is a movie that's weird even by Wes Anderson's standards. It actually feels more like a parody of a Wes Anderson movie. And not in a good way.I would describe it like this: It's a movie of a TV broadcast of a play about a play... and what we see is the movie version of the play within the play within the TV show (I think I have all of that right... it's all very confusing). What's missing in all of this is any real plot or characters to care about. It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I like Anderson's films, but I just didn't get this one.~jmoney-2 rated 1/10 on 1 July 2023"," Worst of his movies, such a waste for this amazing cast: This is by far the worst of his movies. Such an incredible cast and he did nothing with them, the acting is good but the lack of an interesting story is unbelievable. It's a pretty film, yes, but even visually, it's the least interesting from his work. French dispatch was his first strike, Asteroid city is his second, really hope there's not a third. Hope he hires a good writer or writers to help him with his next films. We know he can do art direction, photography, and a few funny bits, but he needs someone to help him with plots. Really, with such an amazing cast, to come up with this, is so so so sad. What a waste. Truly disappointed.~fangel-31778 rated 4/10 on 18 June 2023"," Unmitigated bore of a film: This was a total disappointment from the start. The entire conceit, that it is a film within a play within a film is completely without interest. It seems to be a formal exercise in how far one can push a metaphor to the point where it has lost any meaning.I found myself falling asleep to it at one point when all the characters, each one looking into the lens, emote their lines without any emotional commitment whatsoever. The only one who seems to have any desire to project an iota of emotion, Scarlett Johansson, does her best to keep her audience interested, but even her attempt falls flat.There are numerous A-list cameos that have no reason to exist except to lend credence to the Auteur that Mr. Anderson has become. His obsession with proclaiming his own superiority leaves most of the cast cold, and even the best efforts by Tom Hanks and Adrien Brody cannot redeem what little story there is.The actors simply phone in their performances, particularly Jason Schwartzman, oddly enough, portraying a widower who does not grieve in front of his mismatched children, none of whom seems to notice their missing mother. Kudoes go to the three little girls who portray his daughters (blonde and blue eyed?) but who handle their roles like pros.Not much can be said for the rest of the cast, all of whom show up and portray their cardboard characters as best as they can, and the entire thing is missing any kind of heart -- it lasts way too long and by the time we have reached the anti-climax, we feel cheated out of any kind of feeling whatsoever.~naq-1 rated 2/10 on 16 June 2023"," This cast doesn't deserve this script: Wes Anderson drummed up a magnificent cast. At least ten of them could carry a triple A movie by themselves. Unfortunately, Wes forgot that a good movie needs a good plot as well.The visuals are outstanding, almost every shot is also an award winning photo. The acting is superb. The setting is magnificent and almost everything about this movie is perfect.Everything but the plot. If you like humor, you'll like this film. If you come for the visuals, you'll love this film. If you're into acting, you'll have an excellent time. But if you want to be engaged? Look elsewhere.Dear Wes, your dialogues are hilarious and witty. Your plots lack substance. Work on your plots.~spavaai rated 7/10 on 16 June 2023"," Style Over Substance: Near enough the definition of style over substance. At times seemed deliberately boring. Too much effort was spent in an attempt to seem clever, and not enough effort spent trying to be enjoyable.Occasional lines were enough to raise a slight chuckle, or an exhale of air, but they are much too few and far between in the vast stretches of emptiness.The impressive cast assembled don't do an awful job with what they've been given, but none of the characters have any depth whatsoever. Even if they were, there are far too many characters to form any kind of cohesion.It's quirky at best and painfully dull.~andyman789 rated 3/10 on 24 June 2023"," There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste,: I saw 'ASTEROID CITY' yesterday...and I have amixed feelings about it....As usual, stylistically very impressive, with strong emphasis on ensemble work of actors, as it's usually happens in Wes Anderson's movies.When movie is considered ensemble piece the pressure of a film success falls on the shoulders of the director. In a normal narrative film the protagonist and antagonist often take the burden of film success on themselves, hoping that the audience will emphasize with our lead characters and their character arc, to be immersed in the story during the full running time.There is a risk however if the audience doesn't connect with performances the status of leading man or a woman is in jeopardy, with producers in the future not wanting to green light another film with actors, which were unable to handle the ""weight"" of the movie.This is why plenty of actors like to work on movies which offer ensemble feel. They don't have to spend many months on filmset, instead they come for few days, shoot their scenes and can move on to the next project. If their performance didn't work they are always supported by other quality actors, so it doesn't ruin the whole film. In ether way Wes Anderson's style always comes on top, as actors who work with him understand the particular speed of lines delivery, as well as dryness of the dialog.Stylistically it's very much what we expect from Anderson. Cinematography is more interesting then usual with a strong emphasis on production and costumes design. The camera movement feel bit more free then usual and yet the composition is always full of symmetry, which is the calling card of Wes. He even included few inserts (close ups of objects, which normally make thinks appear more cinematic) which for his filmmaking style is rather unusual. As well as few ""Dutch angles"", which make the audience feel sense of distorted reality in moments of surrealism.The color correction ranging from black and white to colorful over saturation is rather visually interesting.There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste, although fans of Anderson know what to expect and should have a good time.More casual viewers might feel like this film is a little stylistically disjointed.For me I appreciate what Wes was trying to accomplish and always admire his stylistic consistency, which has its benefits (you know what to expect), but also it's throwbacks, when Wes just like in this case is trying to explore a new filmmaking narrative techniques.Recommend! 👍~j-madej rated 7/10 on 17 June 2023"

Working as an elf in a year-round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn--that seems too good to be true."," POST HOLIDAY PLEASER: When you choose to make a film based around a holiday you run the risk of the film being bypassed once that holiday is over. Even during the holidays I had no real desire to see the film LAST CHRISTMAS. So imagine my surprise to find it one of the most delightful films I've seen in some time.Emilia Clarke stars as Kate, a young woman living in London who works in an all year round Christmas shop dressed as an elf. Her boss is simply named Santa (Michelle Yeoh), an owner who has a habit of stocking some unusual items in her store. While working there Kate also attempts to launch a career singing in productions, auditioning for nearly any part available and never landing a role.Kate is in the middle of a bad period in her life. Her career is going nowhere, she has no place of her own to live, counting on the kindness of her friends to put her up. But even there her luck runs bad as she doesn't take long to do something that results in her being kicked out. Her love life is on the outs as well with frequent hookups that lead to nothing more serious than a one night stand. Her relationship with her sister is one of mutual disapproval and the one with her mother is even worse.Kate's mother (Emma Thompson who also wrote the story and produced the film) calls her by her proper name Katerina and worries about her non-stop. Much of this is due to an illness Kate had the previous year which we don't get details on until later. When all of her friends boot her out Kate has no choice but to return home to live.Then one day something happens. She sees an attractive young man outside the shop looking up at the sky. Going out to see what he's looking at, he points out a bird to her claiming it's unusual to see this bird in the city. They talk a bit and he convinces her to walk with him later. Doing so he shows her a small alley, giving her the history of it and showing that it ends up in a small garden courtyard with benches that people can sit on.Kate becomes infatuated with the man who she learns is named Tom (Henry Golding). He tells her he works late nights but before he goes to work they continue to spend time together. One place he lets her know he works is a mission for homeless people. When Tom doesn't show one night, she goes there looking for him only to be recruited into helping.The relationship between Tom and Kate builds as the movie progresses but they never sleep together. He tells her he's old fashioned like that. As they spend time together things begin to change for Kate. She becomes happier. She becomes less selfish. She starts helping other people, especially at the homeless shelter. But will that happiness carry on? Will Tom be there for her forever? Will something happen that changes everything?In spite of revealing a lot of what takes place in the film so far I'm holding back on much of it. That's because this movie did something that so few do for me these days. It surprised me. It caught me off guard. I've seen so many movies that rarely happens and when it does it make me happy to see that this is still possible.The surprise is not all that makes me recommend this movie. It has a bright, fresh feeling to it in spite of the life that Kate lives when we first meet her. The film doesn't rely on naked bodies or four letter words to present a story of two people in love unlike most films today. Instead it harkens back to the romantic screwball comedies of the past relying on witty writing, great performances and a story that captures the heart.Clarke is known mostly for her role in GAME OF THRONES but shows that she has so much potential to move past that into Sandra Bullock territory, a romantic lead with the ability to make you laugh as well. Golding is a surprise, having only been in six films to far, his first being CRAZY RICH ASIANS where he did an amazing job as well. Thompson is hilarious here as an immigrant fearful of everything and concerned for her children.As I said at the start, I had no interest in this movie when it was released. I not admit that the film was a charming, refreshing change of pace that will entertain, enlighten and make you think twice about the world we live in. With music obviously written by the late George Michael used throughout, it's a movie that you should watch, in spite of Christmas having come and gone.~kirbylee70-599-526179 rated 8/10 on 9 March 2020"," Look up......: Just when we think the gush of Christmas commercials and specials are over, along comes LAST CHRISTMAS, and if ever there were a film that could enchant, this is one that does. Written by Emma Thompson (who also plays a significant role in the movie) and Greg Wise with screenplay adaptation aided by Bryony Kimmings, the film seems a bit of fluff, overly decorated, until the messages begin to sink in. And by the end the film is elevating, thanks to some fine acting and direction. George Michael's music plays a primary role, also.Katrina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store owned by 'Santa' (Michele Yeoh) is not good for the wannabe singer. However, there she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a kind-hearted man with a mysterious past who challenges her cynical worldview. Kate slowly comes to realize that Tom is 'significant' and her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. Completing the entourage is Kate's Yugoslavian immigrant family - mother Petra (Emma Thompson), father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) and sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) - each with conflicts and problems of their own. It all comes together with a discovery (one that should not be shared) and the grand finale at the homeless sanctuary is rich in honest goodwill - 'helping each other.'This is a feel good movie, well acted, and one that can be uplifting - if you've a mind to be uplifted!~gradyharp rated 8/10 on 24 February 2020"," Not What I Expected- in a good way!: A surprisingly clever, funny, and charming flick- Last Christmas hits its heartfelt moments tenderly in all the right ways, even with providing some small funny moments throughout. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are by far the standouts in the film, providing some truly great chemistry and poignant performances in the film. The acting is just one surprise of many in the film, as it is often clever with it's writing and progression of the story taken forward. The film does have a bit of an issue with editing, but nothing that ruins the film in a whole. It also is a bit corny and formulaic at times, providing typical tropes seen in movies of a similar nature, that just feel out of place, and if not, just plan obvious. However, the film is able to turn itself around from these remarks and become something truly special, and by all means heartwarming. The film is purely enjoyable, at times surprisingly inspiring, and full of an absolutely wonderful soundtrack of tunes from the legendary George Michael. In the end, Last Christmas surpassed my expectations on every account, and proves to be more than just a christmas romance film in all the right ways.My Rating: 9/10~aidanratesmovies rated 9/10 on 13 March 2020"," The real mystery: The real mystery is not the plot twist. The real mystery is, what happened to our expectations about movies to make so many people think they can easily find a ""better"" X-mas movie somewhere else, making it OK to give this one a low rating? For the last few decades, some 95% of all the X-mas movies produced have come from Canada, using basically the same actors and writers, and they do not even come close to this one. This is a real movie that engages and holds the attention, with real talent both in front of and behind the camera. Cmon people, follow the example of the main character in LAST XMAS, grow up.~A_Different_Drummer rated 10/10 on 8 January 2020"," Magic in the mix: I think this is the most captivating Christmas movie since ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".It just takes a while to realise it.Kate (Emilia Clarke) is beautiful and likeable, but she's too self-focussed, which tends to make her careless, testing the tolerance of friends and family. When she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a young man who comes and goes, she is challenged to become a better person and turn her life around. Eventually we find out how and why.The backdrop is London at Christmas and among the Christmas lights and pre-COVID streets packed with shoppers we get George Michael songs, Eastern Orthodox church services; lines of homeless waiting in the cold; an over-the top Christmas gift shop where Kate works dressed as an elf; and Kate's overly clinging mother, Petra, played by Emma Thompson going to town on her ""Former Yugoslavia"" accent.There is almost too much happening. I wondered how it would all come together. However it does and finishes on a high. Luckily, I hadn't seen any spoilers and didn't see it coming - I definitely got my money's worth.Topping the whole thing off like the brightest star on the Christmas tree is Emilia Clarke. There is no shortage of brilliant, beautiful British actresses who also shine on countless talk shows. However, none have ever outshone Emilia Clarke.""Game of Thrones"" is one thing, but the real phenomenon is how much fun she has generated talking about it and every other aspect of her life to people like Ellen DeGeneres, David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and especially Graham Norton, who has the rare knack of eliciting revelations about sex scenes and embarrassing moments without seeming sleazy.Emilia has discovered the charm of self-deprecating wit; she can tell a story against herself. Anyway, whenever she's lost for words, she has that infectious laugh and those amazing eyebrows - not only that, she can sing!She lights up the screen from the moment she appears. The combination of Emilia Clarke with good-looking, uber-charming Henry Golding gives ""Last Christmas"" a touch of magic.There are plenty of Christmas movies, literally hundreds, but there are only a few that are perennial classics. I think ""Last Christmas"" is destined to be one of them.~tomsview rated 9/10 on 9 January 2021"," Ignore the negative reviews, ""look up"" , and realise what a great film this is.: I don't understand why the critics have been so harsh on this film - I thoroughly enjoyed it!Yes, it's predictable, but what Christmas film isn't really?With a wonderful central performance from the ever lovely Emilia Clarke and with good support from Emma Thompson, this is a wonderful film with a lovely message.I would say give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.~studioAT rated 8/10 on 23 November 2019"," Infused with George Michael's music and Emma Thompson's grand wit, this dramedy has much laughter, tears, and heart: Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant to Britain, with her family, coming after Yugoslavia broke up. Once singing in church, she longs to make it in musical theater. However, life has thrown her off track. Her mother (Emma Thompson) is overbearing, her sister is a successful lawyer with sharp disagreements with Kate, and our Katarina has health problems. So, now, Kate works at a year-round Christmas store, as an elf-saleslady under the direction of store owner, Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Its a living? Well, yes, but Kate has been couch surfing and has no permanent home but her parents house. One day she meets a handsome man on a bicycle, Tom (Henry Golding) who advises her to ""look up"". Its akin to stop and smelling the roses but Kate wants none of this gooey philosophy, at first. But, on subsequent encounters, Kate begins to notice things she's never seen before and to appreciate the friendship/love Tom has been offering. Can Tom change Kate's life for the good? This lovely new addition to the repertoire of Christmas cinema has a strong foundation in its script by Emma Thompson, a wonderful cast, lovely sets and costumes, and the eternally grand music of George Michael in its soundtrack. Be prepared for laughter and tears, as unexpected happenings keep arriving. But, in short, don't be last in line for Last Christmas!~inkblot11 rated 8/10 on 17 November 2019"," Not what you think: The movie may appear to be cliched, but the film is so far beyond what the trailers made it look. Also a great tribute to the late singer George Michael, a good portion of his songs are playing through out.Kate(Emilia Clarke) has become a train wreck, after a heath scare a year ago, her family life is gone crazy. And her job is also going down, and during the time of Christmas. And things start to change when she meets Tom(Henry Golding), a handsome nice guy who tries to take her out of her misery, but is he too good to be true?I really like the way the film was not trying to be predicable, I mean you think it's going in one direction, and it surprises you. There is a twist, which I won't reveal, although I kind of saw coming. Emilia Clarke does shine has Kate, scenes you like her even though at times you're not supposed to like her, but you can't help but like her. Henry Golding is also quite charming, his scenes with Clarke, are quite joyful to watch. Michelle Yeoh is also good.

But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable, there are some really fun moments. We at least finally have the split up family vs just one crazy family. Reese really turned on the charm and stole this movie, she was so adorable and she was great in the jump jump scene with the evil kids. Vince had some moments as well, but it's more the supporting cast that was just a fun addition to the story.When upscale, happily unmarried San Francisco couple Kate and Brad find themselves socked in by fog on Christmas morning, their exotic vacation plans morph into the family-centric holiday they had, until now, gleefully avoided. Out of obligation-and unable to escape-they trudge to not one, not two, but four relative-choked festivities, increasingly mortified to find childhood fears raised, adolescent wounds reopened...and their very future together uncertain. As Brad counts the hours to when he can get away from their parents, step-parents, siblings and an assortment of nieces and nephews, Kate is starting to hear the ticking of a different kind of clock. And by the end of the day, she is beginning to wonder if their crazy families' choices are not so crazy after all.I would recommend Four Christmases just if you wanna see a cute holiday movie in the theater this year. Vince and Reese had good chemistry and this movie just represents the craziness of having to go to all the families every year for Christmas. There are some really good laughs here and there, I loved the scene where Reese played the Virgin Mary and Vince was Joesph in their church play and Reese just gets stage fright and freezes while Vince just makes a fool of himself on stage. Over all this is a cute movie, there's nothing special about it, but it's worth the look.6/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 6/10 on 1 December 2008"," The Continued Dumbing Down Of Comedy: This film has the perfect setup to be a big hit...it comes out on DVD over the holidays when (many) people are, after a day or two, trying to get away from the relatives for awhile, and the plot even centers on that same subject matter! Yet, through a multitude of problems, first and foremost being the continued dumbing down of what people must think is funny, it fails to resonate on any level.Basically, the story sees a couple (played by Reece Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn) trying to escape their holiday family get-togethers due to tension from both sets of parents. However, when their flight to Fiji is cancelled due to fog, they are forced to spend the day at four different homes (both sets of their parents are divorced) celebrating Christmas. They meet a wide variety of odd characters and even begin to drift away from each other once past secrets begin to be revealed.While that may sound like an interesting concept, it just doesn't get off the group. First, the lead couple, though played by the very competent Witherspoon and Vaughn, are so unlikable that you really can't get drawn into their relationship. In fact, you may actually root AGAINST them as they are so annoying. Secondly, the auxiliary family members that should bring the comedy to the film are, in actually, quite annoying themselves also. Not until the last home do you get a touch of interesting character development, but by then you really don't care anymore.However, the biggest problem with the entire film is that it relies on far too many sight gags and an over abundance of crude humor. The scenes in the film that should get the biggest laughs involve ""Vaughn"" falling off a roof, a breast pump, and a baby vomiting. Now I suppose that when it comes to humor it's sort of ""to each his own"", but personally I feel that resorting to that type of humor is a cheap way to get a chuckle (if that) and doesn't really endear itself to viewers.Thus, here is the real test of whether or not I found this to be enjoyable whatsoever: After finishing it, I flipped around my cable TV and found two great films on...Father of the Bride and When Harry Met Sally. After just 15 minutes of flipping back and forth between those two, I had more laughs than during the entire 88 minutes of Four Christmases.~zkonedog rated 3/10 on 12 March 2017"," How does this Movie only have a 5.7: This is movie is Hilarious it has now worked it way into our Family's always watch during the Holidays up there with Planes Trains and Automobiles and NL X-mas Vacation.This is Vaughn on his A-Game, in my experience, You either love or hate Vince.. I personally have been a Fan since Swingers and Made. Witherspoon is decent and holds her own, but this is Vince's Movie for sure.The scene where they visit Vaughn's Dad (the Amazing Robert Duvall) along with life long partner in crime Actor/MEGA Director Jon Favreau and the surprisingly natural actor Tim McGraw alone is worth the rental of this movie alone, and Mother Visit with Sissy Spacek and a Cameo from Swingers as her new Husband is also Fantastic.If youre not laughing out loud during these 2 scenes you dont know what Comedy is..Check this out if you wasnt to Laugh... a Fan of Vince Vaughn/Jon Favreau etc.Vaughn's performance is on point here.. just as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Breakup""For some younger great VV performance's Check out ""Clay Pigeons"" and ""Domestic Disturbance""~tonyzeno75 rated 8/10 on 8 September 2020"," Criminally Underrated. A Very Solid Christmas Movie.: Four Christmases is WAY better than I remembered it being. I think people dismiss this movie because of the puke jokes, the crass ""Southern working class"" stereotypes, the kids hitting and jumping on adults. I get it. But I'd argue all of that is window dressing - attempts to keep this film as a comedy - rather than the ""point"" of the movie.Four Christmases - stay with me here - is a meditation on family, relationships, and Christmas. Unlike so many other films, this one has a more grounded take than I expected: family isn't perfect, Christmas doesn't solve all of the problems, sometimes family members are just bad for you to be around and maybe, it's okay to acknowledge that. But, with all of this in mind, family grounds us; they're people we don't choose to be around, but people we're around because we all need people in our lives who will be with us, no matter how different we are. There's something special about connecting with a person who isn't ""exactly"" like you and finding something to appreciate.I really like the ethos of this movie; that this no-it all, protypical liberal couple - Vaughn and Witherspoon - realize that for all their freedom, they don't have the depth of connection their family members do; all their condescension and status flies out the window. Yeah, this movie is deeper than you probably remember.It's also pretty funny, with some really standout jokes and actors who are generally really great. John Favreau is a scene stealer, playing so far away from type, it's a joy every time he's on screen. Kristin Chenoweth is solid as well, but come on...Sissy Spacek? Robert Duvall? John Voight? Mary Steenburgen? This cast is stacked with legends who do an amazing job and give the film a ""ghosts of Christmas"" vibe with how different they all are. Oddly enough, I think Vaughn and Witherspoon are fine here; really anyone could've played these characters, and it's the other actors who make this movie for me.Is this movie predictable? A little silly? A bit low brow? Sure. Is it fun? Yes. Does it have heart? Yes. It's a solid Christmas comedy and I think I'd recommend it to basically anyone looking for some laughs with their cheer.~ryanpersaud-59415 rated 7/10 on 14 December 2023"," Snappy Comedy Touches Smothered by Hollywood Overkill in Standard Holiday Fare: This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"". Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wrote ""The Hangover""), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket rolls over the city and ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary, ""The King of Kong"", and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other than two different screen formats.~EUyeshima rated 5/10 on 26 November 2009"," Bounce Bounce and Baby Barf: Greetings again from the darkness. Vince Vaughn is starting to remind me of what Woody Allen went through ... ""I liked his funny movies"". Just wasn't a fan of ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The Break-up"", but I certainly recognize his comedic talents. Here, his quirks play a little better, though I never really bought off on he and Reece Witherspoon as a couple.Low expectations, a strong cast, a few clever lines, easily relatable family strain, and a true sight ""gag"" make this one enjoyable enough. The trailer gives away the set-up of the film as Reece and Vince are forced to visit all four pieces of their disjointed families on Christmas. For some reason, director Seth Gordon (""King of Kong"") casts Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek as VV's parents and Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen as Reece's. The curiosity stems from the age difference between these actors ... a 15-16 year span. Just struck me as odd. Though not quite as odd as Jon Voight offering parental advice. Now THAT is comedy! Despite the hi-jinx, the messages abound: we all have the weirdest family, it is never easy to really connect with another person, and it's always a good time for cheese whiz. This is really VV's film as Reece has little to offer save for the bounce bounce scene. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation.One warning to parents: the film is rated PG-13 and there is a segment regarding the Santa secret, so be forewarned. The unwritten rule is broken. The quick lines and uncomfortable family moments make this one worth a few giggles. Not a Christmas classic, but a decent comedy.I must mention the tribute to the classic ""A Christmas Story"" as the kids peer into the toy store window early on. That scene is followed by the airport scene, where the ticket agent is played by none other than Peter Billingsley, a grown up Ralphie from that movie (and producer of this film).~ferguson-6 rated 6/10 on 28 November 2008"," Utterly predictable but there are some good laughs: Couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) have been dating for three years but have no interest in getting married or having babies. They avoid their families (4 of them--both of their parents are divorced) by saying they have some charity mission to do. However they're caught on camera one Christmas and have to promise to visit all their 4 families that one day. Naturally all their families are somewhat strange and familiar (but funny) complications ensure.I saw this for a few reasons--it got good reviews from critics; it's been an OK hit (so far); I like Vaughn and Witherspoon and it's hard to resist a movie with FOUR Academy Award winning actors in supporting roles--Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight. It's not a great movie at all but it had a few good laughs and--at 88 minutes--it doesn't wear out its welcome. Supposedly Vaughn and Witherspoon didn't get along at all while working on this but you'd never know it from the film. They have some great chemistry and their comedic timing is right on target. The rest of the cast is as good as anyone could be and they all act well enough to make the entirely predictable story go down smoothly. It's not perfect. I could have lived without the TWO instances of projectile vomiting and Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw were too vicious and unfunny as Vaughn's brothers. Some people find seeing other people beaten up hysterically funny but I'm not one of them. Still these are small parts of the movie. All in all a good enjoyable holiday film.~preppy-3 rated 7/10 on 23 December 2008"," Have Your Christmas Cake And Eat It Too: Sigh. Another potentially funny Hollywood comedy hits the skids when it encounters a message. The message here seems to be, ""Families Are Hideous And Awful, But Everyone Should Be Forced To Have One"". No, I don't understand the logic of that either.The families are made up of 4 sets of familiar comedy archetypes - the yokels, the interfering women, the religious kooks and - um - the fourth set who the writers couldn't be bothered to make interesting or unusual. I suppose you can't blame them for losing interest - I know I had.Phoned-in performances and a faxed-in script result in a charmless, pointless holiday film. The only good thing about it is the charisma of the leads, and a funny appearance by Jon Favreau. But seriously, you would be better advised to watch National Lampoon's Xmas Vacation again instead.~Parks rated 3/10 on 26 December 2009"," One of my favs: It's hilarious hilarious hilarious hilarious until it's serious, with a great and simple message. I watch it every year. Great cast. Terrific acting.Happy Holidays!~laragi rated 6/10 on 12 November 2021"," Phoned in film did respectably at the box office...: ... and I have no idea why. This is one of dozens of holiday films made over the last twenty years, and I don't get quite why that is true when Hollywood makes fewer films overall than they did in studio days before TV, yet there is a glut of these kinds of films versus the 30s through the 70s.It is completely predictable in its outcome. And that doesn't mean the fun is in the journey either because that is paint by numbers too. What you have is a yuppie couple played by Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon who spend every Christmas on Fiji to avoid their dysfunctional families, but this year they are fogged in and stuck at home. A news crew interviewing them alerts their families to their availability and so they are forced to trudge to ""four Christmases"" since every parent is divorced and having their own Christmas. Both moms are oversexed in spite of being postmenopausal. Vaughn's dad is a lonely old man. Well, I should say he is a man alone because he seems quite happy in his solitary hermit existence.And in spite of the fact that the first three of these four gatherings are disasters, Witherspoon reveals to Vaughn that she probably does want to get married, that she does want to have kids. Vaughn quips that if anything should say they were right in traveling light through life it was the disaster that was today.I could say watch and find out what happens, but 98% of you will write the ending that happened without even seeing it.Why does Hollywood make these kinds of movies in the modern era? Maybe to make people feel better about themselves because their families couldn't possibly be this outrageous? To say ""Everyone else procreated and it was a disaster and so should I""? Maybe just because a sloppy script with cliched plot devices and Christmas lights pack them in during the Holidays and after all, isn't that the point?You won't be the worse for watching this because I guarantee you've seen it before under a different name, but I wouldn't seek it out if you can find a better film to watch.~AlsExGal rated 5/10 on 16 December 2018"

She may be in store for a Christmas miracle when she falls for a big city playboy who is sent to get intel on a prospective vineyard for sale.," Not the usual formulaic holiday film, it's very watchable.: Stumbled across this movie and settled back thinking it would be another formulaic holiday rom-com. It was very watchable with a script that was good. Most of the dialog was actually good, it wasn't typical sickly sweet Christmas movie drivel. The cast can act, I wasn't familiar with all of them but they can act, especially the leads Josh Swickard and Sol Rodriguez. Josh Swickard is good doing comedy, I'm surprised he's not a Hallmark regular. Omar Gooding was good as Moe Walker, hardware store owner and part time garagiste. The two young actors playing Fer and Santi are very good. The setting apparently is Santa Clarita, CA unlike so many of the holiday rom-coms that are filmed in Canada.Kudos to the cast, writers and director. It has flaws but it's well worth watching.~Avidviewer-02847 rated 8/10 on 16 December 2023"," Privileged wino makes good: If you're looking for a fun, feel good rom com to take your mind off reality for a couple hours you've found it. You've got a talented cast (even the kids seemed to be pretty good actors for kids in a movie like this), a fun if familiar storyline and some great dialogue. The two main actors are definitely up and comers and definitely worth checking out. This movie won't change your politics or cause you to question any of your major life decisions, but it's a couple hours of fun that flies by like a Christmas party with old friends. If you are into rom coms you should definitely give this one a watch.~matchincaddies rated 9/10 on 18 December 2023"," It's all grape juice to me but this is a fun flick: Even if you don't drink wine, this is a solid, fun rom com just in time to take your mind off the dystopian disfunction that is the modern world, and most of what Netflix puts out. Like all rom coms it is predictable but it is also fun along the way. The performances and execution are top notch. The male lead is great. He is funny and convincing. And his eventual love interest has the charm and spark of a young Salma Hayek, (sans juggs). They even a have a real housewife of somewhere. I don't like those shows but I'm happy to see one of them channeling all that drama up onto the big screen where it worked well. And have to admit it, she was good. All in all this is a fun flick worth checking out.~getthedamnbell rated 9/10 on 23 December 2023"," Proper film, feel good and with great cast: I love an upbeat festive film but they can be a wee bit twee so I was pleasantly surprised by something that felt relative to today's world and not just a throwback to old school mills n boon romance. Great chemistry between all cast, rounded characters a female lead you could have a good girls night out with, and a very funny (and ripped!) male co-star. Sure there's some schmaltzy bits but hey, it's a Christmas rom com so that's kinda required, but it's all thoroughly entertaining and the script and acting elevated it above the bog standard formulaic afternoon movies which are fine to pass the time, but this is better :-) raise your glasses and sample some delicious festive fun.~warringtonkarina rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," good movie: A widow who wants to save a local vineyard meets a stranger both fell in love but she has certain limitations like her two kids, save the local vineyard or the stranger.

However, it is an enjoyable film, it has the cliché story of a capricious millionaire boy, who leads a chaotic life and is sent to a town incognito to discover information about a wine company that his family wants to buy, there he meets in this town to a widow with 2 children who wants to buy this company together with other neighbors. Carter begins to relate to her, her children and her people, ultimately changing her way of being. It is a film to spend the afternoon, enjoy, not complicated.~glori1491 rated 8/10 on 29 December 2023"," Romantic Fun with Comedy and Adult Conversations: This plot is what you expect. But, the writing is truly adult conversations with grown up relationship witticisms. Not the tripe of Hallmark. We both enjoyed it and it was nice to hear clever dialogue. There's a talented cast (even the kids seemed to appeared as you'd expect). The two main actors are definitely winners and worth checking out. And the secondary actors are strong in their own right. They provide the comical aspect. The story kept the banker way in the background so you don't see any ludicrous across the desk back and forth or whining. A couple hours of fun and easy enjoyment. If you are into romantic comedies you should definitely give this one a look.~vintagegeek-97465 rated 9/10 on 1 January 2024"," Hallmark Soap Opera Christmas Movie: Holiday in the Vineyards is a Netflix B rated romantic comedy and our sixth Christmas movie of 2023. The story is about a big city playboy who is sent to outbid an estate sale in a fictional California town called Los Santos. The city name is also described in GTA within the same content as this film. The playboy played by Josh Swickard ends up helping and working for a widower and her two boys. The widower is played by Sol Rodriguez along with her best friend Carly Jibson and the town carpenter who is played by Omar Gooding. Eileen Davidson played Josh's mother who ends up buying the land that was previously owned by the family back in the early 1900's. Most of these characters are stars from the soap opera shows, good actors but subpar slow predictable storyline. I will never watch or remember this one again.~lakings97 rated 6/10 on 29 December 2023"," Josh brings his best feature: There are several axes upon which to rate a film, but for a Josh Swickard film, the most important is clearly how good does Josh look in this film, how often is he shirtless, is his chest well lit or in shadows, and how much as he trimmed his chest hair.On those critical factors, this is his 2d best feature film. While it offers almost the same number and quality of shirtless scenes as in the original ""A California Christmas,"" his chest is way overly clipped here and he almost looks smooth. The original CC showed him off at his most hirsute and he looked great. There was also a gay couple and a little more heart in that movie.Anyway, I did enjoy this flick for what is was, though ""Die Hard"" is arguably more of a Christmas flick. All the craftsmanship was serviceable.Thank you Josh and Netflix for some lite fun holiday fare.~LeatherCajun rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"," Are you kidding me?: Don't even need to watch this to know. Did multiple double takes though just to make sure I wasn't crazy because this is just a lazy rip off of ""A California Christmas"" with the same lead actor! Wtf?! Are you serious? How many times is Netflix just gunna rehash the same old story? A Cali Xmas wasn't even that good. It was slightly above average for an average sappy love story from Netflix and that's not saying much. Maybe not even that because the 2 leads are very easy on the eyes so they probably mask a lot of the movies short comings, if you're brain dead and content with just drooling over them I guess. I have no words. Just lazy. But it's Netflix so can we expect anything else?~Mr_Right_1138 rated 1/10 on 22 December 2023"
