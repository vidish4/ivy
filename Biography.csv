Maestro (2023) - IMDb,6.8,Carey Mulligan|Bradley Cooper|Matt Bomer|Vincenzo Amato|Greg Hildreth|Michael Urie|Brian Klugman|Nick Blaemire|Mallory Portnoy|Alexandra Santini|Jarrod LaBine|Sarah Silverman|Kate Eastman|William Hill|Valéry Lessard|Renée Stork|Tim Rogan|Sara Sanderson,Bradley Cooper,Bradley Cooper|Josh Singer,This love story chronicles the lifelong relationship of conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.," Beautiful to look at, gorgeous music, but no story.: I went to Maestro expecting a film that would chronicle the life of one of America's, if not the world's, great composer/conductors. I've seen Leonard Bernstein many, many times, starting at age 8 when my grandfather took me to Bernstein's music for kids on Saturday mornings at Lincoln Center. I had no idea who he was at the time, only that people called him Lenny. My grandpa took me to meet him and he was spellbinding. I remember him looking right threw me with his expressive eyes.He loved kids and loved to teach them about music. Turns out grandpa and Lenny went to Harvard together, hence I got a personal introduction. Bernstein is the guy that got me hooked on classical music and music in general, but I didn't learn anything about his musical career, his childhood, his years at Harvard, his work in Europe, who inspired him, etc.The making of West Side Story is really interesting (if you know the story) but nothing about it in this film and I mean ""nothing.; We get a tiny glimpse of Candide, but nothing about its composition or insight into the Maestro's process. We get zero insight into his Missa Brevis, perhaps on the highlights of his career.Bradley Cooper blew me away. I've seen Lenny up close many times and I've talked to him a few times. Cooper nailed it, and the scene at St John of the Divine is probably one of the greatest musical scenes ever captured on film. Cooper's conducting is simply amazing. He worked very very hard to capture the speech, mannerisms, and the Bernstein attitude and texture toward music. I cannot speak highly enough of Cooper's performance, but we get so little insight into the musician, and that was so disappointing.Carey Mulligan? Her performance is nothing less than spectacular, in fact all the acting is extraordinary, but it's not a story. The Bernstein children really have nothing to do in this film, and I have no idea why Lenny's sister was included as she has very little to say or do. Overall, a very perplexing film ... not sure what he was going for. In fact, I kept waiting for it to start. The emphasis was all on style, and believe me, it's beautiful to look at.~rich-fouts rated 6/10 on 14 December 2023"," Showcases Everything Least Interesting About Bernstein's Life: When Amy Schumer was roasting the film ""Being the Ricardos"" at the Oscars a couple of years ago, she was making fun of Aaron Sorkin for writing a screenplay about the most iconic female comedian of all time that didn't have a single funny moment. She compared it to making a biopic about Michael Jordan and only showing the bus trips between games.Bradley Cooper, pay attention. Why did you choose to make a movie about Leonard Bernstein, arguably one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century, and then focus on all of the most mundane aspects of his life? Do we need yet another movie about a famous person bogged down with scene after scene of them squabbling with their spouse? If you don't already know why Bernstein is so legendary, you're not going to learn it here. You might not even come away from the movie knowing what Bernstein wrote, because the film tosses out titles quickly and casually as it's rushing to get to the next scene of Cooper overacting and Carey Mulligan looking strained as all long-suffering wives in all biopics ever made must do. You don't see him developing any projects or working with collaborators. The movie implies that he was disdainful of his success in musical theater despite revolutionizing it with ""West Side Story."" But then why did he spend so much time working in it if he hated it? Why weren't we at least treated with someone doing a cameo appearance as Stephen Sondheim? Why why why?And then to top it all off, the last quarter of the film is a dreary slog as we watch Mulligan slowly die of cancer. I despise it when movies show characters slowly dying of cancer. It freaks me out, and I hate it. I know this woman actually did die of cancer, but I don't want to watch it. That's more my problem than it is the movie's, because that's what happened, but still.Cooper's screenplay is terrible, and because of that, nothing else about the movie has a chance. Mulligan is quite good, but she's hampered by the material. Cooper will be nominated for an Oscar, and might win, because the Academy loves nothing more than rewarding actors for playing famous people while heaped under prosthetic makeup. To the film's credit, for once the makeup is quite good. Usually biopic makeup makes the actors look like their faces are about to melt off, but here the effect is pretty seamless.Someone clearly told Bradley Cooper that Warren Beatty is the only person to ever score Oscar nominations for producing, directing, writing, and acting in the same film, and Cooper said ""Hold my beer."" He's so desperately hankering for an Oscar for this film that you can smell red carpet wafting from the screen.Grade: C-~evanston_dad rated 4/10 on 21 December 2023"," Mesmirising portrait, but not in the way I had expected...: Beware, this is a movie about Bernstein's marriage, NOT about his music. It should have better been titled as ""The Marriage of Leonard & Felicia"" and not ""Maestro"".I expected a music biopic, but what I got was a masterfully directed and terrifically acted portrait of a marriage with a bisexual husband and all the difficulties (secret affairs with gay men) that came along with it, when back in the days of the fifties and sixties, being gay wasnt something one could openly talk about in public.The good: LONG scenes with NO editing cuts. What BLISS to be able to watch these 2 great actors perform uninhibited by cuts, with many minutes long lasting scenes filmed from 1 static angle. I truly applaud the director (Bradley Cooper) and the photographer and editor for this gorgeous and balanced way of filming this portrait. I was really impressed!Any bad? I had my trepidations about Bradley Cooper's impersonation of Bernstein that was borderline according to many. Did he pull it off? I think he did a really good job, although it took me some time to get used to all the mannerisims (the peculiar voice in particular). I can understand though that others might get a bit uneasy / irritated by some of the makeup (too much?) and other mannerisims.Carey Mulligan (as the wife of Bernstein) deserves special mention. Her role was more subdued and subtle, but AS powerful and touching. She truly shined!Conclusion: I am not a fan of watching stories about artist's private lives, but as far as this personal account of Leonard Bernstein's marriage is concerned, they created a really mesmirising, warmhearted portrait, that left me behind in my seat with goosebumps and in reverence...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb!~imseeg rated 8/10 on 26 November 2023"," Admired it more than I liked it: POSITIVES:1) The two central performances are both absolutely sensational. Both Cooper and Mulligan have some really jaw dropping scenes and they were what kept me engaged throughout2) The direction and cinematography are both superb. There are lots of long takes and clever camerawork and this helped to make certain scenes feel much more impactful, such as the big conducting scene near the end that goes on for several minutes with only a couple of cuts3) Using Bernstein's own pieces as the score for the film was very clever and I loved how over dramatic the score felt a lot of the timeNEGATIVES:1) I really didn't like the first hour or so of this film while it was in black and white. It just felt so pretentious, fake and full of itself. Also, the characters all talk insanely fast for some reason during the black and white scenes. Things did improve once things went to colour though2) As the title of this review states, I felt like the film was more of a technical achievement than something I actually enjoyed watching. I didn't really care about any of the characters, in fact I found Bernstein very unlikeable, and I wasn't really invested in the plot3) As is the case with a lot of biopics, I think this film is guilty of trying to cram an entire person's life into only 2 hours, which makes a lot of things feel very rushed.~DanLawson146 rated 7/10 on 7 December 2023"," Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance: It's a biopic set in New York City between 1943 and the late 1980s. Its primary focus is the relationship and marriage between Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). We learn pretty early that Bernstein's sexual appetites extend to both women and men. An early male relationship is with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). Felicia knows Bernstein's orientation from the beginning but asks that he be discrete. We also meet Bernstein's sister, Shirley (Sarah Silverman), and, especially, he and Felicia's oldest daughter, Jamie (Maya Hawke).The second orientation of ""Maestro"" is Bernstein's difficulty harnessing his expansive skills in composition, conducting, and popular education about music. His extroversion sometimes hinders his ability to focus. The film portrays this issue less effectively.""Maestro"" is an intense and skillfully photographed movie. The cinematography reflects the era being portrayed. Thus, for example, the film is black and white until the 1960s. I cannot comment on the portrayals of Bernstein's conducting or the quality of his compositions, except to note that Bernstein's conducting is very intense. An enormous number of people populate the film, making it difficult to keep track from time to time. That said, Carey Mulligan gives a superb performance that deserves Academy consideration, though some parts of her life are missing, such as her political activism.Cooper's Bernstein is not deep outside the relationship with Felicia that slowly deteriorates. The film omits to mention that Bernstein also had affairs with women during the marriage. The movie portrays Felicia's final illness with breast cancer very effectively and emotionally..~steiner-sam rated 8/10 on 8 December 2023"," I've watched too many of this kind of story, and 'Maestro' isn't an inch different.: A struggling musician agonized by his own genius, talents, and creativity and trapped in loveless marriage filled with guilt. Both look the other way while one has an affair and realize the importance of one's own partner too late. Right now, at the top of my head I can think of 'Fosse/Verdon', 'A Star Is Born', 'George & Tammy', 'Walk the Line', 'Dreamgirls', 'Daisy Jones & The Six', and etc. (Wow, that's a lot.) Biographical genre is especially tricky because it has to excel the life of actual historical figures. 'Maestro' could have been so much better if it delved into the introspective and artistic side of Bernstein deeper or provided a different and fresh point of view on his life rather than reciting his personal life. His autobiography or research would be more fun and interesting than this explanatory movie.There were a few futile attempts to make the movie look more artistic, abstract, and ambiguous. They failed because they serve no purpose but to look pretentious. White and black, camera movement, the use of light and shadows, and musical aspects. They are all good attempts, but for what? By doing so, is the story getting stronger? Do they enhance what viewers feel? Waste of time and films.Bradley Cooper's performance is disappointing. He never acts; he imitates. When he's on the screen, we know clearly that he's acting. It's hard to be absorbed and immersed into the screen because he always pushes the audience away with his trying too hard. I get that he wants to emulate Bernstein's twangy voice. However, emotions and messages he delivers are more important than his likeness of Bernstein's tone, accent, sound, or mannerism. He focuses on what's outside of Bernstein rather than what would be inside of him. There is a 10 minute sequence of Cooper conducting, and it's screaming 'Look how good I am!!!'. It's one of the highest points for emotions to burst out for the audience, and I started to laugh.~TaylorYee94 rated 6/10 on 21 December 2023"," The filmmaking was very good, but I found the story not that interesting.: We don't know much about Leonard Bernstein. We didn't learn why he wanted to be a composer or how he got in the business. His relationship wasn't very clear either. He's bisexual, but that doesn't go anywhere. His wife isn't explained much either other than being a stage actress. We don't know much about his children. The timelines aren't clear when the movie takes place. It seems to start in the 50s other than the opening scene of him as an old man. I do like Bradley Cooper's performance, but not much comes from the character. We don't know what made him famous since he was already famous before his memorable score in On the Waterfront.~MJB784 rated 6/10 on 10 December 2023"," Where's the biography?: Yes, good acting, great music but absolutely no story. At all. Apart from his bisexuality which dominated the script.Bradley Cooper was too greedy in writing, directing and starring. What did he write? Not much of a story. I'd like to have seen Lenny's childhood explicated, more meat on the bare bones offered here.Also, why so little on West Side Story - one brief extract and not the huge explosive hit it was at the time. The adulation which followed.The teasing bits of his Missa were beautiful and far too much of his Mahler, though lovely, had little bearing on the overall story.Brad's prosthetic nose was distracting in that it gave a nasal whiny tone to his dialogue. And he might have done better with another actor.Carey Mulligan, as always was amazing in her role but again, underplayed the distress she must have felt at his infidelity/. At one point he left her for a young (male) lover and only returned when she was diagnosed with cancer. (in her breast, from a broken heart? Who knows)The great man of music was not served well here, far too shallow a treatment of his genius.5/10.~wisewebwoman rated 5/10 on 23 December 2023"," How is it possbile to make Leonard Bernstein uninteresting?: The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper's transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn't a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife's dealing with her husband's bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein's conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn't much left!~fmdead rated 6/10 on 24 December 2023", Too much about his marriage: Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception. Bradley should just have acted and not tried to direct and write the screenplay.~phd_travel rated 5/10 on 21 December 2023
The Iron Claw (2023) - IMDb,8.1,Zac Efron|Jeremy Allen White|Harris Dickinson|Maura Tierney|Holt McCallany|Grady Wilson|Valentine Newcomer|Scott Innes|Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Garrett Hammond|Stanley Simons|Michael Harney|Jullian Dulce Vida|Cazzey Louis Cereghino|Ryan Nemeth|Lily James|Kevin Anton|Michael Papajohn,Sean Durkin,Sean Durkin,"The true story of the inseparable Von Erich brothers, who made history in the intensely competitive world of professional wrestling in the early 1980s."," ""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?"": There's probably no other family in the world of professional wrestling that has endured more pain and sorrow than the Von Erichs of Texas. You might actually extend that dubious distinction to just about any family anywhere. Patriarch Fritz Von Erich (real name John 'Jack' Adkisson) was a big-name star during the Fifties and Sixties, feared for his famous signature finishing move, 'The Iron Claw'. Five of his sons followed his footsteps into a wrestling career with varying degrees of success, or lack thereof. The only one left alive is Kevin, who at a young age, was never explained the death of his six-year-old brother Jackie, the first of the Von Erich children to die an unnatural death by electric shock and drowning.This movie was a whole lot better than I expected it to be. Personally, I lost interest in professional wrestling around the mid-1980's, just around the time the older Von Erichs were making their mark in the field. I knew father Fritz Von Erich to be a dangerous competitor during his era of the Fifties and Sixties, and when in the movie, he complains of not getting the recognition he needed to be elevated to World Heavyweight Champion, one might consider it was his grating personality as an aggressive self-promoter that stood in the way. Holt McCallany was a good choice for Fritz, who he resembled quite closely.Having not followed the entertainment sport for almost forty years now, the chronology of events in this movie challenged me at times, but it was all there. Except for one nagging omission, that being one Von Erich brother missing from the narrative. For the sake of keeping the story constrained within a budget, director Sean Durkin opted to make Mike Von Erich (Stanley Simons) a composite figure of his real-life counterpart and yet another brother, Chris. Had Chris been included, the emotional overload would have been even more grueling, as Chris also committed suicide by gunshot two years before Kerry, portrayed by Jeremy Allen White. Following Chris's suicide, Fritz and Doris Von Erich (Maura Tierney) divorced after three months, an event omitted from the story.Befitting the family's tragic history, the movie's final scene with Kevin (Zac Efron) hugging his two young sons and sorrowfully stating that he's no longer a brother is enough to bring a tear to one's eye. A closing frame of Kevin's present day family of four children and thirteen grandchildren doesn't offer the fact that his two sons, Kevin and David, are currently professional wrestlers themselves. One would certainly hope that the curse of the Von Erichs doesn't extend to the present generation.P. S. - If you would like to go directly to the source, look up the first season episode of ""Dark Side of the Ring: The Last of the Von Erichs"". In it, Kevin Von Erich takes the viewer through the circumstances surrounding the death of each of his brothers. Be prepared for the present-day Kevin, the episode was filmed in 2019. He's a gaunt and almost frail looking individual with a subdued and composed manner when speaking about his father and brothers.~classicsoncall rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," One of the Best Films of 2023. Zac Efron, Best Actor in a Generational Performance. Equal Parts 20th Century American Success Story and Timeless American Tragedy: This is one of the greatest wrestling movies ever made. Certainly the greatest true wrestling story ever made.This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made.But you need to know nothing about wrestling nor of this famous wrestling family to absorb the absolute impact that this movie will have on you inside the theater.This carries the same weight, pound for pound, as the fabulous Elvis movie did a year or so ago.This movie also magnificently captures that wonderful and amazing era of life before the internet and social media.Where real feats of strength, endurance and physical athleticism had to be either witnessed in person and seen with one's own eyes, or on some small screen somewhere.Legends were made inside a ring in tiny arenas and gymnasiums on this country's soil. And their images were then plastered on paper in magazines that covered the racks at the local drug store or grocery store.And it was every bit as influential as anything that one could possibly find on their phones today.This is an unbelievable and incredible tale.Everyone should know the Von Erichs.They will after seeing this.~RightOnDaddio rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," Heartbreaking Cursed Family: The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.~statuskuo rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"," An emotionally haunting film: The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy. I found myself heartbroken by the tragedies portrayed on screen, yet incredibly moved by the brotherhood these characters shared.

I am not very familiar with the Von Erich backstory but the movie does a pretty good job on examining the characters and setting with strong directing from Durkin which helped bring the atmosphere and setting to the heights. The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times.

Aside from that, I went into this movie completely blind; I'm not a wrestling fan and I didn't research anything about the Von Erichs before seeing this.This film is so tragic that I found myself astounded by the fact that it was based on a true story. It feels like something out of a Greek tragedy or Stephen King novel. Unfortunately, it's neither: this is the story of an obsessive and unfeeling man who forced his failed dreams onto each of his sons ... and the catastrophes it caused...Everyone who talks about ""The Iron Claw"" is going to rave about how great of a job Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White are in this (and don't get me wrong, they're PHENOMENAL), but I was especially blown away by Harris Dickinson's portrayal of David Von Erich; he carried every scene he was in with a larger-than-life, yet supportive persona.""The Iron Claw"" is more than good enough to earn a couple of Oscar nominations next year ... but based on the recently released shortlist and strong competition, I doubt it's going to make it.Regardless, I still recommend this unbelievable and emotional movie.

I thought this would be a typical sports movie centered around wrestling. Fortunately, this film was more than that. It touched on many topics like brotherhood, father son dynamics and grief. This film was way more tragic than anything I could have thought of and what makes it crazy is that it's all true.The acting was very good in this film and all the relationships were believable except for how quickly Kevin and Pam got together.All of the actors playing the brothers had great chemistry. The motives and decisions of all the characters were well executed. The wrestling scenes were well done even though this film was less about wrestling and more about the family.While I enjoyed this film, I did feel that it could have been longer. Some of the events felt rushed and crammed together. More major wrestling events should have been added to show some of the wrestling politics. The wives in the film played very minimal roles in the film and it was hard to believe that they weren't more involved in real life.With that said this was still a gripping and memorable film that deserves to be watched.~moviemanmo rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"

Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.," A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.: One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 8/10 on 20 July 2023"," Murphy is exceptional: You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.~Orlando_Gardner rated 9/10 on 19 July 2023"," Quality but exhausting: I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.~Bonobo13579 rated 7/10 on 21 July 2023"," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws: ""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.~MrDHWong rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!: This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!~and_mikkelsen rated 10/10 on 20 July 2023"," Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short: I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.~Geekofriendly rated 8/10 on 26 July 2023"," A Masterpiece: I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.~mohameddawoud-26019 rated 10/10 on 19 July 2023"," And the Oscar goes to...: I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.~mark-217-307033 rated 10/10 on 19 July 2023"," Is it just me ?: Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.~pdean-49132 rated 8/10 on 21 July 2023"," Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way: Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.~timmyhollywood rated 6/10 on 23 July 2023"

Instead of going for a conventional underdog story it's a much more intense, more interesting film that shows how masculinity and ambition desensitise someone to the tragedy that surrounds them.Adam Driver delivers a performance that may not be in the upper tier of his work but this is still terrific stuff, and the accent is better here than in House of Gucci. His inability to process his own grief hangs over the whole film, the fact that he couldn't fix it clearly eats at him all the time and the one outburst it builds to is glorious.Penélope Cruz is given a role that is usually pretty thankless in this genre and does so much. She is terrifying without saying a word and holds a lot of power. Shailene Woodley on the other hand, isn't given much to do and her accent isn't consistent and yet she's still good enough to prevent that from being a major distraction.Michael Mann's direction gets just as close to the racing as it does to Adam Driver's stern face. The racing sequences themselves are electric, by getting as close as possible, the speed and danger are definitely felt. It all culminates in a horrifying crash in which the lack of sound makes it even more impactful.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Could have been a lot better: For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough.~ethanbresnett rated 6/10 on 23 December 2023"," Everyone Versus Ferrari: It's 1957 and Enzo Ferrari, as portrayed by Adam Driver, has a lot on his mind. His wife (Penelope Cruz) is mad with grief over the death of their son; his mistress, Shailene Woodley, wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed; he's hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed, and he's distracted by his movie-star girlfriend; and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner, which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousand-mile Mille Miglia. Also, Orsi over at Maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racers.Michael Mann is not known for character studies. His subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side, so this movie about Ferrari is a natural fit. The script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are, and they keep increasing throughout the movie, while Adam Driver lets down his guard with no one one, and Miss Cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks. I am not fond of movies about racing, since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroom-vroom sounds from their audio libraries. However, this movie makes clear that Ferrari's one real passion is racing cars, and it's a series of real crises that he has to overcome. Considering the negligible story content of so many of this year's ""For your consideration"" titles, I'll say that it's easily worth your time in the theater seat.~boblipton rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," Nice mixture of car racing and family drama can entertain assortment of viewers. Beforehand I was afraid that car racing would use up most running time, but I stand corrected: Saw this at the 2023 filmfestival Ghant (Belgium). Obviously, the main topic is cars and car races, but there is also a mixture of family drama (illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir, woman with money prepared to invest, and so on) to make it compatible for family viewing. Actually, you can consider it two films, nicely intermixed with another. The car race fans will find plenty to watch, and the rest of the film moves the family story forward. Implicitly we know that the story ends well; this is no spoiler, given that the name Ferrari still exists as a car brand.Nice details in abundance. Drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate. When drivers bring their girlfriends along, the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women, to the dismay of Ferrari. He asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world, letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it, playing the cards for a business deal. And there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare, who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the company.All in all, I did not regret booking tickets, although I feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu. My fears were unjustified. There is ample family and relational drama to keep everyone's attention, and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience.~JvH48 rated 8/10 on 16 November 2023"," Ironically Slow Given The Subject Matter: Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.~cdjh-81125 rated 5/10 on 18 December 2023", Stylish biopic with strong characters and great performances: Watched Ferrari on the closing night of NYFF 61. Great to see the return of Michael Mann after 8 years.Tells the story of Enzo Ferrari and the world of Italian fast car racing both from a personal and professional angle. The glamour of fast cars and their fearless drivers juxtaposed against the mortal risk they take as they try to excel in their field.The personal life to Enzo trying to balance his powerful and strong wife Laura played by Penelope and his love and mother of his surviving son Lina played by Shailene is a treat to watch. Strong performances from all the 3 leads and a special callout for Penelope for her portrayal of Laura.~rakeshroy31 rated 9/10 on 15 October 2023," I Was Expecting More...: Have only seen this advertised a couple of times but was sort of intrigued as to what sort of film it would be. The trailers didn't exactly sell it to me & didn't exactly excite me in any way. But as I said, I was intrigued & of course was able to see this ahead of the UK Boxing Day release via a Limitless Membership.Set in the summer of 1957, with Enzo Ferrari's auto empire in crisis, the ex-racer turned entrepreneur pushes himself & his drivers to the edge as they launch into the Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy.I found the film to be quite mundane for the most part. The story & sub plots were confusing & the film was hard to follow. The racing & crashes were good, & with a bit of eye candy, it just about got you through the overly long 2 hours & 7 minute runtime.The casting is not bad, but could've been better & like the film, could've used some meaty impact. The film looks & feels tired as it plods along & of course, you find yourself not caring & your mind wandering. The pacing is also off in this flick too.I was more expecting the film to be about the orgins of Enzo's life, like how he worked his way up sort of thing & most importantly, to be easier to follow & be more concise in its story-telling, which this film failed on all forms.Overall, don't expect much from this flick. The film really is as mundane as the trailer is & if that doesn't make you think twice, I don't know what will. This film is ok, but could've been better, much, much better.5/10.~vengeance20 rated 5/10 on 19 December 2023"," 7 1/2 stars, really... Penelope Cruz was amazing!: Saw this at the Viennale in Vienna today.Penelope Cruz is a gem as Laura. Woodley somehow plays the same character in everything she's cast in. I think she's got talent, but how can you tell at this point? Driver was okay. The bad accents by the American actors took a while getting used to, but at 135min, there is plenty time for that.The real stars were the cars and the driving scenes of course - and they were absolutely stunning!I'm not a big action movie person, but these scenes were so well done, I'd get into the Fast & Furious franchise if it was done by this crew.As far as the story goes: it's well done, there is enough meat there in Enzo's personal life and the goings-on around the infamous '57 Mille Miglia that audiences who aren't only going for the car race will be satisfied.But Penelope Cruz carries the non-car-stuff on her shoulders, really. She's a powerhouse actress and for some reason I seem to forget it time and time again until I see another movie with her in it and am surprised at how good she is. I shouldn't be surprised - nobody should be. She's always great... but here, she's at the top of her game.~Cacahuate86 rated 8/10 on 24 October 2023"," A most welcome return for a brilliant director: When I heard this was coming out I was very excited, not so much because I'm a fan of this or any other brand of car but simply because it has been so long since my man Mann had helmed a theatrical release. That being said, I'll admit that going in and coming out of this, I retain my positive bias for the director. And with THAT being said, I'll point out what I didn't like first, just to be fair.The pacing of Ferrari felt off and made it feel longer than its running time as the film stumbled around its themes, almost afraid to commit to any one of them. To me, this was a fairly mundane procedural biopic that flashed moments of potential through some very clever dialogue, performed to near perfection by its leads. What other critics have written rang true initially- I didn't walk out feeling like I actually had enough of a glimpse inside the head of the man behind the brand and what made him tick and if I had just left it at that I'd have given the movie a lower rating.However...I starting asking myself, ""how much more of a glimpse would I need that would justify this character's actions and decisions any more than was already depicted?"" And the answer I came to was that I actually did understand why he acted and reacted to everything that occurred in the story. If I wasn't careful, I could have easily fallen into that ""unimpressed"" spiral where no amount of psychoanalysis was enough, thus hamstringing my enjoyment of what is actually a really good movie. We will never fully know anybody, no matter how much we learn about them, and armed with that notion, I realized Enzo's character study held a mystique akin to Mann's brilliant depiction of Ali.Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz were seminal and both deserve Oscar nods, whatever that's worth these days (I'm still confused and have thoughts on why Will Smith lost out to Denzel for best actor way back when). The camera work and cinematography was true-to-form perfect, the drama was affecting and THAT crash scene was the first time I'd gasped in a theatre since I don't know when.In my humble opinion, Ferrari is a triumphant return for a prodigal auteur and I really hope it spells the beginning of more releases from one of my very favourite directors.Ps: so many critics have accused Mann for his general inability to harness drama in his films that I wonder if they have ever seen The Insider.~tpetroi rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Tedious, just so boring: 2 hours I'll never get back, I think the challenge is to see if you can stay awake for the whole film!The trailer did a good job at fooling you into thinking would be interestingAdam Driver was far too wooden and you never really felt any empathy with the character and just grew to dislike him more & more as you got to know more about him, as an advertising platform for Ferrari it failed although that wasn't its remit.Comparing this to Ford v Ferrari which had a much better script and was enjoyable to watch , this just plodded along and never really started , there was no excitement & no emotionMichael Mann had directed some great films like Heat & Collateral but this is probably his worst piece of work to date.~Padreviews rated 4/10 on 18 December 2023"

Smith,"A 1930s-set story centered on the University of Washington's rowing team, from their Depression-era beginnings to winning gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics."," Wonderful motion picture, but do read the book!: We waited so long for this movie to be made, ever since Daniel James Brown wrote the story. A serendipitous set of events led to the story even being recorded, as Judy Rantz Willman just happened to have Daniel James Brown as a neighbor, and eventually persuaded Brown to visit her father, who was in hospice care. What he thought was a social visit, she saw as a book about to be written. His initial skepticism evaporated quickly, when Joe began sharing his story. In Joe's remaining couple of months of life, Brown met with Rantz several times to begin creating the outline for the book. He then met with the families of the other crew members, followed by two years of further research, aided by Judy Rantz. The eight were amazing people, accustomed to hardship and personal challenges. For example, when Don Hume's family moved from Anacortes to Olympia, Don tossed his belongings into a rowboat and paddled down Puget Sound to his new home, roughly 100 miles away. Look at a map! A multiple-sport letterman in high school, he had also placed third in a state pianist's competition. And Joe Rantz was such a standout athlete in gymnastics at Roosevelt High School, that Coach Ulbrickson already had his eye on him then. So, what did we miss in the movie? Joe's difficult pre-college life is mostly absent, and worth the read by itself. We also miss Joe's wanderings around Berlin, where he witnesses Germany's horrific treatment of its Jewish population, under its totalitarian leader. Like nearly everything from Hollywood, a bit of romance is thrown in to add spice, but the story shines, throughout the picture. Here and there a bit of drama is added for effect, but personalities presented by the actors conform closely with who they represented. George Pocock really was the sage he seemed in the movie. Don Hume comes across as a bit socially awkward in the movie. A good friend met him several years ago where she worked, and described him as, uh, gruff. The fearless audacity of the team comes through in a story told only in the book. Before sailing to Germany for the Olympics, the team decides to drop in, unannounced, on Franklin Roosevelt at his home. Although they didn't find the president at home, they did spend the evening there. The story behind this movie is too remarkably wonderful to be fiction. See the movie, but by all means read the book!~rob-87379 rated 9/10 on 25 December 2023"," Great story, but poor direction / writing: The story is incredible, so I was surprised how flat the movie was. Yes, you get some feel-good moments, but there were so many missed opportunities to make this a truly great movie. The narrative leaves a lot of loose ends that prevent us from connecting with the characters. The actors did their best with what was given, but I really wanted to know more about each character. There were also some shockingly cheesy elements - the intro and ending were completely superfluous, and just lame. The music score was corny and dated. The Boys in the Boat is worth watching once, but if you want the real story, read the book.~gaigeredd rated 6/10 on 28 December 2023"," Predictably uplifting: ... Merrily, merrily, merrily,Life is but a dream ...A huge bestseller when it was published in 2013, Daniel James Brown's ""The Boys in the Boat"" was a big hit in my circle of friends. The kind of book that gets recommended, if not passed around, pal to pal.Set in the '30s it was the true story of the University of Washington junior varsity rowing team who not only gunned down the storied, legacy crews of California and Ivy League colleges, but went on to the 1936 Olympics in Adolf Hitler's Berlin. It was an adrenalized page turner, a movie waiting to happen.Now that it's getting to the screen, it helps to have George Clooney in the director's chair. Although he stays offscreen, the double-Oscar-winning actor, producer and director is the biggest name on the project.It's his face - generally recognized as one of the coolest guys on the planet - in many of the production stills and the ""for your consideration"" ads targeted at industry voters this awards season. George and co-producer Grant Heslov also took part in a recent Zoom press conference for the film along with cast members Joel Edgerton, who stars as taciturn coach Al Ulbrickson; Callum Turner, who plays team member Joe Rantz; and Hadley Robinson, who lights up the screen as Joe's sweetheart, Joyce.Opening in theaters Christmas Day, it's a feel-good throwback to old-fashioned moviemaking.Taking place during the Great Depression, the scrappy kids at their oars offered glimpses of optimism and hope, rare commodities in those tough times. Rowing was a popular spectator sport in that pre-ESPN era with spectators lining river banks and in some cases following the action in train cars on the shore keeping pace with the sleek 8-man wooden shells slicing through the water.Not just an incredibly demanding sport, rowing was a culture, too. The rowing world was made of wood - not just the glossy racing shells, but also their big-doored, high-ceilinged boat houses. You can almost smell the resins and varnish coming from the boathouse surrounded by lush forest on the Seattle campus.As the team keeps achieving more success, the gorgeous historically recreated settings move, first to colleges on the East Coast before heading for swastika-adorned Germany. Legendary speedster Jesse Owens was another member of the U. S. Olympic team that year. During the press conference Clooney acknowledged borrowing camera angles from Hitler's propagandist Leni Riefenstahl for the climactic Olympic rowing scenes.""We like to use Nazis whenever we can for filming,"" he joked.The mood was light during the Zoom press conference, now that the film was in the can and the cast's arduous training was long past.London-born actor Turner, whose Joe Rantz is as close as the eight-man team can get to having a hero, acknowledged that he hadn't had any previous rowing experience.""None of us had actually. And we turn up in February, and we get on the river. And it's snowing. And we're all in the tight shorts and freezing cold and have no skill at being in the boat. And after about three weeks, George and Grant come down to have a look and check in on us. We weren't in a good place. And I could see the pain behind the smile on George's face.""""That wasn't pain. That was fear,"" corrected Heslov.The boys on the real team hadn't had any experience, either. For Joe and several teammates, making the team - beating the scores of hopefuls for the eight seats (plus the coxswain) - meant getting room and board at the university.Unlike Ivy Leaguers born to the sport, the junior Huskies were rough hewn. ""They were lumberjacks,"" said Clooney. They came together as a team ""out of necessity, out of hunger, out of having nothing else.""The actors trained together for five months. Unlike their competitors in the film in new fiberglass shells, their boat, the Huskie Clipper, was made of wood like the original. Beyond just acting, there was a sense of athletic accomplishment for Turner and his teammates.""The hardest part about rowing is that you all have to be in complete unison,"" said the actor. ""There's no, like, hiding. And if one person is out by a millimeter, the boat suffers.""For his part, Clooney faced a different set of challenges.""The oars are, you know, 15 feet long. And then the boats are 40-some feet long. So, you can't get close to the boats with the camera. And you can't get side by side or ahead of the boats with your camera boat, 'cause you'll capsize the boat. So, we had to come up with a design to get in tight enough to make it exciting. Meaning, we're on an 80-foot arm on the boat with a 300-millimeter lens, 200-millimeter lens, down low, getting wet, trying to hold focus while you're doing that. So, there was a ton of, like, math to try to make those things exciting.""On top of that, neither Joe Rantz or Coach Ulbrickson were especially loquacious. They were men of action rather than words. On the printed page this is no big deal. On the big screen it can be. Hadley Robinson's feistiness along with her beauty, and Courtney Henggeler's portrayal of the coach's wife, Hazel, go a long way to humanizing their male partners.In a key scene, Joe and Joyce share what Clooney called ""a 1940s movie kiss"" - in a train station, no less. In a way, ""The Boys in the Boat"" itself is a 1940s movie. It's beautiful to look at, it wears its heart on its sleeve. It comes from an era when wholesome was cool. Standing up and cheering was nothing to be embarrassed by.But the psychological reserve of its characters played better on the page than they do on the screen.Despite Clooney's assured direction and the unbreakable spirit of the cast, neither the predictable script nor the soft sentiments of Alexandre Desplat musical score produce the irrepressible ""Chariots of Fire"" sorts of emotions that spell the difference between good sports movies and great ones.~rickchatenever rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," The Cultural Significance of Sports in America: Clooney hits the mark beautifully with this film. This is a story about a ragtag group of boys who come together to unify a nation despite the circumstances around it. A story that hard work will beat talent when talent fails to work hard. This movie didn't have the marketing of Aquaman or Wonka but the story is compelling and well told. Edgerton is great, as is the rest of cast. This movie will get you on your feet and make you feel proud to be an American (if you are one). To me, this movie illustrates, similar to Miracle, Remember the Titans or Rocky (albeit fictional) that nothing is more culturally significant to Americans than sports. Consider watching it yourself if you're down for a feel good movie.~qdmqvq rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," The story of US!: The story was enough. It showed what we are capable of when we are hungry and determined. No excuses, no quitting-do your best and that is usually enough. The actors were believable and worked hard to be able to be on the boat-no faking it. Loved the camera work, showing perfectly the race from above. Great job!Our country has been through extreme difficult times. The depiction of The Great Depression proves to us how the spirit of unity and relentless work can help us overcome any situation. We need this spirit today, more than ever, as our country faces division and contempt for those that disagree with our position. The American eagle, our symbol of grace and strength, inspires me. That beautiful bird must have a right and a left wing to fly. Let's protect and respect our diversity and freedom of opinion, today and always.~marialucgom rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Hands down favorite movie of 2023!: What an amazing movie!I actually forgot that I was in the movie theater and found myself clapping and cheering with each race!The entire ensemble was perfectly cast! I must say, I can't pick a favorite character or actor, each one held their own with an outstanding performance.Though based in Seattle, this movie is not just for the Husky alumni to enjoy. I was incredibly moved by Cal's role in the non-fiction story.Everyone worked together to make America extremely proud during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany.Definitely watch and support this movie. It's absolutely worth the price of a ticket and popcorn; you'll definitely want to watch this one at the theater.~tabathastewart rated 10/10 on 25 December 2023"," Time To Row This Boat Ashore To The Nearest Theater: Likes:Pace-It's a movie about racing boats via rowing, and it could be awesome, or it could be boring, depending on how many elements they try to explore.-Boys in the Boat turns out to be the entertaining pace for me, a beautiful mashup of character development Disney elements, with the pace of an Olympic event.-It lays out the grounds, puts the stakes at hand, and then hits water skimming to keep the stone going until it reaches the other side.-A startling balance, I really had little time to be bored when the movie just kept my attention in these boys' journey, and how good it felt to go on the ride.Humor-The Humor may not be the most knee slapping or bust a gut moment I've seen, but it holds instead something else I appreciate.-Balance. Clooney and his team wrote a great movie that integrates laughs into the mix, but not to the point of breaking character or going too far out of the way.-More about the execution, this movie accomplished much with just being real people and finding the right moment to throw a comedy punch that hit hard.Acting-Another fine community coming together to craft a world, there were few people in this movie that felt fake or too forced for a performance.-Guinness was a fantastic mentor role, wise, cunning, but still approachable, holding a look and delivery that just needed more time to simmer than we got. I really enjoyed his chemistry with two of the actors and felt he was one of the most cinematic moments of the movie.-Turner's performance it fantastic, a wonderful blend of that heartthrob story, with a touch of O. C. meeting the Remember The Titans presentation. A fantastic blend, he helps really anchor the story, brining love, honor, and struggles to the mix to help go along the lines of the racing. By far the character with the most investment, he had a lot on his shoulders to make it believable.-And Edgerton continues to take those harder roles and sell them with that panache he has brought many times. Calm, collected, but motivational, he has some of the more monumental quotes of the movie and he make it look darn good too.Settings/Recreation-Going back into the 1930s, you have to have the look and fell, and Hollywood continues to have those resources to make the past the present.-Fantastic buildings and schools hold that old world charm, window apparel, the cars, and the accessories all culminating in the look of the house and business at the time.Not enough? The movie flourishes in flaunting the times of the old with how they advertised the event, using radio, newspaper, and the occasional theater preview to further immerse one into the mix.-Add in the clothes and the use of the old-time music machines with the Big Band numbers, and you accomplish much to bring you back to the past and enrich the experience even further.Cinematography-Beautiful coordination by the camera team brough to life this story and helped add that immersion experience to my viewing.-Nothing stupendous in regards to most of the non-boating moments, we had stable work, dynamic angles, and just the right shot to get the moment.-Once the boat races start up though, that was the best camera work of the bunch, the ingraining of every possible shot imaginable edited together in beautiful collaboration.-On the boat, the rowers, the competition, and the crowd, all blended into each race to help build up the momentum and unleash that spectacle that feels both real and Hollywood magic.-I loved seeing the sides, feeling the integration of America and help bring that emotional aspect to the full brim.The Hope-I think something this movie did, that many others have failed to do, is just how motivated I was at the end.-Not to row, but to push hard and discipline myself to handle the problems that face me. Boys in the Boat is that feel good movie, that doesn't have to preach or go too hard to get the message across.-I loved the way the training felt difficult, but natural, alongside seeing just what these small victories brought to the country.-Seeing development of the characters and situations without being bombarded by political lines and out of the way antics to highlight only further impressed me with how Clooney made a good movie.-Sure, it's a tad cliché at times, but props to once again a victory in taking that emotional gamble. Wow.The Boat Races-And all of this comes in those boat races that incorporate so much to really feel worth the investment.-Fantastic pacing and that quick sensation are the start, providing a foundation that feels very much like ng event.-Then you take all those tricks of camera, a dynamic, fast-paced change up edited together to make the event even more engaging, incorporating so many elements to help ensnare you into the moment.-Add the music with the commentary, and the movie just manages to make some of the best sporting shots I've seen in a long while, really making these moments the climactic elements they wanted it to be.DISLIKES:More Time With Characters-Despite all the good though, a lot of the rowers are going to be forgettable, because they don't really get much time to shine in the movie.-Some characters have their unique qualities, but many are kind of just feeling like extras, there to row, and nothing more, which given how ""united"" they were... sort of ironic in this flaw.-Obviously they can't do what they did for the main characters for 7 guys and keep it within reasonable time, but Remember the Titans shows how to balance other characters better than this film. So that would have been nice.A Tad Rushed At Parts-Other moments feel very rushed, the family life of the coach, the struggles with the rower's living situation, even the recruitment all feel a bit blunt and lacking the finesse.-Throw in the buildup to the races in the Olympics even felt very back-to-back. Not sure if that happened in real life, but I really felt that some of the montages just felt a bit fast forwarded in their presentation. Oh well, they at least optimized the exciting times and made good use of the cuts.Predictable-If you know the story and heard the trailers, you lose some of the edge of this movie.-It's exciting to see the journey, but with the knowledge about what happens with this team, you can be assured that the spark is missing a bit in terms of what will happen.-Fortunately, the presentation is so on point that it overtakes and minimize the predictable factor, and as most people in my audience showed, a lot of clapping still came out with this movie.The VERDICT:The Boys In the Boat is by far one of the better sports movies to grace the theaters in a very long time. Like Remember The Titans, the movie knows how to really inspire without becoming too cheesy, and knows how to cover a lot of plots in a small amount of time. Clooney directed his cast well, all teams helping to bring us back in time, integrate fantastic settings, and bring about that slice of history that you need for a movie like this. Throw in talented actors to craft the team to deliver some well-crafted dialogue and you only further help match the feeling I got with Disney era films from the past. Yet it's the boating scenes that make this movie theater worthy, so many elements teased and combined to unleash the most epic moments for me this holiday season. These scenes are not only fun and engaging to watch, but inspire the message of hope and motivation they promised in the trailers. Sure, there were a lot of things to balance and improve on, but the spectacle is enough to help weather the storm and buffer some of these dislikes.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Sport: 8.5Movie Overall: 7.5.~rgkarim rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Great 2 hours: I loved book, I saw the PBS documentary, but was sorry to see early poor reviews for this film. Saw a promo on tv that it was opening on Christmas Day, and snagged a seat, but I had very little expectation that it would be good. Boy, was I wrong! This film held my attention fully, and given the terrible nature of our society right now, it was a total breath of fresh air to be transported to another time and place. Not since Indiana Jones have I felt so fully ensconced in The Great Depression, by the beautiful cinematography, perfect costuming, and fine acting depicting the sheer difficulty of just surviving in the US then. I understand some poignant issues for Joe Rantz needed to be removed from the movie due to time constraints, but all are easily accessible to anyone wanting more information. In short, I have a newfound respect for George Clooney, who made a very fine film.~sharonbach rated 8/10 on 27 December 2023"," olympic inspiration: Greetings again from the darkness. It's always disappointing when a book is so interesting and enjoyable to read, only to be followed up by a movie version that doesn't live up to the source material. My son recommended the 2013 best-selling non-fiction novel from Daniel James Brown, and it was truly fascinating to read such an inspirational story around the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Of course, we all know the Jesse Owens story, yet somehow the remarkable and unlikely tale of the University of Washington crew team never received the publicity it earned. Director George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, 2015) and screenwriter Mark L Smith (THE REVENANT, 2015) have attempted to reach a wider audience by adapting Brown's book for the big screen.The story begins in Seattle during the Great Depression. Engineering student Joe Rantz (an excellent Callum Turner, EMMA., 2020) is behind on his tuition and has had no luck securing work. We learn Joe has been on his own for years, and has remained focused on his education despite living in such poverty that he frequently goes without meals and uses folded newspapers to keep dirt and moisture out of the hole in his shoe sole. His buddy Roger (Sam Strike) informs him of crew tryouts, and a spot on the JV team comes with a job and stipend. No-nonsense coach Al Ulbrickson (Joel Edgerton) isn't much for motivational speeches and lets the rookies know most won't survive the training to claim one of the eight seats on the boat.Contradictory arguments can be made that director Clooney either took on too much of the story, or not enough. The result is a middling movie about an incredibly inspirational story of underdogs reaching the highest levels of achievement. Included here are only brief glimpses of the personal life of Coach Ulbrickson and his pertinent past, the motivation and wisdom of boat maker George Pocock (screen vet Peter Guiness), and the blossoming romance between Joe and Joyce (up and coming Hadley Robinson, LITTLE WOMEN, 2019). However, the biggest gap here is the connection and camaraderie between Joe and his teammates. The importance of working together ""as one"" is preached, but we aren't privy to how this happened so quickly. Skimming over this is the film's major flaw, as that bond is the key to their growth and success. By the end of the film, most will only recall Joe's name and two or three other faces on the team.The racing scenes on the water were surely challenging to film, and come across as realistic, even though we know these are actors and not world class athletes. The rich versus poor element is touched on, as are the politics which, yes, even existed in sports 90 years ago. Initially it's the newcomers against legendary coach Ky Ebright (Glenn Wrage) and his favored team from Cal, and then it becomes the blue-collar Washington boys against the Ivy League elites ... before heading to Berlin. The Olympics give us swastikas, a cheesy meet between the boys and Jessie Owens, and Daniel Philpott reprising his portrayal as Hitler from ""The Crown"", only with more outlandish mannerisms.The radio broadcasts provide a nostalgic look of how challenging it was to keep up with things during the era, and the newsreels are another nice touch. For those who have never been part of a crew, the term coxswain is likely a new one, and Clooney includes actual photos of the team over the closing credits. The memorable quote is ""We were never eight, we were one"", but for some reason director Clooney thought it a good idea to have a lame framing device set in more modern times around this historic tale. Somehow, we don't feel the adrenaline rush we should during this movie as it falls short of Oscar winner CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981), perhaps the film that Clooney was attempting to mimic.Opening in theaters nationwide on December 25, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 6/10 on 26 December 2023"," Solid Christmas Time Family Sports Uplifter: It seems to have been a very long time since we had a sports movie where it's purely about the sport and the drive to excel to the highest level. Not that movies that add social commentary are poor or unnecessary, but sometimes it's nice to just have a movie where you can sit on the edge of your seat and watch the main characters work as hard as they can to try and achieve their dreams. If you can ignore some of its faults it is an excellent choice for the entire family to enjoy.As for some of its leading issues in my view: A lot of the characters and scenes are poorly developed or not connected properly. For example, we don't really see the boys characters develop a bond outside of a couple parties.The relationship with Joe and his girlfriend has an awkwardness to it and never receives a proper conclusion due to wasting screen time elsewhere.We have the inclusion of some scenes that are included that don't really naturally slide into the story or could be eliminated in favor of other needed elements to develop the characters more.The film also lacks a really outstanding performance. The film must have lacked a bit of a budget. An actor like Tom Hanks as the coach could have elevated it a lot more. Lastly another annoying part was a couple of the tacky scenes included. I'm not sure they even needed Hitler for the movie to work, and most definitely if they were going to include him could have put a bit more into the costume and appearance. I've watched a lot of shows and movies with fake Hitler actors and the one in this movie is without a doubt the worst.But again, if you don't knit pick and want something where you can just enjoy an uplifting film this is a great pick. It's a very difficult movie to dislike. Made for an enjoyable family Boxing Day.~ThereelscoopwithKK rated 7/10 on 27 December 2023"

I had to put my popcorn on the ground because it felt inappropriate to eat popcorn while watching this movie. I even felt wrong laying down in my recliner chair, so I moved it in an upright position. This movie holds a great deal of gravity. It's heaviness is devastating, and if you let it, it could flip your world upside down. The whole point of the film is to flip your world, because unfortunately we merely go about life as if these atrocities aren't happening. This movie will try and wake you up to the sick reality of child trafficking. I reckon it will be successful. It's incredibly well done, has a fantastic compelling script, for having little budget on the actor scene, I'd say it's performances were beyond excellent. Even had some real artistically beautiful shots.Great film with an incredibly powerful message.See this movie. Have your friends and family see this movie. Share it with all. Movies as important as this come once in a decade.Let it flip your world.Let it flip the world.~JackRJosie rated 10/10 on 5 July 2023"," Powerful & Important: This was a tough movie to watch. It wasn't graphic, but to see, to an extent, what Tim Ballard saw, really hits right in the heart. The children in the movie were phenomenal actors is helping to understand the innocence and fear that one would go through in being in that situation.My heart went out to each one of them, yet still hurts knowing that they are just actors and there are actual children being sold everyday.There is a great understanding of what Tim Ballard went through to save the children he did. The sacrifice. The pain, and the darkness that lies within the hearts of people that would take children and destroy their souls and lives.I give this movie a high rating because it wasn't just a good movie, it was a wake up call to all people that there are atrocities occurring everyday towards children and it needs to stop. I appreciate everything this movie sets out to accomplish and it was so well done. It wasn't graphic, but it told the story that needed to be told the way it needed to be told.~3DForMe rated 10/10 on 5 July 2023"," Powerful: Powerful story about an impossibly difficult topic. Beautifully shot, incredibly compelling, amazing performances (the kids!!!!), gorgeous set design, and that it's based on a true story makes it even better.Jim Caviezel is incredible in his role as is Bill Camp. I really wish Mira Sorvino had a bigger part as her character is strong and such an encourager (maybe the next movie will be about Tim's wife? I don't want to give it away - but she's a hero too!)Bravo to the filmmakers for shining a light on a topic that I'm sure most people don't realize just how big this issue is.It's an action thriller with a big call to action. Go see it - then go be a part of the solution!~loriincali rated 9/10 on 1 July 2023"," I don't want to believe it, but I do.: Every parent's worst nightmare is a reality for some. How is that possible?! This is a hard reality to address. I admire Tim Ballard and James Caviezel's dedication to this plight. Caviezel did an amazing acting job-as always. Was I uncomfortable during parts of the movie? I was, and everyone should be!! There is nothing graphic, but you understand what's happening. We need to be more aware of these things and be watchful and alert with our own children and all children!! For this reason I recommend that you see this movie. It will help us all to be more vigilant. Beyond that, it was entertaining and held our attention for what is usually considered a very long movie.~tresadawn rated 10/10 on 1 June 2023"," A fantastic movie that I'll never watch again: After I watched Sound of Freedom, I felt the same as having just watched The Road. It was a deeply powerful movie, but the subject matter is so disturbing that it's difficult to bear it.Sound of Freedom is an expertly shot, gripping, and powerful movie. At the end, I wanted to cry and vomit, yet those are not criticisms of the movie, it's the realization that this sickness actually happens every day all over the world. This movie is The Road + Taken, and amped up 500 times.Jim Cavezel gives an incredible performance. The directing, pacing, and cinematography are perfect. This is definitely one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen, yet I'll probably never watch it again, because my heart won't be able to take it.~notagardeningchannel rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"," So heartbreaking and powerful: This is an absolute must see! Whether you have kids or not, makes no difference this movie is for everyone. If you have children, I suggest you have them watch with you because everybody needs to wake up to what is going on in this world! AN's children need to be very aware of their surrounding. I know it's scary, but better safe than sorry IMO. Im sad to know that in our country, of these United States, we are some of the worlds worst! Although this movie is absolutely heartbreaking, it also gives you a little bit of hope. Because we know God is with us, but also we know there are some really good people out there trying to make a change. Putting their lives on the line, putting their families in danger whether it be because their mom or dad is not coming home because they lay their life on the line to save somebody else's child, or they're made as cops/informants and families are killed. They are all heroes! I wondered as I was sitting in the theater watching this movie...in the two hours I was there I wondered how many children were trafficked or how many were sexually abused. It is absolutely heartbreaking and it is very real.~cscott2331 rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"," Do You Hear That?: ""Sound of Freedom"" is based on the true story of Tim Ballard as he tries to rescue abducted children from sex traffickers. The movie was produced by ""Angel Studios"", and actually was made back in 2018 but faced a number of delays and finally saw the light of day in 2023.It is important to be able to separate the theme of a movie, with the quality of the movie. I am 100% in agreement with the movie's message. Child slavery is an awful thing and this great evil should be stamped out. But that isn't the question, the question is: How is the movie? It is pretty good.It is a very tightly edited, there is not a wasted minute of screen time. It is very well acted, from Cavizel to the children, there was not a performance in the film that I didn't believe. The music was also good, it set up the suspense and enhanced the action.Don't be fooled by the marketing and genre, I wouldn't really consider this film an ""action movie"". It is much more a drama. They do a good job with suspense, but for the most part it is more focused on the depth of the situation. When they do action, it isn't all that well edited. But I do understand, that is not the focus of the film.The movie also loses me as it approaches its final act. Most of the film felt grounded and real, it is based on a true story after all. But then the movie adds a bonus scene, that feels like it is from a different film. It may have happened in real life, I am just saying in the film, it felt out of place.Overall, it is a really good film. I am glad it is doing well. I like seeing some lower budget films get a chance to shine, and I do think it has an important message to share. Let freedom ring.~JayWolfgramm rated 7/10 on 9 August 2023"," Go see it!: I was able to watch a screening of this film and WOW! It was powerful, eye-opening, heart-wrenching yet hopeful. I'm hopeful that millions of people will see this film, that more can become aware of the horrific atrocities that are happening to God's children.The acting was superb. Jim is freaking amazing at what he does. He really made me feel the emotional torment that his character struggled through. I was anticipating a slower moving film but it was fast-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat. It kept me begging to please allow for a satisfactory ending. I wanted to see everyone get what they deserved. Unfortunately, this is real life and not everything has a happy ending. No spoilers at all - the ending is great but left me wanting to know what I can do to help end trafficking. How can I be more aware. What organizations are there to support.Go see this film!~mikeyou-61117 rated 10/10 on 1 June 2023"," Addresses a Difficult Topic in an Powerful Way: I was really impressed with this film. At first thought, I didn't think I wanted to watch a movie about child trafficking. I felt like they would have made it graphic and evil. But this movie didn't do that. Instead of making you feel disgusting inside about the awfulness of child trafficking, it instead made you hopeful that something can be done about it.The overall cinematography, storytelling, and interesting music made this film a perfect set-up for a powerful message. I only took off the one star because I think some of the acting could have been slightly improved, but the film still got it's point across: God's children are not for sale!~calebtshelton rated 9/10 on 24 May 2023"," Don't be afraid to see this.: I was worried there might be things in this movie that would cause trauma. There are no explicit scenes. That being said, this is an important movie and every parent should see it. Not only that, I would recommend it for teens as well. The acting, the script and the whole presentation is first rate. I think about this story, and it is true, and it cuts deep. It also keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Sometimes movies with a message can be either over the top or boring. This was neither. You could hear a pin drop in the theater through most of the film. I hope you will give this movie a chance. You won't regret it and it may open your awareness in a way that could save a child's life (Maybe even your own).~ErinsGloma rated 10/10 on 4 July 2023"
Napoleon (2023) - IMDb,6.6,Joaquin Phoenix|Vanessa Kirby|Tahar Rahim|Rupert Everett|Mark Bonnar|Paul Rhys|Ben Miles|Riana Duce|Ludivine Sagnier|Edouard Philipponnat|Miles Jupp|Scott Handy|Youssef Kerkour|John Hollingworth|Abubakar Salim|Thom Ashley|Jannis Niewöhner|Julian Rhind-Tutt,Ridley Scott,David Scarpa,"An epic that details the checkered rise and fall of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his wife, Josephine."," A few words of warning for those with high expectations...: A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb.~imseeg rated 6/10 on 23 November 2023"," An interesting failure: Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.~petra_ste rated 6/10 on 3 December 2023"," My biggest disappointment this year: Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.~MissSimonetta rated 4/10 on 25 November 2023"," Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep: Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better.~Vic_max rated 6/10 on 22 November 2023"," Knew it was Bad. Even so, Surprised at HOW bad.: I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.~levybob rated 4/10 on 2 December 2023"," Awful.: What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.~krzysiektom rated 2/10 on 26 November 2023"," Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies: Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up.~epicking rated 3/10 on 23 November 2023"," BAD, REALLY BAD, TERRIBLY BAD, AND I WILL EXPLAIN: First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.~LongTimeMovieLover rated 4/10 on 23 November 2023"," Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.: Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.~dhunjiwadia rated 5/10 on 26 November 2023"," Bring on the director's cut!: Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.~zeki-4 rated 7/10 on 22 November 2023"

Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; ""My Favorite Things"" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) ""Maria"", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""So Long, Farewell"", especially little Kym Karath's ""goodbye"" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder ""when will it end?"". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned ""Do Re Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line ""Him?!"", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the ""dueling"" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the ""I Have Confidence"" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!~jacobs-greenwood rated 10/10 on 11 December 2016"," Fantastic family friendly musical classic: The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.~davispittman rated 10/10 on 26 October 2017"," Just a classic that will never get old: Song and dance is definitely not my thing. However I've seen this movie dozens and dozens of times overs the years. It never gets old... if you have never seen it it's well worth your time. They just don't make them like this anymore. Rent it or buy it, a true classic that is perfect from start to finish...~brett-76260 rated 10/10 on 28 April 2018"," Would you even want to solve a problem like Maria? She's wonderful!: Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing ""Few Favorite Things"" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song ""Something Good."" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the ""glories"" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably ""Confidence in Me"", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 10/10 on 23 February 2005"," The Sights & Sounds of The Sound Of Music: *** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,""What Best Picutre winner should I choose for a review?"" Many to choose from of course.The answer came to me when I chose to & replayedthis wonderful film since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the, now grown, child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion.Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid, it usually is the first ""Best Picture"" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life, without even knowing it.When you see it the first time, the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot, you know it's going to be something great.Like many kids, it was only natural I'd like songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""So Long, Farewell"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" (or ""The Yodeling Song"" as some call it) and more. I liked ""Edelweiss"" and ""Climb Every Mountain"" but not until when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and ""Mary Poppins"" and other movies, where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then.Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible, then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive, fair and loving and (of course) singing.Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship.That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert, chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music, as we know, was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories.That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even now .Lastly, because the people behind the scenes, as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves, made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie, well doneSounds like ten stars, for all time. (END)~happipuppi13 rated 10/10 on 6 August 2015"," We are alive with The Sound Of Music: Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: ""It makes you feel alive"" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.~duffjerroldorg rated 10/10 on 12 April 2017"," When you need a pick me up, nothing comes close to this one.: Seven children are lucky enough to receive the glorious Maria as their new nanny.The Sound of Music is definitely one of the greatest musicals of all time. Even the hardest hearted cynics, like myself, who aren't generally fans of musicals, cannot help but be wrapped in the charms of this film.It's almost three hours long, but it's never dull, it never feels long winded or boring. It is genuinely just the most lovely, uplifting, positive movies of all time, even to this day it still manages to captivate. Sometimes you just need something sweet and comforting, this film is like a warm woolen blanket on an icy cold day.Julie Christie actually won the Oscar that year for her role in Darling, and great though she was, I think many would say that Julie Andrews truly deserved the award for this enchanting, memorable performance. Christie's singing is enchanting.Fortunately the film did actually win the oscar for best movie, and rightly so. This film will never ever lose its charm.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 23 June 2023"," How do you solve a problem like Maria?: I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 2 April 2009"," The perfect film musical......: This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as ""Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?"" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, ""If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you."" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (""Seven Brides..."", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""...Molly Brown"", ""The Music Man"", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of ""The Sound of Music"". The film has it all.~Poseidon-3 rated NA on 29 April 2002"," Hollywood's Last Great Musical: ""The Sound of Music"" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 28 October 2000"

Then Priscilla, leaves her life behind to be part of Elvis's life and live it the way he wants her to. The cheating, mistreatment and complete disregard for her feeling eventually pushes her to realize that she has her own identity and it is not worth living somebody else's life. The film documents their life together till their divorce.Having watched Elvis the movie and totally enjoying it to the core, it was hard to buy into this Bad Elvis. Thanks to the performances especially by Cailee Spaeny, I was able to stay with the narrative till the end. This had a serious narrative and it wasn't an easy watch. As it only documents the years from the moment Priscilla meets Elvis and them living together, only to end up in a marriage which parts them enough to give Priscilla enough courage to seek divorce.Once again it was a powerful performance by Cailee and kudos to Sofia Coppola to get such a performance from her and to have that control over the narrative, which successfully portrays the emotional journey of Priscilla. From being a naive teen who is hopelessly in love, despite being ill treated to finally grow up enough to figure out what needs to be done. The pace is slow and like I said, it is not an easy watch.~chand-suhas rated 6/10 on 15 December 2023"," Sofia Coppola's mood piece on Elvis & Priscilla: Early in Sofia Coppola's languid distillation of Priscilla Presley's life with Elvis, she receives a beautifully coiffed and presented gift of a pet poodle. Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) had recently moved into Graceland when she gets the present. 14 when they met in Germany, Priscilla was still only 17. She coddles the pooch and treats it like a little princess. Coppola (who wrote the screenplay adapted from Priscilla's book) makes a case that Elvis (Jacob Elordi) viewed his then future wife as a type of possession. When the teenager asks for permission to take a part-time job, the musician forbades it saying that he needs her to be available whenever he desires. Like the dog, Priscilla is always to be primped and pampered to its owner's specifications.One could say that PRISCILLA represents the other side of Baz Luhrman's recent phantasmagorical film ELVIS in both style and POV. That's certainly true in many ways, but it's doubtful that Coppola would have made her movie much differently even if Luhrman's film didn't exist. Phillipe La Sourd's cinematography, Tamara Deverell's Production Design and Stacey Battat's costuming all fit nicely within Coppola's aesthetic. The filmmaker's love of pop music is also fully on display with period songs mixed freely with more recent tunes in a similar vein (the movie begins with The Ramones and fades out with Dolly Parton).Coppola has rarely been an auteur interested in pure plot and narrative drive. She prefers to soak the viewer into the milieu of her characters. On that level, PRISCILLA has a certain effectiveness. Neither Spaeny nor Elordi are stars, but, their anonymity adds to their relatability. Elordi in particular, faces not only comparisons to Austin Butler's ebullient Oscar nominated performance, but decades of imitators. He humanizes the mythic figure even if, at a certain point, his lack of flash reduces the King of Rock 'N Roll to too much the mere mortal. The elephant in the room is, of course, that Elvis would be considered persona non grata in today's climate. When Priscilla first enters Graceland, Elvis' ever-present entourage are taken aback at how young she looks. Coppola exaggerates the difference by casting actors over a foot apart in height (the real difference was closer to 8""). It does make her look like a little girl (and Spaeny convincingly pulls it off despite being only a year younger than Elordi; Elvis was a decade Priscilla's senior). In Coppola (and Priscilla's) telling, Elvis isn't portrayed as making his young wife into a purely sexual object. He kept her under glass in his misguided notion that he was protecting her. To make her into an idealized good Christian girl and modern Southern belle who his recently deceased mama could have been proud of. It's an extraordinary tricky balance - particularly with the real Priscilla being a Producer on this film.By design, PRISCILLA never takes a truly deep look at all the details of the couple's lives. Colonel Tom Parker is only vaguely alluded to. The viewer sees Elvis performing only near the very end, and briefly. Once at Graceland, Priscilla is barely shown with anyone other than Elvis' posse. The movie only spans the years they were together. It's a very insular movie which relies heavily on mood and atmosphere. It will be up to each individual viewer if that is sufficient.~gortx rated NA on 9 November 2023"," Almost one of Coppola's best; Spaeny is an immediate star: Priscilla is absorbing material told with a quiet confidence; like Marie Antoinette, for at least two thirds of the way in, this feels like it is so close to being one of this director's most Formally and performance-wise impressive and inspired films. Whether you sense any deeper personal connection Coppola may have had with the story (Id need a psychology degree to unpack what it may or may not be like for this director to have been so close to a figure like Francis Coppola, though a much different context), the film largely works as a story where you get not only why a young woman would fall for this man at this time, but why it would be so hard to leave when it gets... rough.When it's Priscilla in her high school years, in total yet totally understandable infatuation with Elvis (that time period when he goes away and she counts the months by calendar, chefs kiss), and even into most of the time into Graceland, it's engrossing. The flaw is when it kept going after running out of things to say; in that sense, ironically given how they are so wholly tonally different films, this has the same problem as Luhrmann's Elvis where it covers so much ground that it runs out of steam dramatically (the Hit The Points We Know sort of thing). If you asked me which is the superior film I'll say Coppola's, but it's not by a long shot exactly, just with different strengths for each.Still, Spaeny gives, along with Dominic Sessa in The Holdovers, the OMG where did *that* come from Young actor turn of the year, as well as Elordi being ideally cast as *this* Elvis, and even with my qualms I would say to anyone vaguely interested to check it out. It's the kind of storytelling where the physical details are so impactful - watch what Priscilla does just before she goes to the hospital to give birth to her daughter, not subtle but a devastating fine-underlined point about her life as it was - and as per Coppola the production design and costuming and the camerawork is fantastic (though it took me a few minutes to adjust to how dark some of the scenes are lit).And I must also add, other mostly splendid music choices besides (sampling from 80s New Wave to Santana), the opening needle drop (""Baby, I Love You,"" by The Ramones via Phil Spector) is as nerve-tingling as the final one is tacky (I'll leave you to be the judge, but I kind of groaned at that forced romantic irony).PS: that moment when Priscilla breaks down and tells Elvis to stop reading from that book is one of my two or three favorite moments from any film this year.~Quinoa1984 rated 8/10 on 5 November 2023"," Expected more: Priscilla takes the spotlight instead of Elvis in this one. It had that retro aesthetic, but it was portrayed differently from the 50s/60s in Baz Luhrmann's 'Elvis.' This film had a more understated, even slightly gloomy vibe in comparison. Andrew just like the visuals, we get a quieter look at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla, told from her perspective.The soundtrack is nice, you don't hear much of Presley's music. Unlike last year's Elvis biopic, this one doesn't cover an entire career; it's solely focused on their marriage. It feels like we spend a significant amount of time watching how they met, but the later years felt like we were skipping stuff. Priscilla seems isolated and controlled by Elvis, whose presence is distant in the movie. The first part of the movie feels like we're sitting through Priscilla's memories, but the last half feels like we're skimming through them.It's hard not to compare them, but Austin Butler's portrayal of Elvis is better than Jacob Elordi's; Butler's performance is almost iconic. Jacob's fine, I just think there was a disconnect between Jacob's speaking voice and his singing voice. The age difference between Elvis and Priscilla is depicted better here, more creepily, mainly due to the innocence Cailee Spaeny conveys, emphasized further by the height difference.There isn't much chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla depicted in this film. Maybe it's how it was in reality and how it's depicted, but it seems like they fell in love over small talk, like ""hey, I miss home,"" ""hey, I like talking to you,"" and then it jumps to the abusive, controlling part of their relationship filled with arguments. Intimacy over small talk.I do think Cailee Spaeny did a great job as Priscilla. You can always tell how she feels, and the movie doesn't need to explicitly state ""oh, she's sad"" for you to understand. We witness the transformation of Priscilla over the years, and Spaeny flawlessly captures the journey from an innocent young fan to a frustrated woman trapped in a controlling and isolating relationship, culminating in her portrayal of a grown woman who had had enough of Elvis' behavior.Honestly, the film isn't particularly special, especially considering the visually epic story we got from the 2021 Elvis movie. I thought it would bring something different or offer deeper insights, especially since it's a well-known story and was recently told on the big screen. But it doesn't feel deeply felt or ravishingly detailed as described.Vegas backdrop looked so fake, like not even cgi, more like when they build small miniature towns and shoot those. Movie's Anticlimactic too.Certain aspects of her life are teased, like her affair with the instructor, which seems essential to the story but is only hinted at. It goes back to how the last years of their marriage are depicted, making it feel like we're skimming through memories instead of experiencing them. Maybe it was just to keep her innocence.It's a story that's already famous, so I expected this film to bring a unique and possibly deeper perspective, but it doesn't offer anything that isn't already known. It feels like it missed the mark and turned out mediocre, uninteresting, and somewhat forgettable for me.~AfricanBro rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," What did these two ever see in each other?: It's a biopic of the relationship between Priscilla Beaulieu and Elvis Presley between 1959 and 1972 in West Germany, Memphis, Tennessee, Las Vegas, and California.In 1959, Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) is the 14-year-old daughter of Ann (Dagmara Dominczyk) and her stepfather, Paul (Ari Cohen), a career military man. The family has recently been posted in West Germany, and Priscilla is lonely. 24-year-old Elvis Presley (Jacob Elordi) is serving his military time in Germany. His friend, Terry West (Luke Humphrey), notices Priscilla in a restaurant and asks if she wants to meet Elvis. Of course, she does, and her parents reluctantly allow them to meet.Elvis appears to fall for Priscilla, and they date for about six months until Elvis's tour of duty is complete, and he returns to the United States to resume his career. Three years later, in 1963, Elvis reconnects with Priscilla and invites her for a visit to Graceland. Her parents reluctantly agree. The film then follows the evolution of their relationship, including the fact that they lived together almost immediately, even as she was finishing grade 12 at a Catholic school. They finally marry in 1967, but the relationship continues downhill almost immediately.There are no good guys in this movie. Priscilla is the victim of a significant power imbalance; her primary role is to encourage the insecure ego of Elvis, who constantly needs to be surrounded by an entourage of fawning sycophants, and who introduces 17-year-old Priscilla to drugs on her first visit to Elvis in 1963. On the other hand, the movie portrays little genuine chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla except for pointless entertainment. They proclaim love for each other, but there never seems to be any depth to the relationship. And the music that shaped Elvis Presley is almost entirely absent.Cailee Spaeny does an excellent job with a mediocre story. Jacob Elordi mumbled enough to miss some of the dialogue. No one else has a personality.~steiner-sam rated 4/10 on 5 November 2023"," Return to Sender: I saw ""Priscilla"" yesterday. ""Priscilla"" is a 2023 American biographical drama film written, directed, and produced by Sofia Coppola, based on the 1985 memoir ""Elvis and Me"" by Priscilla Presley (who served as an executive producer) and Sandra Harmon. It stars Cailee Spaeny in the titular role and Jacob Elordi as Elvis Presley. I looked forward to seeing this film based on the rave reviews it has received. However, I must say that I was disappointed by the film. Some critics say that the movie was ""understated"" - that is an understatement! I found it to be tedious and slow. I just couldn't get invested in Cailee Spaeny's performance - it didn't grab me as authentic. She has limited range as actress - which seems to be all the way from A to B. Jacob Elordi is strikingly handsome (as Elvis was) but he doesn't seem right for the role - he is 6' 5"" and Elvis was 5' 11""! More importantly, his performance is annoying, especially when he mumbles (of course, he could be a victim of Coppola's script and direction). Speaking of writing and direction, Coppola speeds through parts of Priscilla's life towards the end whereas she spends too much in the initial buildup to the marriage. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film. As Elvis sang - ""return to sender"". 4/10.~dlmiley rated 4/10 on 1 December 2023"," Uncomfortable reality coupled with a one-dimensional narrative: Wow, this was an uncomfortable movie to watch. Priscilla invites inevitable comparisons to last year's ""Elvis,"" portraying an exact opposite narrative. Helmed by the talented Sophia Coppola, who commands great respect, and featuring Jacob Elordi, an actor I admire, the film falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, it presents a one-dimensional, flat perspective that left me somewhat disappointed.While the performances are strong, and the direction commendable, Priscilla's narrative feels tedious and slow at times. The harrowing depiction of power imbalances in the central relationship adds a layer of discomfort that makes the film hard to watch. Sophia Coppola's artistic choices unveil a side of the characters that, while impactful, renders the viewing experience challenging. Priscilla sheds light on the vulnerability of a young protagonist, emphasizing the discomfort of witnessing a story where she is just a child.~cutie7 rated 6/10 on 17 December 2023"," Torturous, monotonous and melancholy: Discussing the loss of some brain cells while watching the film ""Priscilla"" is quite an accurate description. I had initially been eager to watch it due to my affinity for period pieces, especially those that depict real historical figures. However, this film proved to be an exercise in complete frustration within the first 15 minutes. It began with an excruciatingly slow pace, followed by a moody atmosphere that failed to captivate in a compelling manner. To make matters worse, it rapidly devolved into an incomprehensible and unpleasant production that relied on numerous quick cuts with reckless abandon.""Priscilla"" made the unfortunate decision to hop between different time periods without delving into any of the characters in a meaningful way. None of them received the development they deserved, including the title character, Priscilla. What was particularly glaring was Sophia Coppola, who directed and wrote the script. Her portrayal of Elvis was nothing short of brutal, depicting him as a mumbling, shy individual with multiple personalities, a serial cheater, bad-tempered, controlling, sexually dysfunctional, stunted in his emotional development, and plagued by a Madonna Complex.No wonder right before she passed away, Lisa Marie Presley hated everything about this script and also thought that it was akin to being a hatchet-job. I'm beginning to have some questions about Priscilla Pressley. She's been involved in too many controversies regarding her daughter, grand-daughter, Elvis and that estate. Just sayin'.First and foremost, it's hard to fathom how a parent could permit a 14-year-old to associate with, and secretly date, a man 10 years older. Even more bewildering is the decision to let her relocate back to the United States, considering her father was stationed in Germany at the time, and reside at his estate. The only explanation that seems plausible is the overpowering influence of money. Given Elvis's wealth and fame, it appears that these factors overshadowed any morality her parents may have had.The film portrays Priscilla as a pampered and privileged young girl, essentially held captive within the opulent confines of Graceland. In one scene, she expresses her desire to secure a job while attending school, telling Elvis it would be fun. However, Elvis dismisses this idea by presenting her with an ultimatum: him or a career, all while he's away filming and allegedly screwing his leading ladies.Do any of us know if all of this is completely true...no, except the fact that her parents did hand her over to Elvis while she was underage. What we also know is that a child shouldn't be living with an adult man like this, and scenes like the one I described, without any context before enduring yet another quick cut time jump, is one of the many things that made this film extremely unbearable.Also, Coppola rushing through years of multiple betrayals, sadness and pleasure at a breakneck pace, made the film feel as if she was trying to check all of the boxes on her ridiculous timeline, rather than fully immersing us in Priscilla's early life and experiences with Elvis.Now let's get to the casting. Jacob Elordi as Elvis didn't strike me as authentic. There wasn't enough suspension of disbelief in the world to buy him as the titular 50s/60s heartthrob. The difference between his Elvis and Austin Butler's Elvis is simple: Elordi played Elvis and Butler became Elvis. That's what made Butler's portrayal more believable and real. Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley was serviceable, though a bit stiff. She had 2 expressions in this film...wide-eyed, young and naive and sullen. That was about it. Even when it cut to her leaving Elvis after his Vegas show, there was nothing for the audience to get excited about. And by no means are either of these performances award-worthy, no matter what the Hollywood PR machine is spinning.In case you might be thinking about Col. Tom Parker, he never appeared in this film. You just heard Elvis on the phone with him. Even Priscilla's parents were in it sporadically. Elvis' mother was already dead and his father popped in and out with his now wife or girlfriend, that too wasn't fully explained. His grandmother, Black housekeeper and his so-called ""memphis mafia"" were seen here and there.""Priscilla"" is a torturous, monotonous and melancholy story surrounding the relationship between Priscilla and Elvis....nothing more than that. It had the potential to be a seering and engrossing film because all of the elements were there, but the ball was badly dropped and much to this film's detriment, no one took the time to find it.I usually like Sophia Coppola's films, with the exception of that abysmal ""The Beguiled"", and I'm sure I'll end up in the minority with my take about this film, but none of it worked for me. From the beginning to the end, I kept wondering what in the Hell am I watching???~syd9907 rated 1/10 on 8 November 2023"," Bland and boring: How can they make such an interesting story into such an uniteresting movie? Well, that's a good question.Some of the reasons as follows.No chemistry. No emotions. No sensuality or sex. Nothing interesting happens. No new insights. No real suspense, tension, happiness, joy or emotions. Just actors trying to act without any real feeling getting through to the viewer.And the actor that plays Elvis are to tall for the role. He doesn't come through as someone that millions of girls and guys would love. And what about the music? Just a collection of songs that have no relation to Elvis.Nope, this is just a bland and boring try to tell the Priscilla - Elvis story, without actually telling us more than a short written article could do as good, or bad.~petercarlsson-92297 rated 1/10 on 16 December 2023"," keep the home fires burning: Greetings again from the darkness. It was less than 18 months ago when Baz Luhrman's Oscar nominated ELVIS hit theaters and we were admiring Austin Butler's performance. Where that movie was glitzy and loud and centered on Elvis and Col Tom Parker, this current film from writer-director Sofia Coppola (Oscar winner for LOST IN TRANSLATION, 2003) offers a quieter, more intimate glimpse at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla through her eyes.Ms. Coppola is a detailed filmmaker who excels when dealing with personal isolation, and Priscilla makes a fitting and worthy subject. The screenplay by Coppola and Sandra Harmon is adapted from Priscilla Presley's 1985 memoir, ""Elvis and Me"", a book that also served as the basis for the 1988 TV movie of the same name (screenplay by Ms. Harmon). Although Elvis Presley Enterprises was not involved with this film (explaining the lack of familiar Elvis music), Priscilla Presley did serve as Executive Producer (EP, ironically), so her memories and preferences likely play a key role in much of what we see here.Relative newcomer Cailee Spaeny (""Mare of Easttown"") delivers an outstanding performance - from 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu in 1959 to Elvis's bride in 1967 through their divorce in 1973. Ms. Spaeny perfectly captures the wide-eyed innocence of a young fan, the frustrations of a young woman being controlled and isolated, and finally, a grown woman standing up for her own freedom. Playing Elvis through this same time period is Jacob Elordi (""Euphoria""), and he is effective in mimicking the familiar mannerisms and speaking voice. Physically, he towers over the diminutive Spaeny, which although not historically accurate, does add a dimension to the couple's disconnect. As for the age difference, the two actors are close in age, but are able to portray the actual 10 year age gap between Elvis and Priscilla.The creep factor is ever-present as 24-year-old Elvis, overseas on military duty, shows an elevated interest in 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, whose military father is also stationed in Germany. The naivety of their first meetings is captured as Elvis' beloved mother has recently passed away. Both are lonely and away from home, and Elvis simply finds her easy to talk to. It's hindsight to question how parents could allow the situation to escalate, but anyone who has parented a teenager understands the challenges. When Priscilla turns 17, she moves into Graceland, yet Elvis insists the intimacy wait until after they are married.At the core of the story is Priscilla's solitude and loneliness. She is confined to Graceland and requested to ""keep the home fires burning"" as Elvis marches off to the stream of movies set up by a never-seen-here Col Tom Parker. Keeping Parker on the phone allows Priscilla's world to remain even smaller despite being married to the biggest star on the planet. Doses of Elvis and the Memphis Mafia occur between extended stretches alone with Elvis' grandmother and personal cook. She is isolated from the real world and clearly controlled by Elvis, who was only partially present.When Priscilla and Elvis are together, the strain is apparent. Prescription drugs and sexual tension are interrupted by periodic bursts of Elvis anger, followed by a sincere apology. It's here where we realize he's more of a kid than she is ... emotionally stunted in what makes a relationship (it takes more than the tabloid reports of movie set flings Priscilla reads about). This is also evident as she watches him go through many phases in search of himself - martial arts, bible study, eastern philosophy, etc. In the family photo shoot with Lisa Marie, body language tells the whole story. Priscilla's fling with karate instructor Mike Stone is teased, but not dwelled upon. We realize that Priscilla was the one thing in life he felt he could control. By the end, one of them has escaped the cage, while the other remains captive.Voted 'Best Film' at this year's Venice Film Festival, it also reminds us what a terrific filmmaker Sofia Coppola can be. Working with a limited budget, she and her team are so proficient, it never seems as if they cut corners. Cinematographer Philipe Le Sourd and Editor Sarah Flack manage to sustain the pacing despite an inordinate amount of time Priscilla spends on her own at Graceland. Production Designer Tamara Deverell recreated the recognizable interior of Graceland, while the work of Costume Designer Stacey Battat guides us through the fashion changes that occurred over these 14 years. The film recreates some of the iconic images and moments that are ingrained in our memory banks, and director Coppola chooses to end with Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"", supposedly the song Elvis sang to Priscilla as they finalized the divorce.Opens in theaters on November 3, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 2 November 2023"

Great work.... everyone.~LordCommandar rated 8/10 on 28 December 2023"," Very Good Movie: Rating: 8.7Overall, a very polished period drama that is executed well on many fronts as the direction, cinematography, and performances from Mads Mikkelsen and Amanda Collin help create a very captivating movie, but the writing and story construction hold it back from being something great.Very Good Direction (Does a great job on a macro-scale as some of the scenes look stunning as he effectively uses cinematography and editing to capture their grand nature (like in the palaces and especially in the farming scenes; does a very good job on a micro-scale as he develops sequences very well; gets a lot out of his actors as they all work well with Mikkelson to drive the story forward; the biggest drawback is the storytelling as it is kinda predictable with what is going to happy next (especially with the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist as its pretty generic and cliche with how its told), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Mads Mikkelsen (Has somewhat of a grit to this performance that helps show who his character is; he controls every scene he is in and really lifts the performances around him as he acts as someone to work off of; shows his experience and why he is one of the most renowned Danish actors in cinema history), Very Good from Amanda Collin (Very Good female lead to Mikkelsen as the two have great chemistry, but she also has moments where she shines on her own (especially in the climax); really embodies someone who is of the working class and looking for revenge), Good from Simon Bennebjerg (Plays the pompous prick role well as he does his best effort to make sure everyone hates him (though this makes his performance a bit one-sided as he is written pretty shallowly), Good from the rest of the cast (does their job helping move the story forward and working with Mikkelsen to make the scenes more interesting)), Pretty Good to Good Story (The concept uses a baseline source material that is very interesting and draws your attention because its based on a true story; The story construction is kinda an issue because the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist is pretty shallow since it just follows many cliches about the power trip of royalty, and this affects the plot as it has to construct itself around this major conflict (although the overarching storyline between the protagonist and the king and the protagonist developing relationships with the female lead and child are written well); the flow of sequences is fine and does a good job in making the story interesting; the character writing for the protagonist, the female lead, and child are good as their grit present them as more well-rounded characters trying to achieve something, but the writing for the other characters (especially the antagonist) is very shallow that you do not really care for them towards the end of the movie), Good Screenplay (The dialogue is well written and comes off very polished (staying true to 1700s vernacular); the humor is used decently well to lift the tension in some of the traumatic scenes (especially with the antagonist to show how twisted he is); the use of symbolism is decently present, but the message just feels like it isn't clearly conveyed with the direction they chose in the end; the foreshadowing is pretty good)), Very Good Score (Felt really similar to Joker and used well to set the tone), Great Cinematography (Really polished and helps show the vastness of the world and the emotions of the characters), Very Good Sound (Felt very crisp and helped with building tension), Very Good Editing (Used well in conjunction with the Cinematography to deliver a polished product), Very Good Visual Effects (The use of practical effects makes the move stunning (especially the use of fire and blood)), Great Production Design (Helps with setting the time period as they build these grand palace sets as a dichotomy to the rural landscapes to show the separation of the classes), Very Good Costumes (Helps with setting the time period and showing the juxtaposition between the upper and lower classes), Plot Structure was fine for the most part as all the overarching plot elements were there and built on each other in a standard fashion; the main issue is the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is just a bit too cliche and forced that it has a major impact on how the rising action develops (but it does help with the climax though); the exposition just drags a lot and is very unnecessary/forced (could have been removed and the movie would have been the same), Pacing was a bit on the slower side as it followed the pace of other period dramas (but it does move faster than most movies in its genre), Climax was very good itself and executed well (especially with Collin's performance); the exposition just really dampers this climax as it ruins the momentum built up by a well-executed sequence, Tone was very similar to other period dramas (does not provide anything new on this front), Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest.~cinemapersonified rated 8/10 on 5 November 2023"," Brilliant, Moving, Emotional: I watched this movie at the Busan International Film Festival this week. I went into it, without much information and didn't know what to expect. And oh wow, it blew me away. I straight away put it on my ""Top 10 Favourite Movies of all Time"" list.First of all Mads Mikkelsen is a phenomenal actor and the perfect choice to play Ludvig Kahlen. He shines especially in the scenes, where he ""only"" acts out pure emotion with his facial expressions without having to say a word. There is one scene at the very end, where he sits all alone in his farm house, eating at a table and the camera zooms into a close up shot onto his face. It is a captivating scene, were no words are spoken but so much was said. He is a superb actor.Throughout the movie you feel all kinds of emotions yourself: anger, hatred, sadness, frustration, disgust, joy, relief,.. I felt it all. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions.I felt strong hatred for the villain of the story played by Simon Bennebjerg, who was also a perfect cast for this. You really start to hate his character pretty early on, his arrogance, greed and disrespect for all people around him, make him a despicable character.After watching the movie, my friend and I had a long discussion about human greed and what our motivation in life is. Is it worth to betray, let down and/or loose loved ones over a title, money and/or fame?10 out of 10, worth every second.~katcarajenncy rated 10/10 on 11 October 2023"," A beautiful and well balanced story with great acting: This was a surprisingly good movie. I've been disappointed by quite a few period drama pieces from the last years, so my expectations going in were not very high, especially given the description of it being ""Western set in 18th century Denmark"". But going out of the theatre I had to admit that I had a near perfect cinema experience. The movie was beautifully filmed with nearly each frame being a work of art. The acting was superb and the characters were interesting and well-developed. Mads Mikkelsen was stellar in his role, and I loved Ann Barbara, Anmai Mus and the priest. Simon Bennebjerg was great as the unhinged, but charismatic Frederik de Schinkel. The plot wasn't particularly original, but it kept you invested in the story, and was logical and well-rounded and the ending left no loose threads. The love story was compelling without being overly dramatic - because most love stories aren't! Another reviewer commented that it felt unnatural to him but to me on contrary it felt very realistic that these characters would seek out each other's warmth and comfort in the circumstances they were placed in. Other parts were well-balanced too - it had just enough blood and fighting and torture scenes to get the story across, but none just for drama's sake. The movie borrowed a lot of elements from the Western genre, but it felt authentic and in no way like a Hollywood clone. All in all, it was fantastic, well rounded film and a great cinematic experience.~formenteralady rated 10/10 on 20 October 2023"," Everything I hoped for and more!: I've been waiting on this film since it was under preproduction and it was worth the wait. The acting from everyone was fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen went deep into his character and it really showcased his acting skills. He was amazing.It was witty, brutal, beautiful, funny (I give credit to Anders Thomas Jensen for that) and nail biting. It had a great flow to it.Nicolaj Arcel filmed this one and he also did ""A Royal Affair"", but I really can't compare the two of them. Two completely different stories. ""A Royal Affair"" had more of romance story attached to it, but this goes a bit deeper and darker.Please do yourselves a favor and see this in the theater if you get a chance.

I'm no movie critic, just a guy that loves to watch a good flick, but Mads always delivers intense performance, no matter be it a comedy or drama. Every character in this movie, as soon as they are introduced on the screen, shows layers and layers of their persona and its just incredible how they do it. Acting, by all of the actors, was absolutely superb! Within first few sentences of a character, you feel like you know their past, what drives them, why are they the way they are etc...just incredible. The whole movie is heavy with emotion you can cut with a knife, and I felt sucked into the story from minute 1. Thats what we need in a movie, engrossing entertainment, great acting and great stories, not agenda pushing. No sub-story here, just good 'ol acting and entertainment.~tohmsono rated 10/10 on 29 December 2023"," yet another...: Excellent scandinavian historical drama, moulded in the good hands of danish filmakers this time, on the moors and marshland of jutlandia, said to be barren and harsh dirt where no plants of edible kind would grow.Mads mikkelsen , is the captain of this vessel called ''b......n'' in danish and ''promised land'' in english, not to well translated as a b.....d is a b.....d both in danish and english language, and the word should be allowed used in the reviews on IMDB as long as the danish title says so....Its a story taking place in the 1700's, about the pioneers of danish agricultural development, using the newly introduced potatoe to the danish society. Its the battle between the layman and the lords, the peasants and the landowners, and a mighty king on top of the pyramide, that encourage development...a very well handcrafted film, that reach far beyond todays national borderlines, an icecold glance that will grip yor mind and heart for its lavishness and upper class injustice to maintain their grip on society. Its costumes and style of the era has been very well taken care of, also the etched through hate towards the travellers and other ''outcasts'' of society in this era.Its a long playtime, but i cant see where to cut it down at length, therefore bare over with that, and turn your zeitgeist back to the 1750's, its a recommend from the grumpy old man.~ops-52535 rated 9/10 on 25 December 2023"," Mads Mikkelsen is rarely in bad movies: ""The Promised Land"" (Bastarden in Danish), based on a book by Ida Jessen called ""The Captain and Ann Barbara"" which in turn, based on a real life person is about a captain (Mads Mikkelsen) who sets out to conquer the Heath in Jutland which is said to be impossible to grow anything in. Throughout, he meets a lot of resistance working towards his goal.I like Mads Mikkelsen as an actor, let me just get that straight out of the way. This guy rarely RARELY makes bad movies. He's just too good and underrated. The movie itself was pretty good too. I found myself pretty invested in the plot and the different characters. Mads Mikkelsen was brilliant in the role of Ludvig Kahlen and Amanda Collin was amazing as Ann Barbara the housekeeper. And not to talk about how good Simon Bennebjerg was as the villain, Frederik de Schinkel (also based on a real person). The film was emotional at times too.Here's my only strife with the movie and literally my only strife... Although both Mads Mikkelsen and Frederik de Schinkel existed back in the 1700's which the movie took place, in real life they had absolutely nothing to do with each other. At least from the little i've read online. I found it weird they decided to mix them together in this.~darapjohnson rated 7/10 on 28 December 2023"," Good Period Drama from Nikolaj Arcel: Danish cinema has made some impressive films in the past and while, The Promised Land is no where my favorite Danish movie, it certainly is one of the most gorgeous looking one I have seen in awhile.Filmmaker Nikolaj Arcel created A Royal Affair which I thought was pretty good. Unfortunately his work a The Dark Tower was pretty awful but luckily, this new movie is big improvement as it showcases Arcel's talents on the direction, narrative and the characters. Throughout, the camerawork is gorgeous and many of the costumes, sound designs and the effects are well-done as it helped captured the time era and the setting. Many of the themes of fight aganist greed, cruelty, land ownership, landscapes, people, and other themes on the western genre are well explored. All of the performances are pretty great as Mads Mikkelsen and Amanda Collin provided the best performance throughout.The narrative is pretty interesting, although a few writing concepts that felt a bit predictable. I personally enjoyed the characters but I felt some of the other characters could have been explored a little more on certain levels of development. The soundtrack is great, the dialogue is well-written and the pacing, while a few slow moments, is pretty good as I didn't feel bored throughout observing the movie.Overall, It's a good film from Denmark and it's great to see Arcel getting a new chance with a better film.~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"

Byrne|Kenneth Choi|Brian Sacca|Henry Zebrowski,Martin Scorsese,Terence Winter|Jordan Belfort,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government."," It really is a comedy: There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"", that has to be seen to be believed ...~kosmasp rated 9/10 on 18 June 2014"," SELL ME THIS PEN: Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks, i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money, he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.I thought that Jonah Hill gave one of his best performances. The production is awfully long, not wanting to miss out on any details. The film goes into detail to explain to the audience things like IPO and the history and effects of quaaludes. If you note the ludes he took early in the film were crumbly. Those were non-prescription ludes made from a pill press in uncle Vinnie's garage and not too potent. Later they score some real ludes. Having taken the fake ones for so long, they didn't know how to handle them causing them to crash, like the money it was too much too fast.The main criticism of the film is that it featured over 500 F-bombs. It really didn't seem like that many due to the length of the production. Besides you get numb to it after the first few hundred or so.~nogodnomasters rated 9/10 on 4 October 2018"," High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor: This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.~bob the moo rated NA on 17 January 2014"," Oscar worthy: The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress.

The movie never gets boring, I could watch this anytime.~karolin-99263 rated 10/10 on 29 December 2020"," Awesome movie, watched it multiple times: This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio, Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away.~MrHeraclius rated NA on 23 February 2020"," Decadent, shocking, brilliant.: Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Martin Scorsese isn't just a film maker, he's a genius, he's The Master of film, and this is another of his jewels. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my all time favourites.The remarkable story of Jordan Belfort, is love to know how much of this is actually true. There are multiple shocking scenes, my jaw dropped multiple times, one thing is clear, money talks.It's shocking, but it's also hilarious, there are so many funny moments, that scene with the dog at the end of the bed, too funny.Production values are off the charts, this film truly looks tremendous, it feels as though no one frame is wasted, no opportunity is missed to show off the wealth, the orgy of sex, drugs and money.Another stellar performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, he is outstanding as Belfort, one of his very best, not only does he look the part, but he exudes the character's greed's and desires.Robbie and Hill are first rate. It gets an extra point for featuring Joanna Lumley, albeit in a small role.A fascinating story.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 29 November 2023"," ""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive."": It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.~notoriousCASK rated 9/10 on 24 October 2018"," DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.: In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com~BrentHankins rated 9/10 on 24 December 2013"," My favorite movie of the 2010's: What can I say.

They are usually set in the 'grim' north and are about underdogs winning against the odds. But while 'Bank of Dave' does fit that synopsis, it manages to be fresh, funny, and relevant. It doesn't dwell on grime for grittiness - it actually shows how beautiful the north of England is, how friendly the people are, and it's a joy to watch the central character of a London lawyer fall for the northern charm. But that's just a side show to the main story which is an incredible true story I wasn't previously aware of, and one that needs to be told. My Netflix subscription is currently balancing on a knife's edge, but this film managed to save it from being cancelled this month.

There are a couple of laugh out load moments a background romance.I thought Joel Fry played his part magnificently as the slightly confused southerner thrown into the north of England.The story of Dave Fishwick is described at the beginning as True(ish) as there is clearly a lot of artistic licensing going off.

That seems a bit of a stretch of the imagination but I won't try and find out if it did actually happen.It was also nice to see a film that is clearly not a pilot for a potential series.And of course it does make a very important point about the banking sector.

One of whom, is called Dave.: Who doesn't love a good British dramatic comedy. This isn't one of those. This is a bloody great British dramatic comedy. Based on true events too. We're up north. In Burnley to be precise. With Dave (Rory Kinnear). Dave's a good sort. Local lad. Everyone knows Dave. Everyone trusts Dave. Dave has a profitable business. Dave has money. Dave helps people out. He lends them money. They pay him back. He's already doing what he's destined for. Going pro though. That's what this film is about. A bloke opening his own bank. Sounds far fetched doesn't it. It's not. It's not easy though. The system is geared against the small guy. Clarence (Angus Wright) is part of the system. He's a lawyer, so is his underling Hugh (Joel Fry). They're the established. The London toffs looking down on people like Dave. They'll take his money though, offer their services to try get him set up, even though they don't give him a hope in hell. Without a new bank established in England in over 150 years, the odds are against Dave. That's what makes this such a great story. We love the underdog don't we. Rory is sent to Burnley. Dave sees through Rory. He knows what he's up against. Rory thinks he's nuts. Dave is not nuts. Let's be clear not only is this a great story. This is a great cast. Kinnear and Fry are excellent. Aren't they always, but together well it's just wonderful. What Dave's proposing isn't just loaning money. His vision is changing lives. Creating jobs, finding dreams, saving lives. ""This is all really impressive"" says Hugh after Dave's toured him round the town showing off his portfolio, but he's got a but. Dave stops him in his tracks as simply asks ""The question I want you to answer isn't can The Bank of Dave exist, but should The Bank of Dave exist"". He's got Hugh there. He's got me. I'd run through brick walls for Dave. Okay it's a little obvious where this is headed, but bloody hell the ride is fun. The north south divide, the elite against the people. It's fertile ground. Clarence is used sparingly but his slightly caricatured presence is joyous, ""Toodle pip!"". Hugh Bonneville turns up too. He's Sir Charles, part of the establishment too and his meeting with Hugh shows us the first sign that Hugh isn't only on board with Dave's plan, he's up for a rumble. Things are going to get messy. Obvious where this was headed? Well maybe, but it's not a straight road. For starters I wasn't expecting The Goa Express to show up, never mind Def Leppard, an unrecognisable Paul Kaye or Sean Dyche! This is a feel good film and it's an absolute corker. Honestly that's an understatement. You might already know what happens from real life events, but I'm not going to spoil it. Whether you do or not this is a truly wonderful film, about a wonderful story, with incredibly wonderful people.

His affable character an audience will warm to immediately I hope the real Dave Fishwick is as likeable .Dave has had great success with his mini van business sharing his success with his community when they've asked for it in increasing difficult financial times.The huge London Banks haven't helped the citizens of Burnley at all charging high interest rates and rejecting most loan applicants who just can't afford the massive repayments.So Dave puts in an application to open a Community Bank to assist his business clients and friends with the intention of reinvesting their deposits in charity and local worthy causes like a badly needed free hospital clinic.This is where he meets Goliath the British Banker Association run by the so called super rich ""right sorts of men "" . They decide to keep the status quo that they must try and block Dave's application in case it starts a trend to undermine their exclusive rules regarding their Banking system.Dave's is the first application for a Community based Bank in 120 years and he commissions the help of Hugh a young London solicitor who travels up to Burnley to interview Dave and prepare his application .Hugh warns him that the odds are stacked against him but is gradually won over with Dave's sensible explanation as to why his Community needs a bank as well as his honest motives so he decides to take on what seems an impossible task.That's enough plot line the ensemble characters in Bank of Dave take over and form the best part of the story from this point.There's a brewing romance of course and plenty of fun especially in The Duck and Drake Inn where the locals drink and Karaoke Dave takes to the floor.Two standout performances for me apart from Rory Kinnear are Joel Fry as Hugh the London solicitor who is reluctant at first to travel to Burnley but soon is won over by the spirit of the locals and Phobe Dynevor as Dave's lovely niece Alexandra who is an overworked Doctor in Burnley hospital her friendship with Hugh thaws out after a rocky start.I love it when the Brits do what they do best aside from pomp and circumstance when their movies highlight real everyday characters involved in David and Goliath battles that movie audiences relate to with their own daily struggles .In this category I think of movies like Pride, 2014 Brassed Off 1996 , Made in Dagenham (2010) and two delightful movies also written by Piers Ashworth thewriter of Bank of Dave Fisherman's Friends (2019) and Save the Cinema (2022).This is one reason for me why Bank of Dave is an excellent example of an entertaining movie in every aspect because it's intelligent,believable and doesn't patronise its audiences with unnecessary sentiment and padding.I resonated with Bank of Dave because our community outside the City is fortunate to have a Bank that does contribute back to local projects we support it and they support us often displaying a huge copy of a charitable cheque to a good local cause in its shopfront.There's great music as I mentioned in Bank of Dave and a cameo performance from what I've read is a legendary British rock band Def Leppard who just happen to be touring in concert in Sydney this coming November.My 10/10 rating in this case isn't for epic spectacle or necessarily Oscar worthy performances it's for pure entertainment ,wonderful characters great script and a cinema experience that uplifted me .Bank of Dave is a complete departure from the angst that seems to be so prominent in our movie world and real world today .Community and Connection are still the most important virtues .~tm-sheehan rated 10/10 on 5 June 2023"," Brilliant British movie: I love British movies and even more so when they are based on a true story.

This is a great story, it might be a feel good story but it's true. It's very topical showing the banking elite and their failures and how they appeared to the everyday man.

In a way mirroring the sentiments of classics like It's a Wonderful Life, this film shows what can be achieved when people come together to take on the powers that be. An uplifting gem.~clivejenner-35565 rated 8/10 on 18 January 2023"," Bank of Dave: Bank of Dave is a heavily fictionalised feelgood comedy drama about Dave Fishwick (Rory Kinnear.) A truck and minibus dealer in Burnley. After the financial crash of 2008 when banks got bailed out but stopped lending to those in need.Fishwick wanted to start a not for profit bank that would give loans to the local community.In his way is the elitist banking establishment determined that northerner like Fishwick will not get his bank off the ground. So he gets the help of a corporate lawyer Hugh (Joel Fry) from London to make the application for a banking licence.Bank of Dave rightly takes a stick to the banking fat cats who took fraudulent risks, went bust, saved by a Labour government and the taxpayer. All so they could carry on regardless.The movie is too formulaic. Northerners are the salt of the earth, Londoners are hissable villains. There is a romantic subplot involving Hugh and a NHS doctor.There is a good performance from Rory Kinnear. Despite his father hailing from Wigan, his accent seemed to be more generic northern than Lancashire.Director Chris Foggin knows which buttons to push to give it a warm glow. The songs help as well as an appearance from Def Leppard.~Prismark10 rated 6/10 on 25 January 2023"," Feel-good British at it's best: Everything you'd expect from a UK based film, pulled heartstrings, decent soundtrack, good character acting and a nice story, well told.Joel Fry is excellent and stakes a claim for the next slightly nervy, slightly cute, slightly awkward leading man that all UK based comedies/love stories need. Rory Kinnear rapidly becoming a mainstay too, justifiably so despite the questionable accent that tended to wander around the Northern Shires throughout the film but this didn't take anything away from the decency of his character.Lots of top names appear throughout the film, that'll have you pausing it and trying to remember what you last saw them in.I enjoyed the film a lot, and it's message is worth remembering; that good people DO exist, but you don't always notice them.~johntstrick rated 9/10 on 18 January 2023"

The Life of Sir Nicholas Winton"" by Barbara Winton. Directed by James Hawes and starring Anthony Hopkins in the lead role, it is a simple human interest story that carries itself as humbly as its lead subject.In 1938, British stockbroker Nicholas ""Nicky"" Winton (Anthony Hopkins) visits Czechoslovakia to assist with matters regarding the Jewish population. While there, Nicky works hard to rescue large numbers of children to be transported back to England before the Nazis can have them sent to concentration camps. Throughout the rest of his life, Nicky is encouraged by his family to make his deeds known to the public, but he instead chooses to keep them to himself. In 1988, Nicky's wife discovers a scrapbook in their attic detailing all of the children and their families he helped save, and subsequently sends it to the media. As a result of this, Nicky's heroism receives wider acknowledgment, but is he prepared for all the attention he could garner from this?Thanks to the efforts of one man in particular, there are over 6,000 people in the world who are alive today because of his actions. That man in question is Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker who risked his life to rescue 669 children from becoming victims of the Holocaust, earning him the nickname ""The British Schindler"". However, it wasn't until half a century later that Nicholas's humanitarian work was made known to the public, when the media caught wind of his good deeds and reached out to the children and the relatives of those he saved. In the 2023 film ""One Life"", we are presented with a straightforward, respectful look at Nicholas's life in a way I am sure he would most likely approve.The film is presented to us in a fairly conventional manner, which is fine as this can be seen as a reflection of Nicholas himself, who was a relatively humble man. When we are first introduced to Nicholas, he is an elderly man in the late 1980s sifting through papers he chooses to keep hidden away from his family. Immediately afterwards, the film flashes back to 1938 where we see a twenty-something Nicholas arriving in Czechoslovakia to undertake work among the local Jewish community. It is here that Nicholas meets some of the Jewish children, with whom he forms a friendly, albeit brief bond with when he shares his chocolate bar with a select few. From here, Nicholas becomes inspired to focus his efforts on helping these children, even if it comes at the risk of attracting attention from the advancing Nazi threat.James Hawes's direction is effective at conveying Nicholas's emotional state whenever the film needs to showcase it. For instance, in one scene where we see Nicholas browsing through his scrapbook, all of the photographs and descriptions of the children are seen reflected in his glasses. The camera then zooms in on his face to show how much emotion he is filled with as he recollects all of the youths he saved and, rather tragically, the ones he could not. We see how conflicted Nicholas is in his reminiscing, as while it is true he managed to rescue so many children, he cannot escape the guilt of the ones who were far less fortunate. I was pleased to see that the film tackled this angle to Nicholas as a person as it would have been easy to only examine the positive aspects of his deeds while completely disregarding the negative. The fact of the matter is that Nicholas has always had to deal with this emotional burden, and making it public knowledge may not be what he needs to overcome his feelings of self-doubt.As the lead character, Anthony Hopkins once again proves that he's one of the best actors currently working today as he perfectly depicts the elderly Nicholas throughout all of his emotional states. Most of the time, it isn't through Hopkins's line delivery or his reaction to things, but through his body language that helps his performance leave the most impression. Aside from the aforementioned scene with the scrapbook, I also really liked this one part where Nicholas is sitting quietly in a chair by his pool overcome with the emotion of reminiscing about what he did fifty years earlier. Here, he simply sits there staring off into the distance fighting back tears until his wife arrives to comfort him. In the hands of a lesser actor, this scene may have been forgettable but Hopkins shows his ability to act using his body rather than simply through words during this scene, which gives a moment like this considerably more impact than it should.However, this is clearly a one man show, and while that does make sense in the long run, it seems like kind of a waste to include all these other notable actors and do very little with them. Helena Bonham Carter plays the young Nicholas's mother, who essentially taught him the selfless value of doing good deeds for the sake of others. Unfortunately, she is only in the film for about five minutes and these are exclusively during the flashback scenes. Similarly, Jonathan Pryce appears as the older version of one of the people whom Nicholas worked with to rescue the children. His screen time is even less than Carter's and didn't really add anything particularly important to the film. Regardless, I still appreciate that all of these actors each wanted to be part of a film that helps preserve the legacy of someone important like Nicholas Winton.Although the film can hardly be considered groundbreaking from a creative viewpoint, ""One Life"" still has moments of poignancy that are well worth your time. The subject matter alone warrants at least one viewing, as it is rare to hear about such great deeds being enacted by an uncommonly humble individual. In a world full of fake charitable people who only do nice deeds to stroke their egos, it's refreshing to know that there are people out there like Nicholas Winton who choose to do the right thing out of the kindness of their hearts. The world definitely needs more people like that, and if you can't find someone like that, be someone like that.I rate it 8/10.~MrDHWong rated 8/10 on 24 December 2023"," The World Needs More Stories Like This: Turn on the news and what do you see? Man's inhumanity to man. Ukraine, Gaza etc etc. It's enough to make you lose faith in the human race - or it would be were it not for the occasional story of humanity at its best.In Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, a small group of people (Nicholas Winton is the best known as he was the last survivor of that group) are appalled by the plight of mainly Jewish refugees, and resolve to do something. Despite opposition from governments (German, Dutch, British and American) they manage to evacuate 669 children and provide them with foster families in the UK, where many of their descendants live to this day. A further 200+ children were on a train that was scheduled to leave on the day war was declared. Fewer than a dozen of them were still alive in 1945.Then the story was forgotten for more than forty years, until at last Nicholas Winton was given the recognition he deserved (not the least astonishing part of the story is that Robert Maxwell did one decent thing in his life).The film is in two parts; the younger Winton being played by Johnny Flynn, the older by Anthony Hopkins. Both give stand-out performances. Also excellent is Helena Bonham Carter as Winton's mother. The scene where she tells a bureaucrat what she thinks of him is priceless.But the most important aspect of the film is its message. Human kindness is still a force in the world. Everyone can make a difference. No good deed, be it great or small, is ever wasted.If only governments were run by people like Nicholas Winton.~Lomax343 rated 8/10 on 29 December 2023"," Uncovering a hidden hero: Set against the backdrop of the rising Nazi threat in 1938, ""One Life"" tells the true story of Nicholas Winton, a young British stockbroker who embarks on a daring mission. Driven by a sense of humanity, Winton orchestrates the Kindertransport, rescuing hundreds of Jewish children from Czechoslovakia and bringing them to safety in Britain. The film weaves through time, showcasing the immediate impact of Winton's actions on the rescued children as well as the decades of silence that followed as Winton kept his heroic deeds under wraps. (Bard AI)One Life is an amazing story that I certainly had never heard about before. It's disappointing that it is told in such a conventional style. The story of Nicholas Winton follows a somewhat predictable trajectory, with occasional tropes we have seen in many wartime dramas. Despite this, Anthony Hopkins, who plays the older Nicholas Winton, and Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Babette Winton, both put in moving, nuanced performances that bring Winton's story alive.As we know from other wartime stories, the power of individual action in the face of incredible adversity is staggering. The fear and desperation of the child refugees is effectively portrayed, along with heartwarming moments of hope and resilience. In a story like this, the moral ambiguities, the deep resources of courage, and the profound weight of responsibility gave me plenty to think about even after the credits rolled.There were several things that detracted from the quality of the film. Pacing was a bit of a problem. Some parts of the story felt rushed, and other parts could have done with some tighter editing. The cinematography, while providing an evocative backdrop for the story, never really had the emotional weight needed for this sort of story. Some scenes bordered on being excessively sentimental, which, at times, diminished the authenticity of the movie. Some supporting characters could have done with some deeper development and backstories, and there needed to be a more balanced presentation of the story's two timelines so we could better understand the young and older versions of Winton.While One Life isn't groundbreaking, it is well made and is a valuable reminder and tribute to an extraordinary man of courage. The strengths outweigh the flaws, making it worthwhile to watch for all ages (except very young children because of the mature themes). And Winton's story makes us question whether heroism is more about big deeds or small acts of bravery. One day, each of us may be called on to be heroic, and One Life provides us with an opportunity to think about how we might choose to act in those situations. Will we have the courage to help out in the small ways that can make a big difference?~steveinadelaide rated 7/10 on 17 December 2023"," Great film about saving children from Nazis: This film runs on two parallel tracks. In 1938-39, young British stockbroker Nicholas Winton volunteers to spend one week in Prague helping the refugee organization there organize their files. He found children who had fled Germany or German-occupied Sudetenland, and decided that he needed to get them out to Britain. That involved finding foster parents, getting visas from initially reluctant bureaucrats, and raising money, not just for the trip, but a deposit for returning the children ""when it was safe to do so"". It ended when Britain declared war on Germany, and a British visa became worthless as protection against German authorities.The other track is in 1987, when Nicky hands over his Prague scrapbook to a researcher. It included the photographs, names, and last known addresses of the children. The information went to a normally-fluffy British TV show, where Nicky was introduced to one of his ""children"" the show had found. That led to a follow-up show after many other ""Nicky's children"" contacted the TV show.This story has been the subject of at least one documentary, but not yet brought to life as a drama. The cinematography was interesting, in that the color palette could immediately inform the viewer of the time period of the story. The 1987 scenes have the bigger stars, but the 1939 scenes form the bulk of the film, and are far more gripping.I saw this at the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Due the the actors' strike, the actors were not present, but they managed to assemble maybe a dozen of Nicky's children to see their own story on the screen.~chong_an rated 9/10 on 17 September 2023"," A moving tribute: The story of Nicholas Winton, who saved hundreds of children from the Nazis just before the start of WW2 by organising trains from Czechoslovakia to the UK, is very much a story worth telling, especially as he was essentially a modest hero, one who didn't even think he deserved recognition, which makes his story all the more moving as it unfolds in flashback from late 70s Britain as Winton, superbly portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, remembers the events of the late 1930s.Of course, there have been so many WW2 dramas over the years, so I felt the pre-war scenes do somewhat lack tension and a certain freshness, but good direction and succinct writing do calmly and absorbingly set the scene, explaining those earlier events well, but we also follow the way that 40 years later the heroic efforts of Winton and his colleagues were finally revealed and celebrated, ultimately making it a truly moving and revealing film. Perhaps, considering how things look today, it's also a reminder of how good really can triumph over evil and cynicism, and it's finally a superb tribute to a remarkable man.~brockfal rated 8/10 on 28 December 2023"," Powerful: All One Life has to do to honour its true story is tell it with care and competency and that's exactly what it does. This is a deeply affecting story of selfless people who did everything they could to save as many people as possible whilst others just ignored what was going on.Anthony Hopkins is on terrific form here. He embodies the selflessness effortlessly and brings a heartbreaking sense of defeat, focusing on what he could've done rather than what he achieved. He's also one of the rare actors who can make you cry by bringing on the waterworks, when he cries you cry.In the flashbacks Johnny Flynn is an extremely convincing younger version of Hopkins with that same desire to always do more. Helena Bonham Carter gets a loveable role supporting Flynn with a stern determination and refusal to take no for an answer.James Hawes directs with a level of technical competency that's designed to go unnoticed. The production value is reminiscent of a high end BBC production, which is obviously very fitting and the pacing is really strong. Undoubtedly helped by spending the majority of the time in the flashbacks which are rife with tension.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 1 January 2024"," An inspirational true story: The story is fairly well known now, at least in the UK, but hopefully this film will bring it to the world. The film brings the story to life and how daunting and hopeless the task seemed to begin with. I had previously assumed Nicholas Winton had some sort of link to the establishment in order to get the necessary visas and other requirements. In fact, he was just an ordinary guy who felt he had to do something and, with other ordinary people, tackled each problem methodically and was able to overcome all hurdles to bring 669 mainly Jewish children out of pre-war Prague - almost certainly saving their lives.So inspiring and, indeed, heroic.With such a story, it is difficult to think that the film would not be pretty good just on that alone. However, I have seen inspiring stories fumbled before. That is not the case here. To my eyes it was handled with a deft touch aided by great performances from the ensemble cast, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helena Bonham Carter.As one might expect, the 2 timelines of pre-war Prague and the near present when the story came to light are run in parallel and that works very well, with each being moving in their own way. Together is something of an emotional overload - but in a good way. Nicky did so much but was also traumatised by those he was not able to save. Seeing all those alive today because of his efforts must have been cathartic. There is a touch of It's a Wonderful Life about the film - which is never a bad thing.The message that determined ordinary people can make a difference facing daunting obstacles is timeless. This is a true story and so not just empty rhetoric. Also, about caring for others, particularly in the face of man's ongoing inhumanity to man. Hopefully this film will inspire future Nicholas Wintons.~lawrencep0 rated 9/10 on 12 October 2023"," Exceptional piece of work: This is truly an exceptional piece of work. Having seen the trailer it could've easily been made to look and feel quite tacky but I was genuinely surprised and extremely impressed by what has been accomplished. Every step of the production was presented exactly as you would want from a time period piece and I don't recall seeing any cgi at all and certainly none which could've potentially shattered the illusion. The commitment of the actors, both past and present versions were magnificent and made you completely believe their situations. The story is an exceptional one and I'm glad that it has been told in exactly the way it was & it absolutely destroyed me & I don't think there was a dry eye left from anyone in the cinema screening that I watched it in. Anything which gives me the immediate emotional reaction that this did means that it deserves a full 5 stars.~karlmartin-47352 rated 10/10 on 1 January 2024"," Superb storytelling Superb performances: My Review - One LifeIn Cinemas nowMy Rating 10/10Before I begin this review I have to say that it was impossible for me not to be moved by Nicholas Winton story without looking at it through the prism of World events today, in the hope that perhaps there is a Nicholas Winton working in the background to save the innocent children caught up in todays war torn world.One of the end credits of this fine movie states that Nicholas Winton left his scrapbook to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel . My hope is that the politicians in Israel look at this scrapbook and learn its lessons as was Nicholas Winton's wish for his legacy to teach rather than preach.Already more than 6,600 Palestinian children that's ten times more than the 660 children Nicholas Winton helped rescue have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Gaza and not forgetting the estimated 535 children killed in the conflict in Ukraine .The movie One Life skilfully directed by James Hawkes is based on the true story of British humanitarian Nicholas Winton .The role of young Nicholas Winton is played by Johnny Flynn who perfectly compliments his older self played by Anthony Hopkins .Anthony Hopkins in my opinion is one of the most skilful actors in the business today . Every one of his performances is a masterclass study in understanding empathy and humility rarely does his characterisation seem forced or contrived that can't be said of many actors.One Life is set in two eras 1938 to 1939 during the beginning of World War 11 when the German Army occupied and invaded Czechoslovakia .Then nearly 50 years later in 1987 Anthony Hopkins as the elderly Nicholas Winton looks back on his past efforts to help groups of Jewish children in German-occupied Czechoslovakia .A humble quiet man not seeking notoriety but wanting his experience to be preserved in an effort to perhaps stop the same events occurring again is thrust into the limelight of a television show with an amazing result.We see how the traumatic events on his arrival in Prague when he first witnesses the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the cruel Nazi regime prompts him to initiate an escape plan for the children of targeted parents in an effort to avoid their obvious fate if left to the mercy of the invading German army.With the help of his colleagues in Prague and his mother Babette Winton played by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter in one of her best supporting roles in years he forms the life saving operation known asthe Czech Kindertransport .His mother battles the government bureaucracy back home in an effort to locate foster parents and visas to bring the children to freedom in England while Nicholas Winton and his team in Prague organise transport and try to locate the lists of endangered children from the Jewish authorities after gaining their trust.Wonderful ensemble supporting performances from Romola Garai, Alex Sharp, Jonathan Pryce, Lena Olin. Tom Glenister, Samantha Spiro and many more bring this emotional heartfelt true story to life on screen.It's so wonderful for this moviegoer to end 2023 with 2 movies in a row that I consider among the best of the year , especially on Sir Anthony Hopkin's 86th Birthday may you be blessed with many more days One at a Time.~tm-sheehan rated 10/10 on 31 December 2023"," Heartbreaking & Heartwarming: I rarely concern myself with the opinions of others, especially professional critics, but some of the negative reviews I've read about this are churlish to say the least. I think one of the big positives of this film is that it just tells the story. Most of us in UK probably know the story of Sir Nicholas Winton and how he organised the transport of 669 Czech Jewish children to relative safety in the UK in the face of the Nazi onslaught in the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. Despite what some suggest, it clearly shows that this is a team effort led by Winton's persistence and determination; it does not make him out to be the sole hero. However, as important as the evacuations is the story about how it came into the British consciousness via the quirky 1970s BBC TV show, 'That's Life.' It truly is something that needed to be told, then and now, and is done so in a suitably serious nut heartwarming manner. Do go and see it and do be prepared for the final scenes.~GB65 rated 9/10 on 1 January 2024"

Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/~gogoschka-1 rated 10/10 on 17 December 2013"," An Offer You Can't Refuse...: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N. Y. 1955.Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 31 March 2003"," The best mobster film ever made: After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.""Goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss ""Big Paulie"" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.~AlsExGal rated 10/10 on 18 November 2009"," A great director at the peak of his talents: It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 10/10 on 9 January 2011"," One word: priceless: If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.~mhasheider rated 10/10 on 6 November 2004"," The greatest mob film still today: Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+~OriginalMovieBuff21 rated 10/10 on 11 April 2005"," The Definitive Film of the 1990s: ""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 21 July 2000"," The Criminal Mindset: The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must.~bkoganbing rated 9/10 on 15 February 2007"," Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).: 'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!~Infofreak rated NA on 17 March 2003"," The Mob...Revealed: The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to ""score"" more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990.~arthurclay rated NA on 29 August 2004"

""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.~Gordon-11 rated NA on 19 October 2009"," Awesome: The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""~ebiros2 rated 10/10 on 17 October 2005"," One of the best movies ever made.: Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 26 January 2023"," Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.: Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.~Fella_shibby rated 10/10 on 9 September 2013"," You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.: History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.~mark.waltz rated 10/10 on 29 August 2014"," Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely. ⭐: As you may know there is lots of World War II movies.

It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.~vtburns rated NA on 11 December 2000"," Spielberg's most important work: Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

FBI agent Carl becomes obsessed with tracking down the con man, who only revels in the pursuit."," Witty con man.: From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.~jotix100 rated 10/10 on 24 January 2003"," A lot of fun: While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.~rbverhoef rated 9/10 on 8 June 2003"," Very good film has those Spielberg edges!: At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.~rosscinema rated 7/10 on 18 March 2003"," Top-notch, brilliantly crafted entertainment, rich with fascinating details, memorable incidents and engaging performances: What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams's delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his ""manipulation,"" i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I've seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy's selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I'm especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.Spielberg's movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible. This is top-notch entertainment.~J. Spurlin rated NA on 5 June 2010"," Hard to believe its true: I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10~mjw2305 rated 8/10 on 17 January 2005"," Brilliant, especially DiCaprio: On Leonardo DiCaprio's 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn't realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on 'Growing Pains'--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn't see much to like about ""Titanic"" except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, 'Romeo and Juliet' was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his 'Aviator' performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"", or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in ""Smokey and the Bandit"". The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from 'To Tell the Truth' was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn't feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn't seem to agree.~vchimpanzee rated NA on 11 November 2005"," A film well worth catching: 'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 31 January 2017"," Slick and enjoyable story telling: When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home.  He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.Based on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.The presentation is good.  Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.The cast is good even if they aren't all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!~bob the moo rated NA on 25 December 2003"," Caught me: One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"".Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or ""concurs"" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.~tomsview rated 9/10 on 13 May 2014"," Captivating DiCaprio, engaging story: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) **** Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Frank John Hughes, Brian Howe, John Finn, Jennifer Garner.  DiCaprio gives a grandly charming performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. a teenager who adopted the professional guises of airplane pilot, physician and lawyer to front his check kiting schematic modus operandi during the 1960s and eventually making the FBI's most wanted list by bilking millions until his capture and imprisonment.  Based on Abagnale's best-selling memoir and adapted with lean storytelling by Jeff Nathanson, the film never lets up in the giddy cat-and-mouse/Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote relationship between fugitive DiCaprio and amalgamated FBI square Hanks (replete with thick as clam chowder Boston accent, dorky specs and porkpie hat) one step behind his two-steps ahead prey and a unique dynamic of a father/son esthetic.  Walken gives an Oscar worthy supporting turn as the elder Abagnale whose financial woes and tanglement with the IRS acts as his son's catalyst.

As I write this review ""House of Gucci"" has a score of 6.9 which is baffling to me, as the film I sat through last Saturday was an unmitigated disaster. One that's story is too boring to even allow you to enjoy the hilariously bad performances.Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a party. Maurizio is the son of Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) who owns 50% of the family named fashion chain. Initially training to be a lawyer, Patrizia, along with his uncle Aldo, (Al Pacino) encourages Maurizio to join the family business. Very quickly, lines of division are drawn, and alliances and double crosses push Maurizio to the head of the company.I am not the first person to come here and make fun of some of the performances. Adam Driver and Lady Gaga can leave with their reputations relatively unscathed, even if perhaps Gaga hones an accent that's a bit more Transylvanian than Milanese. Al Pacino and Jared Leto though are in a different film, with broad comedic performances that make the Dolmio adverts look like Mike Leigh in comparison.I could, perhaps, forgive their choices if the overall film hung together better, but alas it doesn't. The story is glacial at some points, but at others either skips over or brushes through sections that are required to make the story make sense. Why do the police come after Maurizio as quickly as they do? How does the information about Aldo's taxes make it to the American authorities? What does Maurizio actually do, once he's taken control? Why does he abandon his wife and child after one brief argument? The story needs Patrizia to be Lady Macbeth, subtly twisting and cajoling her unwilling husband to power, before he turns on her and she extracts revenge. Instead though, Maurizio's whole personality changes in a moment, without that much justification, and he moves on without her. Also, I never really had the right feel for how much time has passed between scenes, and I'm not helped by the score, which seems to use anachronistic songs, but at others tries to evoke the period.In lesser hands, this might be more forgivable, but this is Ridley Scott and we've come to expect more. This was, in no uncertain terms, a shambles.~southdavid rated 2/10 on 13 December 2021"," Very odd and uneven but also quite fun and intriguing: There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.For me though, bigger selling points were seeing two of my favourite actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons again (and reunited after 'A Merchant in Venice'). Jared Leto has always been very take and leave. 'House of Gucci' turned out to be one of those difficult to rate and review sort of films for me, it is going to be one of those films that some are going to love and others are going to hate (with some in between). It is a hugely flawed film, but there was also a lot to enjoy at the same time. As far as Scott's films go, it's a middling effort. Neither one of his best or worst.'House of Gucci' has a lot that is good in my view. Have very little to complain about when it comes to how it looks, apart from some editing being in need of a tightening in the final act. The Italian scenery and the costumes are truly stunning though and the camerawork is similarly sumptuous. Scott's direction is uneven dramatically but is very impressive on a technical level, especially in his use of multiple cameras (which must make it easy for actors to know where to look). The soundtrack is also wonderful and beautifully operatic in scope, though not always well placed, but from a standalone point of view there are no complaints here.Despite the very all over the place accents, with a mix of exaggerated (Leto, to almost cartoonish effect in his case) or barely there (Irons, am a huge fan of Irons but will never deny about accents not being a forte of his), most of the acting is fine. Lady Gaga kills it as Patrizia, who is a very interesting and well fleshed out character here, bringing charm, effortless charisma and menace to her. It has been said that her accent isn't great, as far as the cast goes it's actually the most convincing one along with Salma Hayek's. Adam Driver is a good deal more understated, one of the few in the cast to play it very straight, but he is also compelling and his character growth/decent is believable. They have great chemistry together.The supporting cast on the whole support them well, Pacino coming off best having a whale of a time as Aldo. Irons brings vulnerability and authority to patriarch Rodolfo and Salma Hayek gives some of her best acting in years. Really liked the chemistry on the whole, Lady Gaga and Driver are great together as are Lady Gaga and Hayek, while that between Irons and Pacino is a joy. 'House of Gucci' does have a few great individual scenes, and one of the best is the magnificent encounter between Irons and Pacino. Personally thought the first half was fine and that it set up the intrigue and characters extremely well. As well as a few funny moments, Rodolfo's verbal brutalising of Paolo was gold and sums up the viewer's opinion of him and his work perfectly.On the other hand, 'House of Gucci' has a number of shortcomings. One performance didn't work for me and that was Leto. Unrecognisable in much talked about(the talk of social media when advertising was first revealed) makeup that deserves its own film, he overplays his role, especially when the comic relief becomes more dominant, and belongs in a completely different film. Yes the film is very over the top in tone, but Leto's performance veered on excess and too much of a Super Mario Brothers caricature. There are pacing issues, the rather underdeveloped family business stuff drags, sometimes to the point of stalling, due to the lack of tension and gravitas that was not there enough. And other parts come over as very choppy and incomplete feeling, like the final act. The second half needed a tightening up, which would have made the film less overlong (and it is a film that could have been 25 minutes shorter easily).Also found the ending very rushed and anti-climactic, handled with too much of an indifferent shrug. After spending so long on the family stuff (and not developing that enough) and the increasingly uneasy spurts of comedy, the event that caused such a sensation is just too throwaway in treatment. Tonally, 'House of Gucci' is messy, the comedy going for the campy approach that goes too far into pantomime in the second half and some of the serious moments being too melodramatic. Tonal shifts can be uneasily abrupt.The script has some funny and intriguing moments, but is on the whole too overwritten in tone (Leto's comedy increasingly gets too much), bland emotionally (the descent into revenge is not examined enough) and also too much of a trying to include as many iconic lines as possible. Some of the line delivery has to be heard to be believed, can imagine right now the amount of reaction gifs online in regard to some of the more comedic lines and Leto's body language.Concluding, hugely flawed but also quite fun when taking it for what it is. 5.5/10 (was struggling which score of 5 or 6 to give it but decided to go in between and round it up)~TheLittleSongbird rated 6/10 on 29 November 2021"," all about the accent: It's 1978 Milan. Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a nightclub. He is the heir to a large portion of the fashion house Gucci but his father disapproves of her supposed mafia family although they only own a small trucking company. He marries her anyways and his father disowns him.For me, this is all about the accent. Everybody is speaking English but in an overt Italian accent. It's distracting. As a story, I would concentrate more on the murder and the decline feels rushed. At least, it should be equal to the rest of the movie. Maybe this needs to be a limited series on a streaming service. The acting seems to be getting accolades. I don't mind that. They're doing good work. The accent is just not my preference. All in all, this is a functional biopic with interesting actors doing a specific choice.~SnoopyStyle rated 6/10 on 10 February 2022"," Impressive visuals but underwhelming conclusion: ""House of Gucci"" is a beautifully shot picture with great people involved. It is somewhat underwhelming and a tad too long, but there are great moments sprinkled throughout the movie.The film is based on the real murder of Maurizio Gucci and the downfall of the Gucci family. It all begins when Patrizia Reggiani marries into the Gucci family and the rest is history.Lady Gaga is great as the ambitious Patrizia Reggiani but she is also inconsistent with her performance. Pacino, Driver and Leto are good per usual. It is however a daring choice by the filmmakers to have the actors speak in English with an Italian accent. It is not a huge problem, but it does occasionally take the viewer out of the experience.The first forty minutes of the movie are great. The characters are well introduced, and the plot is intriguing. The rest of the movie does not maintain this standard. The last 30 minutes are beyond underwhelming and the climax is cold and emotionless.There are issues with ""House of Gucci"" but the production design is not one of them. The film is beautifully shot and the locations look great. ""House of Gucci"" is very stylish and the costume department really outdid themselves.With everything said, ""House of Gucci"" is a decent film with outstanding visuals and great acting. If you like fashion, then you should give this movie a watch. It is beautiful and quite enjoyable despite its excessive runtime.~lovemichaeljordan rated 7/10 on 27 November 2021"," A baffling story, a very long film.: House of Gucci is probably the most stylish film of 2021, it looked awesome, this was beautifully made, the quality of production and direction is phenomenal. It isn't just style over substance though, it's well made, generally well acted, it tells a fascinating and twisted story.The main issue about this film for me, was the pacing, it was somewhat uneven, at times it felt frustratingly slow, fortunately it did pick up at its conclusion. The running time was overlong, what is it with films in 2021? Why the need for everything to be almost three hours? Is there some deal for cost per minute at cinemas? Ninety minute films work too.If you ever think your family has problems, just watch this, and you'll see what family problems really are. Scandal, betrayal and murder, it's a rags to riches story with a twist.The acting, for the most part I thought it was great, Jeremy Irons was the standout for me, as he so often is, but Lady Gaga was awesome as Patrizia, she did a great job. Adam Driver on the other hand, I'm not sure why, but I felt as though he was a little uninterested, perhaps a little bored?6/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 6/10 on 2 January 2022"," With more detail, different casting, and definitely better script writers, the movie could have been better.: House of Gucci is a new crime drama directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Alien.The film is inspired by true events surrounding the family behind the Italian fashion house Gucci. When Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) begins a relationship with the outsider Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), he is disinherited by his father Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons). He suspects that Patrizia is behind Maurizio's family money. That's how the two have to make it without the support of the Gucci family. Years later, the two are married and have a child together. Maurizio's uncle Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) thus contacts him again and brings him back into the family business. The Gucci fashion house is once again going under multiple names, leading to creative differences, exposing betrayal, revenge and even murder cases.There have been many changes in the making of this film. Martin Scorsese, for example, could have directed the film at first, but Ridley Scott was eventually given a directing position. Together with the casting directors, he also had many ideas for the casting of the roles before they finally came to the chosen actors and actresses.After the many changes in casting and direction, they probably should have looked back at the writing crew of the film, because the final script was written by more novice writers, which can sometimes be seen in the film. The story can sometimes seem a bit messy and so long-winded, because the story makes many jumps in time. Some relationships come across as rushed, which can cause some loss of credibility.What comes out best in the film about a well-known fashion brand is therefore the costumes and make-up of the characters. Janty Yates can expect film award nominations for this. Still, the film has received complaints from actual members of the Gucci family that the relatives were better dressed in real life compared to the actors in the film. They also credibly convey the places where the story takes place.Al Pacino comes out the best of the film cast and knows how to provide the best and most believable accent compared to the entire cast. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver have good chemistry together in the film, but their relationship sometimes comes across as weak. Patrizia is clearly showing signs that she is more behind the Gucci family's money than she really loves Maurizio. Their accents can also come across as a bit unusual. Lady Gaga has more of an Eastern European accent than real Italian. Her characters seem to come more from Russia in some scenes. Of the entire cast, Salma Hayek is the only one who has received help with speaking in the correct accent. This is probably because she is married to the man who now owns the Gucci brand. If they had helped the entire cast a little more with their accents in the film, they would have come across a bit more like people from the same country. Who even seems to play in a completely different film is Jared Leto, because in the film he wears a fattening costume and also has a strange shaved hair style. In the film, he comes across as too exaggerated compared to the rest and speaks excessively in a high-pitched voice. He sometimes sounds just like the video game character Mario.~movieman6-413-929510 rated 5/10 on 28 November 2021"," A Tonal Nightmare With A Mind Of Its Own: A film so out of its mind that it is operating entirely on impulses, House of Gucci makes for a wild, inconsistent & unabashedly over-the-top biographical crime drama that chronicles the downfall of the Gucci family dynasty without any intent or interest and is surprisingly fuelled by absolutely unhinged performances, each functioning on a separate wavelength and pointed in a different direction.Directed by Ridley Scott, this tonal nightmare plays out like an (un)intentional parody of the Oscar-bait biopics and is far from the quality of work we expect from the filmmaker at helm. All its elements are at odds with each other, thus resulting in a film so bonkers & unpredictable in its approach & execution that it actually piques the curiosity in a way that's not just unusual or unexpected but also nonsensical.However, a story treatment this uneven & erratic can only carry on for a while before the appeal goes away and this one goes on for 157 long minutes, all of which is tediously paced. The characters themselves are mere caricatures and the ensemble cast is given the license to render them as such. But none of the actors are ever on the same level or looking for any kind of harmony even when sharing screen together.Overall, House of Gucci is inarguably the ""so bad it's good"" film of the year. Laced with irony, drowning in decadence and incongruous in each n every aspect, this overlong & overbearing train-wreck suffers from issues of its own makings and despite boasting an A-list ensemble, it doesn't utilise a shred of their talents. Inadvertently hilarious & downright mediocre, Ridley Scott's latest is what happens when the entire cast n crew is left unsupervised & goes amok.~CinemaClown rated NA on 2 February 2022"," A movie with a lot of potential, completely wasted. Many sequences feel odd, empty and unnecessary.: ""House of Gucci"" portrays Maurizio Gucci and Patrizia Reggiani, trying to expand the family business. Gucci in the 60s was already a big empire and as an outsider that never really cared about fashion, I am not really sure what was the point of this motion picture. The film shows how Maurizio took over the company with his unethical methods, but aside from ruining completely the relationship with his own family members, it seems that he did not accomplish anything. He improved nothing in the business and took the enterprise to the verge of bankruptcy, so he did more harm than good. Patrizia Reggiani was for the whole time so manipulative, and I hated her character for the whole time. She was in fact after the Gucci money. Maurizio should have listened to his father. The beginning of their relationship is portrayed in such a childish and immature way. I refuse to believe that this is what really happened between the two. At this point I would have preferred to watch a film about Aldo Gucci, and how he managed to transform a small business into such a big and rich company. It would have been way more interesting and at least I would have walked out of the theatre with a little bit more knowledge.A lot of scenes feel odd, empty and pointless. Lady Gaga is stunning and gave a decent performance, but they could have hired someone more competent. She is an excellent singer, but please, keep her away from acting. I really enjoyed Adam Driver and Al Pacino. Jared Leto's acting was different and quite funny, he was a pleasant surprise, and he added a lot of value to the film. From a technical perspective, the photography was smooth and simple and perfectly matched the mood of the film.I have to be honest: I had quite big expectations for this one, but I was extremely disappointed. I went to see this movie mainly because of the director and the cast. I know nothing about fashion or Gucci, maybe I am not in the target area, but still I think that they could have done so much more with a big brand such as this one. The plot has its good moments and it is entertaining enough to keep me until the end, even though I would have cut a couple of scenes. It is not a bad production, but I think that this was an unnecessary and uninspired movie. I would recommend waiting for the release of ""House of Gucci"" on some streaming service or on Blu-ray. For me it is not worth going to the cinema for it.~fciocca rated 5/10 on 5 December 2021"," When Americans pretend to be Italian...: The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.Yet Gaga is still a relative unknown in Hollywood-speak. She made her big breakthrough in the 2018 music film A Star is Born. Scott, as he did in The Last Duel, has assembled an incomparable star ensemble. Adam Driver, who seems to be establishing himself as the director's new darling, evergreens Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons and an unrecognisable Jared Leto embody the key roles in the Gucci clan. In addition, Salma Hayek emerges as a kind of mentor for Gaga's character. But who is Gaga playing anyway? She is the young and rebellious Patrizia Reggiani. An extroverted perennial who worms her way into the millionaire family with charm and fascination. She is courted by the ambitious Maurizio Gucci, played by Driver, who actually wants to leave the intrigues and sometimes shabby business dealings of his predecessors behind. Once he falls in love with Patrizia and marries her, he is left with no choice but to get involved again. Driver and Gaga share a very passionate chemistry in the first act, which you fully buy into with little dialogue and through pure body language. While Driver plays rather reserved and shy, this quality emanates especially from Gaga, who doesn't hold back in any of her intimate scenes. At least the two characters are able to unfold their own approaches here. But when Al Pacino's character Aldo Gucci, Maurizio's uncle, insists on his nephew's re-entry into the family business, the two lose all closeness to each other. Rather, it is only an extremely manipulative relationship that both actors have to show in a few scenes. All the more Aldo and his son Paolo Gucci, portrayed by Leto, come to the fore. From this point on, the film lapses into a few minutes of megalomania, largely due to Leto's performance. He is exclusively eccentric and desperate and all in all a tragic figure. Whether you find this Super Mario caricature brilliant or miserable is a matter of interpretation.House of Gucci begins extremely quietly and shows the rise of the lovers in well-done visual sequences. The performances are generally fitting and although the film seems anti-Italian, I love it when Adam Driver cruises through Milan on his Vespa. But as interesting as the pecking order and hierarchy within the Gucci family is, from the second act onwards the film devolves into an overplayed and hyperactive tragedy that, despite the craziness of its scenes and actors, actually manages to be long-winded. Fashion, creativity and the business idea are not a theme at all, which in no way brings us closer to this brand that is so present. In the end we have a family epic (the film lasts 2 ½ hours), with exclusively unsympathetic characters. One more request to Ridley Scott: just let your actors speak English and don't embarrass them with Italian stereotypes with accents.~severindringel rated 5/10 on 26 November 2021"," the joys of family: Greetings again from the darkness. I've never purchased or owned anything Gucci, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the heck out of Ridley Scott's film that brings the longest, most expensive and dangerous real life episode of 'Family Feud' to the big screen. It's co-written by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, and is based on the 2001 book, ""House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden. Brace yourself for a (mostly) true wild ride, and for what is likely to be one of the year's most divisive films - plenty of love and hate (just like the actual story).What happens when a brand is so closely associated with a family name? The arguments begin on who 'deserves' to be a Gucci, who is a 'real' Gucci, and who should make the decisions that impact the Gucci family and business wealth and reputation. During the extended run time (2 hours, 37 minutes), we see many of the iconic Gucci items: the Flora scarf, the moccasins, the bamboo bag, and the watches. And though high fashion is always present, director Scott has delivered a spectacle of romance, family riffs, extravagance, greed, power, betrayal, revenge, and crime.Lady Gaga (Oscar winner, A STAR IS BORN, 2018) stars as Patrizia, the newest Gucci. Hers is not blind ambition, but rather calculated and laser-focused. That she implodes a dysfunctional family is only a portion of the story. After marrying Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), Patrizia immediately begins manipulating her husband into reconciling with his family and taking on an active role in a business for which he previously had little interest. This is simply step two (the first was marriage) in her grand scheme to control the business and the money. Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, 1990) is ailing, so it's Uncle Aldo (Oscar winner Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN, 1992) to whom Patrizia directs her attention. She plays it like a chess match - only this is more entertaining to watch unfold.Also in the picture is Paolo Gucci (a truly unrecognizable Jared Leto, Oscar winner, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB), Aldo's son, and a family outcast. Paolo is a wildly creative individual who tends to his pet pigeons and tries desperately to find his place in the family. Jack Huston plays Dominico De Sole, Rodolfo's consigliere and the family attorney. Each of the characters is given their time in the spotlight, including a terrific breakfast scene with Pacino and Irons. Of course this is mostly Patrizia's story, so it's Lady Gaga's performance that will attract much of the attention and commentary. I found her mesmerizing and twisted fun to watch as she proceeded with backstabbing and trickery. Driver's quietly intense approach makes the perfect contrast to hers.If you are familiar with the story, you know that Maurizio does eventually run the company, and he also tires of Patrizia's family-crushing antics ... which send him back into the arms of Paola Franchi (Camile Cottin, STILLWATER, 2021). This turns the campy and juicy melodrama factor up to 11 (on the Spinal Tap scale). Patrizia's frequent trips to fortune teller and TV psychic Pina Auriemma (Salma Hayek) cause a massive tonal shift in the film, leading to the well-documented conclusion. If all this isn't strange enough, Ms. Hayek is the real-life spouse of the CEO of Gucci's present-day parent company, Kering. Reeve Carney (""Penny Dreadful"") has a small, yet vital role as up-and-coming fashion designer Tom Ford.In this movie, it's easy to describe some performances as hammy or over-the-top, but that's likely to only hold as a first reaction. Leto's characterization of Paolo sticks out so much from the others ... but he was known as eccentric, and at best, was patronized by the family. It seems highly likely that his personality and approach stood in stark contrast to the old-school style of his father Aldo, or the more staid personalities of his Uncle Rodolfo and cousin Maurizio. Lady Gaga as Patrizia is cunning and shrewd in her calculated approach to re-structure the family and the business. She plays whatever games she must to get where she wants to be. I found her first half performance to be truly outstanding. Pacino is the actor who has trademarked hammy performances over the years, yet here, he fully grasps his role and character, and is a delight to watch.Much of this is documented by history, though the Gucci family claims not all is or was how it seems. Whether the boost in counterfeiting/knock-offs went down in the 70's and 80's as it's portrayed here, might be an area worth researching, but this is much less a case study in business principles as it is one in family dynamics. I'll certainly understand those who argue against the story structure here, but the entertainment value proved to be enough for me. As the Gucci tagline goes, ""Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten"", but the backstabbing and disloyalty is never forgotten - despite providing great theater (and fashion).Opens in theaters on November 24, 2021.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 24 November 2021"

Despite not doing big swims for the last 30 years, she decides to tackle her failed swim from Cuba to Florida when she was only 28. They hire local expert John Bartlett (Rhys Ifans) to guide them through the difficult currents.It's the true story of Nyad who is allegedly the first to swim the Florida Strait unassisted. Married couple directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi do mostly documentaries of extreme adventurers. They are dipping their toes into bigger budget fares and this one has some big name actors. Annette Bening is striped down and is not afraid of looking ugly, both outside and inside. Nyad is not the most cuddly character. Jodie Foster is simply magnificent. She is way over-qualified to be second banana. Rhys Ifans rounds out the big three. The movie follows the standard sports movie profile. I would put more of her swim during 28 year old in the opening act. They need to accentuate her failed swim which would make her decision that much more compelling. This movie has one big surprise laugh and I wouldn't mind having more. Most of all, I love the relationship between Diana and Bonnie. It helps to have two great actresses playing these lived-in characters. They make this standard sports movie come alive.~SnoopyStyle rated 7/10 on 5 November 2023"," Age is just a number.: The wonderful and uplifting story of Diana Nyad, who decides at 60 to complete her lifelong ambition, to swim from Cuba to Florida, a feat she couldn't achieve aged 28.Netflix haven't had the best time of it this year, but they certainly pulled it out of the bag with this one, it's a cracking movie.It's uplifting, it's daring, it's an adventure, a truly motivational story. Both Annette Bening and Jodie Foster are tremendous 8n third respective roles.Now, I know it's superficial to comment on people's appearances, but can I just say how wonderful it is to see two natural looking actresses, for real, how refreshing.I loved the music throughout the film, some real classics were chosen, including The Sound of Silence.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 30 November 2023"," Amazing? No. But still worth your time: In a day and age where most movies are steeped in cynicism, there's something oddly refreshing about Nyad. Yes, parts may be clunky, it may take a while to get going, and it doesn't reinvent the biopic formula, but it's still an ultimately successful crowdpleaser.In terms of its inspirational story, Nyad follows a pretty straightforward plot of the titular characters attempts to swim from Cuba to Florida. This underdog/triumph of the human spirit storyline is by no means new, but it's handled here with honesty and care. The start of things is rough-the first actual shot of Bening as Nyad is almost unintentionally funny, and it's pretty obvious that the actors are not totally comfortable with their characters early on. But, much like Nyad herself, the movie gets better over time as the technical quality improves and the actors are able to flex their skills, and by the end you're cheering right alongside the crowds for her success.Diana Nyad, as a figure, is quite complicated. There's no doubt that she's has some incredible achievements, but she's also been reported as self-centered, dishonest, and in general rather controversial. Walking in to Nyad, I feared that the filmmakers would opt to completely gloss over this to be more simple (and palatable to Oscar voters), but thankfully this is not the case. The movie chugs along with its traditional empowerment story, but along the way there's tension between Nyad and her companions as her arrogance threatens to derail the swim. A lesson about ""the power of teamwork"" may seem cliche, and to an extent, it is. But the movie's exploration of the way perceptions change based on your own humility adds an interesting texture to the proceedings that not all filmmakers would seek to include.One of the most talked-about things regarding this movie is the acting, and for the most part, it delivers. Annette Bening as Nyad is thoroughly convincing and able to sell this rather idealistic yet egocentric woman without being totally unlikable, and the physical strength it must have taken to perform the swimming is impressive. It takes a while for her to fully warm up to the role, but once she does it's a strong turn. Bening had a job and she delivered.But the star of the show here is Jodie Foster. She imbues her character with so much personality and life force that she disappears into the role and is easily the best part about the whole film. Foster's not given amazing dialogue to work with, and yet through sheer talent, she pulls the movie together to craft a complex portrait of a woman torn between dedication to her friend and her own self-actualization. If nothing else, watch this movie for her performance.In the age of streaming this is exactly the sort of thing to fall under the radar were it not for awards season, but it has more heart than most film's you can find on Netflix. This is not an incredibly well-made movie, but it doesn't need to be. The core thing that makes a story like this work is the emotional impact, and it delivers. Nyad's an imperfect but satisfying film, uplifting and well-acted enough to be worth a watch.Finally score: 68/100.~Lockout_Salties rated 7/10 on 25 October 2023"," pursuing a dream: Greetings again from the darkness. All great athletes aren't great competitors, and all great competitors aren't great athletes. But when the two merge, the result is elite. Think Michael Jordan, Muhammed Ali, Novak Djokovic, Tiger Woods, and Michael Phelps. Of course, there are others, and this biopic focuses on one you might not have previously considered since she's so unique. Diana Nyad was a world class distance swimmer and had a tremendous career prior to becoming an analyst and commentator for ABC Sports. She had a career that made her famous in her field and a well-respected sports personality ... but that's not what made her the focus of this film from co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, the Oscar winning duo behind the extraordinary documentary FREE SOLO (2018).In 2010, after a surprise 60th birthday party thrown for her by her friend Bonnie Stoll, Diana Nyad made up her mind to make the ""Mount Everest"" of open water swims ... from Cuba to Florida. Mind you, Nyad had failed on her attempt at this swim when she was 28 years old and in peak form. And yes, everyone thought she was a bit crazy and tried to talk her out of it. The swim is 103 miles, and the dangers included box jellyfish, sharks, and unpredictable weather and currents, not to mention the stamina and physical health required. But Diana would not be swayed from her goal.Annette Bening stars as Nyad, and two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster co-stars as best friend Bonnie. As remarkable as Nyad's marathon swim goal was, much of the film focuses on the journey of friendship between Diana and Bonnie, especially once Bonnie takes on the role of coach and trainer. Their relationship (and the actors' performances) is the strength of the film. We feel the love and the frustrations. Diana's extreme level of determination (and hard-headedness) is paired with her equally extreme level of self-absorption and narcissism. Bonnie's loyalty is tested daily and over many years.Why many years? The answer to that is in the number of failures Nyad experiences on her quest to complete the swim. The multiple attempts allow us to get familiar with the crew, especially navigator John Bartlett, played by the always interesting Rhys Ifans. The relationship between the crew and the swimmer builds the bridge between isolation and team sport. We see Diana use 4/4 music for the rhythm of her strokes and to keep her mind from wandering (or worse). The mental aspect of distance swimming is just as challenging as the physical side.The story continues through 2013 at age 64, when we learn that the rules mean both ankles must be out of the water for the swim to count ... this after more than two full days and nights of swimming. Screenwriter Julia Cox has adapted the story from Diana Nyad's memoir, ""Find a Way"", and Oscar winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (LIFE OF PI) works wonders in capturing the enormity of the swim as well as the intimacy of this deep friendship and the commitment of the crew.Flashbacks of Diana's childhood are shown, which clue us in on what motivated her to push her body and mind to extremes. The film begins with a recap of Nyad's swimming career to ensure that viewers understand what a decorated athlete she was. Annette Bening is terrific here and it will be interesting to see if, after four previous nominations, this is the role that delivers that elusive gold statue. As for Jodie Foster, her rare screen appearances make it too easy to forget just how amazing she can be - it's nice to be reminded (be on the lookout for her in the new season of ""True Detective"" next year). Music by two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat works well on the swims, and Nyad's dreams (and misses) inspire us to pursue our own ... even if our dreams are a bit less dramatic than ""Mount Everest.""Opens in select theaters on October 20, 2023 and streams on Netflix November 3, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 19 October 2023"," Conventional but still really good: Nyad is an incredible true story told in a pretty standard biopic fashion. It's a testament to never giving up, showing that there's still so much to be accomplished in later life but what helps this film really swim instead of sinking in a sea of similar competition is the two screen icons at the centre of it all.Annette Bening has a physically demanding role that she embodies convincingly and equally impressive is how she makes Diana Nyad self obsessed without being irredeemable. Jodie Foster is superb, it's always so nice when she comes back and the chemistry between them is really strong.It's built on Foster's constant support and the moment it's pushed to a breaking point that leads to the most satisfying moment with Bening gaining a newfound appreciation for others' sacrifices. Rhys Ifans has truly found his shtick, adding another gruff character with a heart of gold to his back catalogue.Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin do a good job of merging the style of their documentaries with a more traditional biopic. It's only the more surreal moments that don't really work but they're still visually exciting and something a little unique in something that's mostly operating on the well worn formula.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 3 November 2023"," Annette Benning's full commitment to the part just like Nyad herself: This movie will tug at your heartstrings as it truly has an inspirational ending. I vaguely remember this news story back from 2013, and frankly the subject matter itself does not lure me in; instead I tune in because of Jodie Foster and Annette Benning. So that proves that those two acting legends are a wise choice for this production. Annette Benning's commitment to portray Diana Nyad with all her might almost equals the level of commitment and almost-insanity that Nyad herself exhibited during her quest to do the long-distance swim in her 60s. Jodie Foster further adds that extra layer of poignancy with her intense performance. I am glad for having seen the movie, but this feels more like a solid, uplifting documentary that happens to be reenacted, as opposed to a movie made to entertain you.~julieshotmail rated 7/10 on 7 November 2023"," Godot on the water: I thought this could be boring but was a little interested, as I have placed a toe in the water of ""endurance"" with a few marathons over the years and an ironman at 70. These efforts are a 50 metre jog compared to what Diana Nyad attempted in the proposed swim from Cuba to Florida (110 miles). She had failed when younger but decided to try again at 60.The subject matter is not intrinsically exciting but the film is saved by good direction from Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo), a clever script and excellent acting throughout, - especially from the 2 leads Annette Bening and Jodie Foster. I have met a few of these ""ultra"" people, utterly consumed by their current passion, the latest gruelling masochistic challenge, which has blotted out their view of anything or anyone else around them. Bening has wonderfully captured this character (- ?psychopathology). The single purposed mania to achieve 'this' - leavened by the occasional sobering insight of the selfishness and, maybe, craziness of it all. The friendship between the 2 ladies was well drawn and affecting.I found the film surprisingly absorbing. To witness a great athlete with inspiring self-belief, the drama of the swim(s) and to see 2 talented actors at the height of their craft, was worth seeing.~Jaffaroll rated 8/10 on 23 October 2023"," Annette Bening's performance towers over this film: As ""Nyad"" (2023 release; 121 min) opens, we see news footage from the mid-late 1970s when marathon swimmer Diane Nyad sets several marks. We then go to ""Los Angeles, August 22, 2010"" and Nyad decides that she is going to try and swim from Havana to Key West, even though she is now 60 and she failed in her earlier attempt 30 years ago... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Oscar-winning co-directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi andJimmy Chin (""Free Solo""). Here they look at another extreme sport (marathon swimming) but rather than doing a documentary about Nyad, they decide to do a biopic recreating the events. I very much respect the co-directors, and have seen most of their movies. That said, the movie succeeds mostly because of Annette Bening's fearless performance. Yes, Jodie Foster is good too, but nowhere near the level of Bening, sorry. There is also a pleasant original score, courtesy of Oscar-winning Alexandre Desplat. There are several things I didn't like about the movie but since they related to ""plot', I'll remain silent and you can figure it out yourself.""Nyad"" premiered at the Telluride film festival a few months back, to good critical acclaim. After a one week US theatrical run in selected cities, it started streaming on Netflix last weekend.

A real story by the way and not fiction.She didn't try this once or twice, she did this five times, and on her 5th try, she fulfilled her DREAM.What an incredible woman with that kind of willpower.Once in a while, I feel we humans need to watch these kinds of movies to refill our souls/minds with ''you can do it too, don't give up''.Whatever we humans go through, whatever we struggle with, when we see these kinds of movies, it ignites some kind of fire in us to continue to do the things we need to do. To continue to go after our dreams and if we fall down, it's ok, and let's get up again and continue.I have no idea what kind of fire Diana had inside her to keep going after this dream, but she went for it and fulfilled her dream.I always wonder what kind of superpower these folks have that goes after this stuff and doesn't give up.Diana is truly an extraordinary human, with some kind of spirit that doesn't know what ''comfortable'' means.

The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017) - IMDb,7.0,Dan Stevens|Mark Schrier|Patrick Joseph Byrnes|Miriam Margolyes|Morfydd Clark|Justin Edwards|Cosimo Fusco|Jasper Hughes Cotter|James Heffernan|Aleah Lennon|Ella Mai Delaney|Donna Marie Sludds|David McSavage|Ian McNeice|Miles Jupp|Pat Mooney|Anna Murphy|Jonathan Pryce,Bharat Nalluri,Susan Coyne|Les Standiford|Charles Dickens,"The journey that led to Charles Dickens' creation of ""A Christmas Carol,"" a timeless tale that would redefine Christmas."," Enjoyable background film on Dickens and ""A Christmas Carol"": ""The Man Who Invented Christmas"" is a fictional biographical look at famed English author, Charles Dickens, and the circumstances of his life and time that led to the writing and publication of ""A Christmas Carol."" The full title by Dickens then was ""A Christmas Carol in Prose: Being a Ghost-story of Christmas."" Dickens first published it himself in 1843, after a falling out with his regular publishers.From start to scratch, it took Dickens just six weeks to give the world what would become one of the great classic stories of all time. At least, that's the premise of the film, which itself is based on a 2011 novel of the same title by Les Standiford. The book's subtitle explains a little more, lest there be any confusion regarding the much older Christmas origins of St. Nicholas and of the birth of Jesus. It's about ""How Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol Rescued His Career and Revived Our Holiday Spirits.""According to some reviews, Standiford did considerable research for his book. The background on Dickens's family, his writing to that time, and his precarious financial situation then is likely in public records. Still, much of that part of the story is interesting and probably not that well known by most people, including fans of Dickens books. The very colorful segments of imagination in this movie are another matter. How much of that may have been able to be traced to notes by Dickens himself, or to other sources, is uncertain. But, this serves as a very good technique for the author, and the filmmakers, to get across to a non-writing public how a great story teller may come to the plots and characters of a book he or she will write. After all, who can't remember a time as a child when one's thoughts roamed freely into a world of make-believe?So, what we would come to call day-dreaming, is a very likely and real way that Dickens, and some other authors like him (surely, the great story-tellers, at least) would have thought up and developed their plots and characters. And, the interplay of the hero's daydreams here, with constant interruptions from family and friends, helps one understand the frustrations and difficulties Dickens had as he hurried to get out a Christmas book in time - something his publishers deemed would not fly. Of course, everyone knows the outcome, but this story is well done, and the film is very good.The acting is mostly superb throughout ""The Man Who Invented Christmas."" Dan Stevens gives believable life to the character of Dickens. He even looks very much like Dickens from a portrait of the author around that age - 31. Justin Edwards is very good in the role of Dickens's friend, John Forster. Forster was himself a writer, and it was his 1872-74 biography of Charles Dickens that is the best and most authoritative source on Dickens. Moryfdd Clark plays Dickens's wife Kate, and Jonathan Pryce plays Charles's father, John Dickens. Christopher Plummer plays the character of Scrooge in Dickens's daydreams. That and some other small parts lend some humor to the story.There are some small deviations in the script from the real background in Dickens's life. For instance, it implies that he didn't like reporting or journalism work and calls it names. In real life, he was a reporter, general writer and editor of newspapers and magazines. One interesting thing to note is that this film was shot entirely in Ireland. The cast is mostly made up of English and Irish actors, with an occasional Italian or French actor here or there. And, while they aren't mentioned in the movie, the three ""flops"" alluded to, for which Dickens was now in dire straits, would be: ""Nicholas Nickleby"" of 1838-39, ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" of 1840, and ""Barnaby Rudge"" of 1841. Of course, all have been published since then, and none are considered flops.""A Christmas Carol"" must top any serious list of Christmas movies, and there are a number of variations with prominent actors playing the different roles over the ages. This film, about the author and origin of the classic novella, is a very good and most enjoyable story to add to one's Christmas collection. An ideal family situation at yuletide might be to show this film first and then watch the favorite (or two) renditions of ""A Christmas Carol"" movie.Of all the many versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" being made yet well into the 21st century, I don't think any can compare to the best films of the mid-20th century. At the top of my list is the 1951 film that stars Alastair Sim. Close behind that is the 1938 film that stars Reginald Owen and Gene Lockhart. The best TV film made so far, is that of 1984 that stars George C. Scott. And, for those among younger audiences who can't stand black and white films, the 1951 classic with Alastair Sim has a colorized version.But, whatever version or film of the Dickens classic one watches, it's sure to help take the humbug out of the Christmas season as it did in England on that Christmas of the mid-1800s.Here are some favorite lines from this film.Elizabeth Dickens, ""No one is useless in this world..."" Charles Dickens, ""...who lightens the burden of another - I know."" Elizabeth, ""For all his faults, you won't find a kinder man."" Charles, ""Hmmm. How long he is growing up to be one.""Mr. John Dickens, ""We must not disturb the poet when the divine frenzy is upon him.""Charles Dickens, ""Oh, skittle shins to Mrs. Fisk.""Mr. John Dickens, stepping off the train in London, ""Ah! Nothing like the air of the metropolis to put color in your cheeks, eh, mother?""Mr. John Dickens, ""Procrastination is the thief of time, eh Charles?""~SimonJack rated 8/10 on 12 November 2019"," Only one complaint...: (These are only ""spoilers"" if you don't know Dickens' basic biography and/or the impact of Victorian England on what is considered a ""traditional"" Christmas) This review is written in response to a critic who called this film ""highly fictionalized."" As someone who has taught Dickens and specifically ""A Christmas Carol"" for almost 10 years now, I wonder what the critic's problem was? Dickens truly did have a very rough period in his childhood when his father was sent to debtor's prison for living beyond his means and the young boy was forced to work in a boot blacking factory; this experience indelibly affected his outlook on life and his writing, and the movie absolutely captures this. In addition, Dickens was indeed strapped for cash in late 1843 and coming off the flop that was ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" (which he considered his masterpiece) so he did actually punch out the ""Carol"" in an amazing mere 6 weeks as a desperate cash grab. As far as I could tell, the movie was quite accurate, so I don't know what the critic was whining about (maybe he just doesn't know his Dickensian history). Meanwhile, my one complaint...if you're going to call the film ""The Man Who INVENTED Christmas,"" you need to establish how Christmas was (or in this case, really WASN'T) celebrated in England pre-1840s. Aside from the very quick mention by the publishers that ""no one celebrates Christmas anymore"" and a brief reference at the end about a ""tannenbaum"" (aka Christmas tree) and how the German Prince Albert had imported his tradition into his wife Queen Victoria's household, and now everyone will copy the royals, there isn't much mention of how Dickens' work and the period in general affected our concept of Christmas. For example, did you know that 1843 was also the first year printed Christmas cards were sold? And there's a reason little lit up ceramic houses on Christmas display are called ""Dickens villages."" It just seems that the movie could've included more information about the impact on the holiday. Other than that, a very worthy effort which will be worth referencing during my Dickens lessons in the future!~StorieLuver rated 9/10 on 28 November 2017"," It Surprised Me: I was all set to dislike this. The title is so pompous that it's bound to fail. The thing is that there is enough factual biographical material to float the boat. Most of the major events did take place. What makes this work is the incorporation of characters from ""A Christmas Carol"" who play a role in his creative process. Christoper Plummer is excellent as the incarnation of Ebenezer Scrooge. Obviously, these are in the mind of the great writer and portrayed in a corporeal form in the movie. We see Dickens as a flawed man who overspends and over reacts. It is a fun film to look at as eighteenth century England is front and center. It was also neat to see some interesting angles relating to the book.~Hitchcoc rated 9/10 on 5 January 2019"," Wonderful: This is a wonderful film and will be especially delightful for people familiar with ""A Christmas Carol"" and with Dickens in general, but you don't need any background to enjoy it. Basically the film tells the story of how Dickens came to write this classic. The writer's process imagined in this film is true to life for many of us who are writers, though it isn't the only way from pen to paper.Great acting, good sets, and great music with an excellent script help make this a new classic. The only deficit I saw was the less than opulent sets, which is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10.The special gift in this film is seeing Christopher Plummer back on the big screen. Jonathan Price also stands out as Dicken's father.Go see this film. Go see it especially at the Xmas season.~drjgardner rated 9/10 on 3 December 2017"," Inspiring: This was my favorite Christmas movie of 2018. That said, you can watch this movie any time of year because it's not really solely a Christmas movie. It's about Charles Dickens trying to write and get ""A Christmas Carol"" published. So most of the story actually takes place in the fall as he struggles with writers block. It's more an inspiring story about a creative person struggling to accomplish something worthwhile, and because of the elements of the story he's writing, it has Christmas elements now. Save it for Christmas 2019, or watch it now. But just watch it!!!~rolbyh2002 rated 9/10 on 2 January 2019"," An unexpected mix of biopic and fairytale: It actually took me a while to put this movie into a box. Is it a biography about Charles Dickens, or another version of the classic story being told? It's both. It's actually like you watch a theater play that includes special effects you all have to imagine yourself during a play. You can clearly see the theatrical approach that the director wanted to take here. Christopher Plummer is an excellent Scrooge, the perfect fit! Even though this film throws in a good bit of comedy into the pot, it doesn't harm the story at all. If anything, it brings a little bit of freshness to the old classic of ""A Christmas Carol"".I wouldn't describe it as a Christmas movie, or something that the whole family can enjoy for Christmas, but it certainly is a (long needed) new and modern approach to this story and that is still fascinating me, that this story indeed, never gets old.~FilmFlowCritics rated NA on 21 November 2017"," one of the best humbugs: Greetings again from the darkness. Most would agree there is only one Christmas story that surpasses the popularity and familiarity of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", and both have had numerous film and screen adaptations. Rather than offer up yet another film version of the Dickens novella, director Bharat Nalluri (MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY, 2008) instead uses the Susan Coyne screenplay adapted from the non-fiction work of Les Standiford to present the lively and entertaining tale of HOW Dickens wrote his iconic book.Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, 2017) stars as the esteemed writer Charles Dickens, and he bounds from scene to scene like a moody and spoiled Energizer Bunny. Attempts to capture the process behind creative writing usually falls into one of two buckets: dry and boring, or outlandish and over-the-top. Mr. Stevens easily fits into the latter, but as a testament to the strength of the story and supporting cast, we viewers are nonetheless quite entertained. It should surprise no one that Christopher Plummer steals each of his scenes as Ebenezer Scrooge. What a delight to behold the talented octogenarian as he leaves us wishing for even more of the grumpy and miserly old former partner of Jacob Marley. Jonathan Pryce also excels as Charles' father John, a charming man who has never quite figured out the economics of life  and whose long ago debt sent young Charles to a work house mixing shoe black. Even as an adult, Charles had recurring nightmares of his time in child labor, and fortunately he was able to use those memories to create many long-lasting stories, each oblivious to generational change. In 1843 London, the renowned Dickens is coming off three straight flops and experiencing financial woes that are exacerbated by his insistence on the finest materials for the large home he and wife Kate (Morfydd Clark, LOVE & FRIENDSHIP) are renovating. Dickens is in the midst of severe writer's block, and only the quiet strength of his wife and never-wavering loyalty of friend/agent John Forster (Justin Edwards) are able to keep in from sinking to even lower emotional depths. Screen veteran Miriam Margolyes plays the housekeeper, and Anna Murphy is Tara, the Irish nanny who serves as a muse for Dickens.Having the characters of the story appear on screen and interact with the writer is a terrific way to explain how the creative mind works, although at times, the sources of ideas, characters and key lines seem a bit too convenient. We often get the feeling that perhaps too much was crammed into the run time, what with the conflicts over money, renovations, family matters, and publishing. The best parts are also the easiest with which to relate – those involving the characters and the story slowly coming together.Simon Callow plays John Leech, the famed illustrator of the finished novella, and Miles Jupp adds a bit of twisted fun as Dickens' rival William Makepeace Thackery. There are some interesting lines that add color, such as, ""People will believe anything if you are properly dressed"", and ""blood of iron, heart of ice"". It's these pieces that allow us to view this as a journey of self-discovery for the author, and not just a famous story being assembled. The overall trouble with the film stems from that title. It seems we could have expected more than a tease of what Christmas was at the time, and more specifically how ""A Christmas Carol"" inspired a revolutionary new approach to the holiday. We are left to connect many dots. In fact, Dickens didn't so much invent Christmas as allow folks to re- imagine it.Is ""A Christmas Carol"" the most famous Dickens story? Arguments could also be made for ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"", ""Little Dorrit"", ""Nicholas Nickelby"", and of course, ""A Tale of Two Cities"". What can't be argued is the brilliance of the writer and the impact of his books. His passion is evident in his determination to self- publish at a time when such practice was a rare as it is commonplace today. The film is rated PG, but younger kids are likely to be confused with the frenetic approach; however, all ages will get a merry kick out of Mr. Plummer's Scrooge!~ferguson-6 rated 6/10 on 22 November 2017"," Delightful, Imaginative, Dramatic, and Entertaining: 5 December 2017. This whimsical family period drama about Charles Dickens' experience in writing and in getting his Christmas classic, ""A Christmas Carol"" published offers up a delightful and penetrating movie tapping into the special nature of film. Using creative imagination, artistry, and some fascinating stylized characters, the movie's director and screenplay writer have brought to the screen a wonderful film that both tantalizes with its whimsy and penetrates with its emotional dramatic scenes that even enhance A Christmas Carol story itself. Unlike the trailers for this movie, the movie tends towards more of a dramatic tone with tender sad moments, flaring outbursts of emotional anger, redemption, all the while interspersed with imagining of the creative process of Mr. Dickens. Like A Christmas Carol itself, this movie presents a hidden side of Charles Dickens and nineteenth century Britain in a revealing and meaningful way. This move is a wonderful way to spend some reflective and enjoyable moments at the theater during these Holidays.~tabuno rated 8/10 on 8 January 2019"," ""No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of another."": The film is an entertaining reimagining of the origins of the celebrated story, ""A Christmas Carol"". The real Charles Dickens wasn't as handsome as the actor portraying him here, but the locations and costuming for this Victorian Era tale are superb, and there's a sense of fun with the story, especially if one is versed in the characters, dialog and situations of Dickens' classic work. Perspective on Dickens' (Dan Stevens) early life are woven into the story via a series of flashbacks, as the story opens with a view of the author touring New York City in 1842, fresh off the unprecedented success of ""Oliver Twist"". But as the following months go by, a serious writer's block creates a dry spell. With his financial resources dwindling, he's forced to make a quick decision on his next work, and veers into a Christmas story by chance, influenced by unexpected encounters with people he meets that inspire some of the characters that will form the basis of his story. One doesn't think about early writers as having literary agents, but Dickens does respond to the prodding and suggestions of his man Forster (Justin Edwards), who helps guide him through some rough patches both emotionally and financially. The result, as the closing frame tells us, was a story that took a whirlwind six weeks to write, published a mere five days before Christmas Eve in 1843, and wound up being a popular sell out in less than a week. Though the movie itself may not wind up as popular as those actually based on ""A Christmas Carol"", it does offer an interesting insight into Dickens' creative mind. For those with the misfortune of never having seen any of the movie versions, allow me to recommend my favorite of them all, that being the 1951 classic starring Alastair Sim in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, although most of the alternatives aren't too bad as well.~classicsoncall rated 8/10 on 12 December 2018"," Dan Stevens and Christopher Plummer head wonderful cast: When Dan Stevens asked that Matthew, his ""Downton Abbey"" character, be ""killed off"" so he could pursue other acting opportunities, I thought his career would go directly downhill. Matthew Crawley was a pleasant young man - but really didn't give Stevens much meat to chew so I figured his career would go the unsuccessful way of many other actors of limited talent who left successful TV parts. However, he was right to leave. He is much more talented than Matthew Crawley allowed him to be. His versatility is showcased to perfection as Charles Dickens in THE MAN WHO INVENTED Christmas.It doesn't hurt that his Dickens is surrounded by a charming group of eccentrics, some of whom exist in his 19th century reality and others of whom exist only in his fertile imagination. I particularly liked Anna Murphy's Tara, the Irish housemaid who presents Dickens with inspiration for several key elements in his ""A Christmas Carol."" Ms. Murphy's career should advance as she has a quite likable screen persona and an ability to stand out in any scene.Christopher Plummer is wonderful in every part in which he plays. What woman wouldn't want to heal the heart of his Captain Von Trappe (THE SOUND OF MUSIC)? Who wouldn't want to hear his Chang declaim Shakespeare in its original Klingon(STAR TREK VI)? And who couldn't be caught up in the soul of Hal in his Academy Award winning BEGINNERS? I saw him in his stage presentation of BARRYMORE and was mesmerized. His Scrooge is equally mesmerizing.The script is tight, the acting is solid, the sets, costumes, and staging are perfectly 1843. This movie should become a true Christmas classic - just as ""A Christmas Carol"" itself is a classic. In short - I loved it!~gwmbkm rated 10/10 on 26 November 2017"
