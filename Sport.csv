You might actually extend that dubious distinction to just about any family anywhere. Patriarch Fritz Von Erich (real name John 'Jack' Adkisson) was a big-name star during the Fifties and Sixties, feared for his famous signature finishing move, 'The Iron Claw'. Five of his sons followed his footsteps into a wrestling career with varying degrees of success, or lack thereof. The only one left alive is Kevin, who at a young age, was never explained the death of his six-year-old brother Jackie, the first of the Von Erich children to die an unnatural death by electric shock and drowning.This movie was a whole lot better than I expected it to be. Personally, I lost interest in professional wrestling around the mid-1980's, just around the time the older Von Erichs were making their mark in the field. I knew father Fritz Von Erich to be a dangerous competitor during his era of the Fifties and Sixties, and when in the movie, he complains of not getting the recognition he needed to be elevated to World Heavyweight Champion, one might consider it was his grating personality as an aggressive self-promoter that stood in the way. Holt McCallany was a good choice for Fritz, who he resembled quite closely.Having not followed the entertainment sport for almost forty years now, the chronology of events in this movie challenged me at times, but it was all there. Except for one nagging omission, that being one Von Erich brother missing from the narrative. For the sake of keeping the story constrained within a budget, director Sean Durkin opted to make Mike Von Erich (Stanley Simons) a composite figure of his real-life counterpart and yet another brother, Chris. Had Chris been included, the emotional overload would have been even more grueling, as Chris also committed suicide by gunshot two years before Kerry, portrayed by Jeremy Allen White. Following Chris's suicide, Fritz and Doris Von Erich (Maura Tierney) divorced after three months, an event omitted from the story.Befitting the family's tragic history, the movie's final scene with Kevin (Zac Efron) hugging his two young sons and sorrowfully stating that he's no longer a brother is enough to bring a tear to one's eye. A closing frame of Kevin's present day family of four children and thirteen grandchildren doesn't offer the fact that his two sons, Kevin and David, are currently professional wrestlers themselves. One would certainly hope that the curse of the Von Erichs doesn't extend to the present generation.P. S. - If you would like to go directly to the source, look up the first season episode of ""Dark Side of the Ring: The Last of the Von Erichs"". In it, Kevin Von Erich takes the viewer through the circumstances surrounding the death of each of his brothers. Be prepared for the present-day Kevin, the episode was filmed in 2019. He's a gaunt and almost frail looking individual with a subdued and composed manner when speaking about his father and brothers.~classicsoncall rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," One of the Best Films of 2023. Zac Efron, Best Actor in a Generational Performance. Equal Parts 20th Century American Success Story and Timeless American Tragedy: This is one of the greatest wrestling movies ever made. Certainly the greatest true wrestling story ever made.This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made.But you need to know nothing about wrestling nor of this famous wrestling family to absorb the absolute impact that this movie will have on you inside the theater.This carries the same weight, pound for pound, as the fabulous Elvis movie did a year or so ago.This movie also magnificently captures that wonderful and amazing era of life before the internet and social media.Where real feats of strength, endurance and physical athleticism had to be either witnessed in person and seen with one's own eyes, or on some small screen somewhere.Legends were made inside a ring in tiny arenas and gymnasiums on this country's soil. And their images were then plastered on paper in magazines that covered the racks at the local drug store or grocery store.And it was every bit as influential as anything that one could possibly find on their phones today.This is an unbelievable and incredible tale.Everyone should know the Von Erichs.They will after seeing this.~RightOnDaddio rated 9/10 on 22 December 2023"," Heartbreaking Cursed Family: The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.~statuskuo rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"," An emotionally haunting film: The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy. I found myself heartbroken by the tragedies portrayed on screen, yet incredibly moved by the brotherhood these characters shared. Hold your loved ones close!~parksiet rated 8/10 on 24 December 2023"," Whether you're a fan of Pro wrestling or not, you'll love this sad, but amazing film: Let me preface this by saying I am not a fan of pro wrestling at all. I actually think it's kind of silly but this film is great regardlessAs always A24 delivers another great film. The acting is amazing. The story and dialogue are great. Everything about this film is awesome. It is a bit sad though. But coming in, I knew it was gonna be sad because I knew a little bit about the Von Erics from my dad who loves pro wrestling.Zac Efron does an amazing job as the lead in this film. The co stars that played his family do a great job as well. Zac Efron and pretty much every major character has an amazing arc and a lot of development. They also have very good chemistry on screen.Story wise it is a very good story, but very sad at the same time. It does have the benefit of being based off of a truly amazing story of a family of athletes. The dialogue is very well written. The story goes very smoothly.The production value was good. I've come to expect a good production value when it comes to A24 films. The cinematography isn't as crazy or unique as a normal A24 film but they still do a good job regardless.Overall, it's worth the time and money you spend.~lopresti-46927 rated 8/10 on 22 December 2023"," Great exploration of the Von Erich family: I am not a wrestling fan but this was great!It's an interesting character study of a movie about the Von Erich family with strong direction from Sean Durkin, an interesting narrative with great themes and emotions, and great performances from all the cast members. I am not very familiar with the Von Erich backstory but the movie does a pretty good job on examining the characters and setting with strong directing from Durkin which helped bring the atmosphere and setting to the heights. The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times. Alongside with the dialogue as well. There are some certain soundtrack choices that were a bit odd and there are some pacing moments that could have improved. I wouldn't this is my all time favorite A24 flick but it's another good one!~chenp-54708 rated 7/10 on 22 December 2023"," Larger than life...: I knew that this was based on a true story and I'd watched one trailer before going into it. Aside from that, I went into this movie completely blind; I'm not a wrestling fan and I didn't research anything about the Von Erichs before seeing this.This film is so tragic that I found myself astounded by the fact that it was based on a true story. It feels like something out of a Greek tragedy or Stephen King novel. Unfortunately, it's neither: this is the story of an obsessive and unfeeling man who forced his failed dreams onto each of his sons ... and the catastrophes it caused...Everyone who talks about ""The Iron Claw"" is going to rave about how great of a job Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White are in this (and don't get me wrong, they're PHENOMENAL), but I was especially blown away by Harris Dickinson's portrayal of David Von Erich; he carried every scene he was in with a larger-than-life, yet supportive persona.""The Iron Claw"" is more than good enough to earn a couple of Oscar nominations next year ... but based on the recently released shortlist and strong competition, I doubt it's going to make it.Regardless, I still recommend this unbelievable and emotional movie. I hope I'll get the chance to see it again before it leave theaters...~robin196 rated 10/10 on 22 December 2023"," Solid 10: I cannot begin to describe how accurate Zac's portrayal of Kevin is. I knew the brothers in the early 80's. This is a heart wrenching account that delivers every high and low of their lives.The performances are nuanced, with an unexpected depth. This is not a feel good movie. The ending is actually the beginning and that is beautiful. Lily James is stupendous and mesmerizing as Pam, and I simply cannot express my awe of Zac's performance. He deserves an Oscar.Just know that this story is as close to a documentary as it can possibly be. It was beautiful seeing the actual footage from various match ups. Thank you for making this.~austinbeyondcompare rated 10/10 on 23 December 2023"," I'll never be okay: Maybe the saddest film ever made. Complete & hopeless tragedy that has palpable oppression.

I thought this would be a typical sports movie centered around wrestling. Fortunately, this film was more than that. It touched on many topics like brotherhood, father son dynamics and grief. This film was way more tragic than anything I could have thought of and what makes it crazy is that it's all true.The acting was very good in this film and all the relationships were believable except for how quickly Kevin and Pam got together.All of the actors playing the brothers had great chemistry. The motives and decisions of all the characters were well executed. The wrestling scenes were well done even though this film was less about wrestling and more about the family.While I enjoyed this film, I did feel that it could have been longer. Some of the events felt rushed and crammed together. More major wrestling events should have been added to show some of the wrestling politics. The wives in the film played very minimal roles in the film and it was hard to believe that they weren't more involved in real life.With that said this was still a gripping and memorable film that deserves to be watched.~moviemanmo rated 8/10 on 23 December 2023"
The Boys in the Boat (2023) - IMDb,7.3,Joel Edgerton|Callum Turner|Peter Guinness|Sam Strike|Thomas Elms|Jack Mulhern|Luke Slattery|Bruce Herbelin-Earle|Wil Coban|Tom Varey|Joel Phillimore|James Wolk|Hadley Robinson|Courtney Henggeler|Chris Diamantopoulos|Glenn Wrage|Edward Baker-Duly|Adrian Lukis,George Clooney,Daniel James Brown|Mark L. Smith,"A 1930s-set story centered on the University of Washington's rowing team, from their Depression-era beginnings to winning gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics."," Wonderful motion picture, but do read the book!: We waited so long for this movie to be made, ever since Daniel James Brown wrote the story. A serendipitous set of events led to the story even being recorded, as Judy Rantz Willman just happened to have Daniel James Brown as a neighbor, and eventually persuaded Brown to visit her father, who was in hospice care. What he thought was a social visit, she saw as a book about to be written. His initial skepticism evaporated quickly, when Joe began sharing his story. In Joe's remaining couple of months of life, Brown met with Rantz several times to begin creating the outline for the book. He then met with the families of the other crew members, followed by two years of further research, aided by Judy Rantz. The eight were amazing people, accustomed to hardship and personal challenges. For example, when Don Hume's family moved from Anacortes to Olympia, Don tossed his belongings into a rowboat and paddled down Puget Sound to his new home, roughly 100 miles away. Look at a map! A multiple-sport letterman in high school, he had also placed third in a state pianist's competition. And Joe Rantz was such a standout athlete in gymnastics at Roosevelt High School, that Coach Ulbrickson already had his eye on him then. So, what did we miss in the movie? Joe's difficult pre-college life is mostly absent, and worth the read by itself. We also miss Joe's wanderings around Berlin, where he witnesses Germany's horrific treatment of its Jewish population, under its totalitarian leader. Like nearly everything from Hollywood, a bit of romance is thrown in to add spice, but the story shines, throughout the picture. Here and there a bit of drama is added for effect, but personalities presented by the actors conform closely with who they represented. George Pocock really was the sage he seemed in the movie. Don Hume comes across as a bit socially awkward in the movie. A good friend met him several years ago where she worked, and described him as, uh, gruff. The fearless audacity of the team comes through in a story told only in the book. Before sailing to Germany for the Olympics, the team decides to drop in, unannounced, on Franklin Roosevelt at his home. Although they didn't find the president at home, they did spend the evening there. The story behind this movie is too remarkably wonderful to be fiction. See the movie, but by all means read the book!~rob-87379 rated 9/10 on 25 December 2023"," Great story, but poor direction / writing: The story is incredible, so I was surprised how flat the movie was. Yes, you get some feel-good moments, but there were so many missed opportunities to make this a truly great movie. The narrative leaves a lot of loose ends that prevent us from connecting with the characters. The actors did their best with what was given, but I really wanted to know more about each character. There were also some shockingly cheesy elements - the intro and ending were completely superfluous, and just lame. The music score was corny and dated. The Boys in the Boat is worth watching once, but if you want the real story, read the book.~gaigeredd rated 6/10 on 28 December 2023"," Predictably uplifting: ... Merrily, merrily, merrily,Life is but a dream ...A huge bestseller when it was published in 2013, Daniel James Brown's ""The Boys in the Boat"" was a big hit in my circle of friends. The kind of book that gets recommended, if not passed around, pal to pal.Set in the '30s it was the true story of the University of Washington junior varsity rowing team who not only gunned down the storied, legacy crews of California and Ivy League colleges, but went on to the 1936 Olympics in Adolf Hitler's Berlin. It was an adrenalized page turner, a movie waiting to happen.Now that it's getting to the screen, it helps to have George Clooney in the director's chair. Although he stays offscreen, the double-Oscar-winning actor, producer and director is the biggest name on the project.It's his face - generally recognized as one of the coolest guys on the planet - in many of the production stills and the ""for your consideration"" ads targeted at industry voters this awards season. George and co-producer Grant Heslov also took part in a recent Zoom press conference for the film along with cast members Joel Edgerton, who stars as taciturn coach Al Ulbrickson; Callum Turner, who plays team member Joe Rantz; and Hadley Robinson, who lights up the screen as Joe's sweetheart, Joyce.Opening in theaters Christmas Day, it's a feel-good throwback to old-fashioned moviemaking.Taking place during the Great Depression, the scrappy kids at their oars offered glimpses of optimism and hope, rare commodities in those tough times. Rowing was a popular spectator sport in that pre-ESPN era with spectators lining river banks and in some cases following the action in train cars on the shore keeping pace with the sleek 8-man wooden shells slicing through the water.Not just an incredibly demanding sport, rowing was a culture, too. The rowing world was made of wood - not just the glossy racing shells, but also their big-doored, high-ceilinged boat houses. You can almost smell the resins and varnish coming from the boathouse surrounded by lush forest on the Seattle campus.As the team keeps achieving more success, the gorgeous historically recreated settings move, first to colleges on the East Coast before heading for swastika-adorned Germany. Legendary speedster Jesse Owens was another member of the U. S. Olympic team that year. During the press conference Clooney acknowledged borrowing camera angles from Hitler's propagandist Leni Riefenstahl for the climactic Olympic rowing scenes.""We like to use Nazis whenever we can for filming,"" he joked.The mood was light during the Zoom press conference, now that the film was in the can and the cast's arduous training was long past.London-born actor Turner, whose Joe Rantz is as close as the eight-man team can get to having a hero, acknowledged that he hadn't had any previous rowing experience.""None of us had actually. And we turn up in February, and we get on the river. And it's snowing. And we're all in the tight shorts and freezing cold and have no skill at being in the boat. And after about three weeks, George and Grant come down to have a look and check in on us. We weren't in a good place. And I could see the pain behind the smile on George's face.""""That wasn't pain. That was fear,"" corrected Heslov.The boys on the real team hadn't had any experience, either. For Joe and several teammates, making the team - beating the scores of hopefuls for the eight seats (plus the coxswain) - meant getting room and board at the university.Unlike Ivy Leaguers born to the sport, the junior Huskies were rough hewn. ""They were lumberjacks,"" said Clooney. They came together as a team ""out of necessity, out of hunger, out of having nothing else.""The actors trained together for five months. Unlike their competitors in the film in new fiberglass shells, their boat, the Huskie Clipper, was made of wood like the original. Beyond just acting, there was a sense of athletic accomplishment for Turner and his teammates.""The hardest part about rowing is that you all have to be in complete unison,"" said the actor. ""There's no, like, hiding. And if one person is out by a millimeter, the boat suffers.""For his part, Clooney faced a different set of challenges.""The oars are, you know, 15 feet long. And then the boats are 40-some feet long. So, you can't get close to the boats with the camera. And you can't get side by side or ahead of the boats with your camera boat, 'cause you'll capsize the boat. So, we had to come up with a design to get in tight enough to make it exciting. Meaning, we're on an 80-foot arm on the boat with a 300-millimeter lens, 200-millimeter lens, down low, getting wet, trying to hold focus while you're doing that. So, there was a ton of, like, math to try to make those things exciting.""On top of that, neither Joe Rantz or Coach Ulbrickson were especially loquacious. They were men of action rather than words. On the printed page this is no big deal. On the big screen it can be. Hadley Robinson's feistiness along with her beauty, and Courtney Henggeler's portrayal of the coach's wife, Hazel, go a long way to humanizing their male partners.In a key scene, Joe and Joyce share what Clooney called ""a 1940s movie kiss"" - in a train station, no less. In a way, ""The Boys in the Boat"" itself is a 1940s movie. It's beautiful to look at, it wears its heart on its sleeve. It comes from an era when wholesome was cool. Standing up and cheering was nothing to be embarrassed by.But the psychological reserve of its characters played better on the page than they do on the screen.Despite Clooney's assured direction and the unbreakable spirit of the cast, neither the predictable script nor the soft sentiments of Alexandre Desplat musical score produce the irrepressible ""Chariots of Fire"" sorts of emotions that spell the difference between good sports movies and great ones.~rickchatenever rated 7/10 on 25 December 2023"," The Cultural Significance of Sports in America: Clooney hits the mark beautifully with this film. This is a story about a ragtag group of boys who come together to unify a nation despite the circumstances around it. A story that hard work will beat talent when talent fails to work hard. This movie didn't have the marketing of Aquaman or Wonka but the story is compelling and well told. Edgerton is great, as is the rest of cast. This movie will get you on your feet and make you feel proud to be an American (if you are one). To me, this movie illustrates, similar to Miracle, Remember the Titans or Rocky (albeit fictional) that nothing is more culturally significant to Americans than sports. Consider watching it yourself if you're down for a feel good movie.~qdmqvq rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," The story of US!: The story was enough. It showed what we are capable of when we are hungry and determined. No excuses, no quitting-do your best and that is usually enough. The actors were believable and worked hard to be able to be on the boat-no faking it. Loved the camera work, showing perfectly the race from above. Great job!Our country has been through extreme difficult times. The depiction of The Great Depression proves to us how the spirit of unity and relentless work can help us overcome any situation. We need this spirit today, more than ever, as our country faces division and contempt for those that disagree with our position. The American eagle, our symbol of grace and strength, inspires me. That beautiful bird must have a right and a left wing to fly. Let's protect and respect our diversity and freedom of opinion, today and always.~marialucgom rated 8/10 on 26 December 2023"," Hands down favorite movie of 2023!: What an amazing movie!I actually forgot that I was in the movie theater and found myself clapping and cheering with each race!The entire ensemble was perfectly cast! I must say, I can't pick a favorite character or actor, each one held their own with an outstanding performance.Though based in Seattle, this movie is not just for the Husky alumni to enjoy. I was incredibly moved by Cal's role in the non-fiction story.Everyone worked together to make America extremely proud during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany.Definitely watch and support this movie. It's absolutely worth the price of a ticket and popcorn; you'll definitely want to watch this one at the theater.~tabathastewart rated 10/10 on 25 December 2023"," Time To Row This Boat Ashore To The Nearest Theater: Likes:Pace-It's a movie about racing boats via rowing, and it could be awesome, or it could be boring, depending on how many elements they try to explore.-Boys in the Boat turns out to be the entertaining pace for me, a beautiful mashup of character development Disney elements, with the pace of an Olympic event.-It lays out the grounds, puts the stakes at hand, and then hits water skimming to keep the stone going until it reaches the other side.-A startling balance, I really had little time to be bored when the movie just kept my attention in these boys' journey, and how good it felt to go on the ride.Humor-The Humor may not be the most knee slapping or bust a gut moment I've seen, but it holds instead something else I appreciate.-Balance. Clooney and his team wrote a great movie that integrates laughs into the mix, but not to the point of breaking character or going too far out of the way.-More about the execution, this movie accomplished much with just being real people and finding the right moment to throw a comedy punch that hit hard.Acting-Another fine community coming together to craft a world, there were few people in this movie that felt fake or too forced for a performance.-Guinness was a fantastic mentor role, wise, cunning, but still approachable, holding a look and delivery that just needed more time to simmer than we got. I really enjoyed his chemistry with two of the actors and felt he was one of the most cinematic moments of the movie.-Turner's performance it fantastic, a wonderful blend of that heartthrob story, with a touch of O. C. meeting the Remember The Titans presentation. A fantastic blend, he helps really anchor the story, brining love, honor, and struggles to the mix to help go along the lines of the racing. By far the character with the most investment, he had a lot on his shoulders to make it believable.-And Edgerton continues to take those harder roles and sell them with that panache he has brought many times. Calm, collected, but motivational, he has some of the more monumental quotes of the movie and he make it look darn good too.Settings/Recreation-Going back into the 1930s, you have to have the look and fell, and Hollywood continues to have those resources to make the past the present.-Fantastic buildings and schools hold that old world charm, window apparel, the cars, and the accessories all culminating in the look of the house and business at the time.Not enough? The movie flourishes in flaunting the times of the old with how they advertised the event, using radio, newspaper, and the occasional theater preview to further immerse one into the mix.-Add in the clothes and the use of the old-time music machines with the Big Band numbers, and you accomplish much to bring you back to the past and enrich the experience even further.Cinematography-Beautiful coordination by the camera team brough to life this story and helped add that immersion experience to my viewing.-Nothing stupendous in regards to most of the non-boating moments, we had stable work, dynamic angles, and just the right shot to get the moment.-Once the boat races start up though, that was the best camera work of the bunch, the ingraining of every possible shot imaginable edited together in beautiful collaboration.-On the boat, the rowers, the competition, and the crowd, all blended into each race to help build up the momentum and unleash that spectacle that feels both real and Hollywood magic.-I loved seeing the sides, feeling the integration of America and help bring that emotional aspect to the full brim.The Hope-I think something this movie did, that many others have failed to do, is just how motivated I was at the end.-Not to row, but to push hard and discipline myself to handle the problems that face me. Boys in the Boat is that feel good movie, that doesn't have to preach or go too hard to get the message across.-I loved the way the training felt difficult, but natural, alongside seeing just what these small victories brought to the country.-Seeing development of the characters and situations without being bombarded by political lines and out of the way antics to highlight only further impressed me with how Clooney made a good movie.-Sure, it's a tad cliché at times, but props to once again a victory in taking that emotional gamble. Wow.The Boat Races-And all of this comes in those boat races that incorporate so much to really feel worth the investment.-Fantastic pacing and that quick sensation are the start, providing a foundation that feels very much like ng event.-Then you take all those tricks of camera, a dynamic, fast-paced change up edited together to make the event even more engaging, incorporating so many elements to help ensnare you into the moment.-Add the music with the commentary, and the movie just manages to make some of the best sporting shots I've seen in a long while, really making these moments the climactic elements they wanted it to be.DISLIKES:More Time With Characters-Despite all the good though, a lot of the rowers are going to be forgettable, because they don't really get much time to shine in the movie.-Some characters have their unique qualities, but many are kind of just feeling like extras, there to row, and nothing more, which given how ""united"" they were... sort of ironic in this flaw.-Obviously they can't do what they did for the main characters for 7 guys and keep it within reasonable time, but Remember the Titans shows how to balance other characters better than this film. So that would have been nice.A Tad Rushed At Parts-Other moments feel very rushed, the family life of the coach, the struggles with the rower's living situation, even the recruitment all feel a bit blunt and lacking the finesse.-Throw in the buildup to the races in the Olympics even felt very back-to-back. Not sure if that happened in real life, but I really felt that some of the montages just felt a bit fast forwarded in their presentation. Oh well, they at least optimized the exciting times and made good use of the cuts.Predictable-If you know the story and heard the trailers, you lose some of the edge of this movie.-It's exciting to see the journey, but with the knowledge about what happens with this team, you can be assured that the spark is missing a bit in terms of what will happen.-Fortunately, the presentation is so on point that it overtakes and minimize the predictable factor, and as most people in my audience showed, a lot of clapping still came out with this movie.The VERDICT:The Boys In the Boat is by far one of the better sports movies to grace the theaters in a very long time. Like Remember The Titans, the movie knows how to really inspire without becoming too cheesy, and knows how to cover a lot of plots in a small amount of time. Clooney directed his cast well, all teams helping to bring us back in time, integrate fantastic settings, and bring about that slice of history that you need for a movie like this. Throw in talented actors to craft the team to deliver some well-crafted dialogue and you only further help match the feeling I got with Disney era films from the past. Yet it's the boating scenes that make this movie theater worthy, so many elements teased and combined to unleash the most epic moments for me this holiday season. These scenes are not only fun and engaging to watch, but inspire the message of hope and motivation they promised in the trailers. Sure, there were a lot of things to balance and improve on, but the spectacle is enough to help weather the storm and buffer some of these dislikes.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Sport: 8.5Movie Overall: 7.5.~rgkarim rated 9/10 on 27 December 2023"," Great 2 hours: I loved book, I saw the PBS documentary, but was sorry to see early poor reviews for this film. Saw a promo on tv that it was opening on Christmas Day, and snagged a seat, but I had very little expectation that it would be good. Boy, was I wrong! This film held my attention fully, and given the terrible nature of our society right now, it was a total breath of fresh air to be transported to another time and place. Not since Indiana Jones have I felt so fully ensconced in The Great Depression, by the beautiful cinematography, perfect costuming, and fine acting depicting the sheer difficulty of just surviving in the US then. I understand some poignant issues for Joe Rantz needed to be removed from the movie due to time constraints, but all are easily accessible to anyone wanting more information. In short, I have a newfound respect for George Clooney, who made a very fine film.~sharonbach rated 8/10 on 27 December 2023"," olympic inspiration: Greetings again from the darkness. It's always disappointing when a book is so interesting and enjoyable to read, only to be followed up by a movie version that doesn't live up to the source material. My son recommended the 2013 best-selling non-fiction novel from Daniel James Brown, and it was truly fascinating to read such an inspirational story around the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Of course, we all know the Jesse Owens story, yet somehow the remarkable and unlikely tale of the University of Washington crew team never received the publicity it earned. Director George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, 2015) and screenwriter Mark L Smith (THE REVENANT, 2015) have attempted to reach a wider audience by adapting Brown's book for the big screen.The story begins in Seattle during the Great Depression. Engineering student Joe Rantz (an excellent Callum Turner, EMMA., 2020) is behind on his tuition and has had no luck securing work. We learn Joe has been on his own for years, and has remained focused on his education despite living in such poverty that he frequently goes without meals and uses folded newspapers to keep dirt and moisture out of the hole in his shoe sole. His buddy Roger (Sam Strike) informs him of crew tryouts, and a spot on the JV team comes with a job and stipend. No-nonsense coach Al Ulbrickson (Joel Edgerton) isn't much for motivational speeches and lets the rookies know most won't survive the training to claim one of the eight seats on the boat.Contradictory arguments can be made that director Clooney either took on too much of the story, or not enough. The result is a middling movie about an incredibly inspirational story of underdogs reaching the highest levels of achievement. Included here are only brief glimpses of the personal life of Coach Ulbrickson and his pertinent past, the motivation and wisdom of boat maker George Pocock (screen vet Peter Guiness), and the blossoming romance between Joe and Joyce (up and coming Hadley Robinson, LITTLE WOMEN, 2019). However, the biggest gap here is the connection and camaraderie between Joe and his teammates. The importance of working together ""as one"" is preached, but we aren't privy to how this happened so quickly. Skimming over this is the film's major flaw, as that bond is the key to their growth and success. By the end of the film, most will only recall Joe's name and two or three other faces on the team.The racing scenes on the water were surely challenging to film, and come across as realistic, even though we know these are actors and not world class athletes. The rich versus poor element is touched on, as are the politics which, yes, even existed in sports 90 years ago. Initially it's the newcomers against legendary coach Ky Ebright (Glenn Wrage) and his favored team from Cal, and then it becomes the blue-collar Washington boys against the Ivy League elites ... before heading to Berlin. The Olympics give us swastikas, a cheesy meet between the boys and Jessie Owens, and Daniel Philpott reprising his portrayal as Hitler from ""The Crown"", only with more outlandish mannerisms.The radio broadcasts provide a nostalgic look of how challenging it was to keep up with things during the era, and the newsreels are another nice touch. For those who have never been part of a crew, the term coxswain is likely a new one, and Clooney includes actual photos of the team over the closing credits. The memorable quote is ""We were never eight, we were one"", but for some reason director Clooney thought it a good idea to have a lame framing device set in more modern times around this historic tale. Somehow, we don't feel the adrenaline rush we should during this movie as it falls short of Oscar winner CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981), perhaps the film that Clooney was attempting to mimic.Opening in theaters nationwide on December 25, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 6/10 on 26 December 2023"," Solid Christmas Time Family Sports Uplifter: It seems to have been a very long time since we had a sports movie where it's purely about the sport and the drive to excel to the highest level. Not that movies that add social commentary are poor or unnecessary, but sometimes it's nice to just have a movie where you can sit on the edge of your seat and watch the main characters work as hard as they can to try and achieve their dreams. If you can ignore some of its faults it is an excellent choice for the entire family to enjoy.As for some of its leading issues in my view: A lot of the characters and scenes are poorly developed or not connected properly. For example, we don't really see the boys characters develop a bond outside of a couple parties.The relationship with Joe and his girlfriend has an awkwardness to it and never receives a proper conclusion due to wasting screen time elsewhere.We have the inclusion of some scenes that are included that don't really naturally slide into the story or could be eliminated in favor of other needed elements to develop the characters more.The film also lacks a really outstanding performance. The film must have lacked a bit of a budget. An actor like Tom Hanks as the coach could have elevated it a lot more. Lastly another annoying part was a couple of the tacky scenes included. I'm not sure they even needed Hitler for the movie to work, and most definitely if they were going to include him could have put a bit more into the costume and appearance. I've watched a lot of shows and movies with fake Hitler actors and the one in this movie is without a doubt the worst.But again, if you don't knit pick and want something where you can just enjoy an uplifting film this is a great pick. It's a very difficult movie to dislike. Made for an enjoyable family Boxing Day.~ThereelscoopwithKK rated 7/10 on 27 December 2023"

There's also some wonderful location work too, they really did make use of several world-wide locations.Archie Madekwe does a great job as Jann, he puts in an excellent performance, you really do see the young man develop and grow through the film. Always good to see Bloom, and he played the part well, David Harbour was excellent I thought, he added a lot to the overall story.Is this the most random soundtrack ever, I never thought Kenny G, Black Sabbath and Enya would feature together in the same cinema, let alone the same movie.I never thought I'd welling up over a bluebird, but there you have it, there were one of two very touching scenes.Hard to imagine it's based on a true story, but credit where it's due, it translated into a fine movie.7/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 7/10 on 9 August 2023"," Saw this in 4DX, blown away!: I'm not a gamer, I have an old version of GT kicking around I may have played last 5+ years ago, but no matter, what an incredible true story this was! I had no clue this actual story happened, and as far as true-events films go, this is right up there with the best. It's a true underdog inspirational story that was cast perfectly, and filmed just as great, with stunning effects, visuals and camera work. The pacing and story-flow was just right, in that the 134 min runtime flew by quickly. Watching it in a 4DX theatre added to the experience for sure. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. Now I just may have to go find that old GT game and throw it in and go for a spin.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 27 August 2023"," Knowledge of the game is a plus, but this is not a video game movie.: Here's The 4K Lowedown on the advanced screening of ""Gran Turismo"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)Release date: August 11, 2023Genre: Drama/SportMy Score: 8.4Cast=6 Acting=8 Plot=9 Ending=10 Story=8Interest=9 Script=8 Cinema=9 Sport=7 Triumph=10A struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.""If you miss a line in the game, you reset...you miss it on the track, you could die."" I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. I think you have to at least have knowledge of the game to appreciate the cinematography, but this is not a video game movie. It checked all the boxes for me with the action, racing, and the triumph over adversity. This is definitely worth a watch and was a good change of pace after watching Oppenheimer.~lojitsu rated 8/10 on 25 July 2023"," I expected little and was blown away!: I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, except that it was based on a video racing game. To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation.With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport.The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy.Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a cliché because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived.The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless.The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily. How did this have so little buzz and anticipation before it was released?~andydavis-19959 rated 9/10 on 30 September 2023"," The video game movie streak continues!: I watched Gran Turismo early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. For some perspective, I've never watched professional racing or played Gran Turismo. And I'm generally not a fan of based-on-true-story against-all-odds movies. They're usually all the same.The reason I say all this is to illustrate that the movie had to be really good to win me over. And it definitely does. Even though it goes through many of the same motions as these types of movies, it does it all so well. I was fully invested in the story, the characters and their outcomes. My crowd was really into it as well.I can't speak to how the movie translates the game, but they creatively incorporate some cool visuals. It helps it feel like a video game movie as opposed to a movie about a video game. The race scenes are awesome, you really feel like you're there. I like the cast, with the two leads being the obvious standouts. And there are some really heartfelt moments.I had a great time with Gran Turismo. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a premium screen (IMAX, Dolby Atmos, etc). I think most people will like it, gamer or not, race fan or not, old, young, etc.(1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 7/24/2023)As a side note, I'm really hoping we've turned a corner with video game movies, similar to what happened to super hero movies in the early 2000's. I really enjoyed Sonic 1 and 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in contention for my favorite movie of the year.There is still so much potential. If they continue down the super hero path, then someone like Christopher Nolan will take a property and show what can truly be done. My dream would be for Metroid to be the Dark Knight trilogy of video game movies.~FeastMode rated 7/10 on 25 July 2023"," An underdog story full of momentum: Gran Turismo is a terrifically executed sports movie, fizzing with energy and momentum from start to finish.It follows the story of Jann Mardenborough, a gamer who always dreamed of becoming a professional racer. Thanks to the Gran Turismo academy he suddenly finds himself with a chance to make his dream a reality. It's a wild story and the fact that it is based on real events is astounding.Even though the real events are unbelievable, the story beats are all pretty familiar and follow the usual sports movie formula. There's the underdog, the jaded mentor, the belligerent rival, the customary montage. None of this is ground breaking but it is all well presented and packaged up. The fact it is based on real events adds that bit of extra excitement and besides, who doesn't love an underdog story?The direction from Blomkamp is crisp and clean yet also energetic and chaotic, which makes for a visually engaging film. You really feel the excitement and thrill and danger of the racing, which was crucial to establish and get across, and was handled well.In terms of performances, Archie Madekwe is a really solid lead, bringing a strong emotional presence and charisma to his character. David Harbour brings his character to life perfectly with a thoroughly engaging performance, and Djimon Hounsou is a scene stealer with some of the more emotional baggage.I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but I was impressed! It has an unbelievable story to tell and it does it very effectively. A lot of it feels quite derivative of the underdog sports film genre, but the great direction and solid performances raise this film up above many of its peers, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining movie.~ethanbresnett rated 7/10 on 7 August 2023"," Wow! way better than I expected!!: Well, I love the game, so I knew I was going to go watched it, and it's really good if you are a fan of the game. The idea that you can make playing Gran Turismo so real that you would get recruited to drive an actual race car like it was your PlayStation is a Gamer's fantasy and it comes alive in a movie that's not a fantasy but a legit true story.Gran Turismo has got everything you need dramatically for a sports movie. The Trailers leading up to this film don't do it justice. It's got far more heart to it as it unfolds an amazing underdog story.Like the game it's based on it showcase every aspect of racing but now with a more personal touch.It's no Need for Speed but it's one of the best games adapted to a movie ever.~subxerogravity rated 7/10 on 10 August 2023"," Are video game films starting to be better?: Went into this not knowing the background of this film but came out pleasantly surprised with a great race car driving film but also a great video game film.If it weren't a true story, the concept would have been cool but definitely not believable and therefore no where near as good as it is.The racing and the direction taken to display the races was particularly impressive and at no point was it unclear what was going on. The acting was ok to begin with but got better as the film went on, especially with the emotional scenes. For me Harbour was the best actor in Gran turismo.The script was fine but did it's job well of portraying the stakes in high intensity scenes.Not really too much to fault as a true story racing film.~burntoutboy rated 8/10 on 7 August 2023"," Fire the Marketing: What an absolutely fun romp of a movie that was done a great disservice by its advertising campaigns. Unlike its very bad marketing would have you believe this is a great watch with an engaging story, anger inducing antagonists and some amazing acting performances, David Harbour is especially good as Jan's main guy. Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere. Overall though, it's a great watch and I would highly recommend you ignore the trailers (that give away a weird amount of the plot) and go watch this film.~taylormellors rated 7/10 on 7 August 2023"," Didn't expect it to be this good: Gran Turismo (2023)Racing games are probably my least favorite because I get enough road rage in real life. However I do enjoy an occasional well made racing film like Ford vs Ferrari or Rush. Even though Gran Turismo is a highly popular video game, or racing simulator, this film is NOT a video game adaptation because quite frankly there isn't much to adapt. Instead, it's simply an underdog story that involves a video game and the impact that it had on real life events, kind of like what the film Tetris was. However, this one is quite an unreal story and the entire time I couldn't believe that these events actually occurred.The movie is about an expert Gran Turismo player named Jann. He is considered to be the failure of the family as all he does is play video games but one day, he receives an invitation to participate in an online race. The winner of the race will get chance to compete for a spot to become an actual racer for team Nissan. Sitting with a controller is quite different from being behind an actual wheel of a 300 km/h car and soon enough Jann and other competitors will realize what they signed up for.I know some people have been criticizing the start of the film but for me, it was one enjoyable experience that kept getting progressively better. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the sports drama genre but it takes on an intriguing true story and executes it well. The video game inserts looked good and the actual racing scenes very exciting to watch. David Harbour put on an impactful performance of an inspiring aged mentor who gradually passed down his wisdom to the young and inexperienced protagonist.From the negatives, the editing looked slightly weird at times but it didn't take away from the experience as the action and drama scenes hit home. The fast paced story kept me excited the entire time and I remember holding my breath more than once. Whether you enjoy good underdog stories, play racing games or like cars in general, you are going to have a good time in the cinema.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.~arabnikita rated 8/10 on 18 August 2023"
Next Goal Wins (2023) - IMDb,6.6,Michael Fassbender|Oscar Kightley|Kaimana|David Fane|Rachel House|Beulah Koale|Taika Waititi|Will Arnett|Elisabeth Moss|Uli Latukefu|Sisa Grey|Semu Filipo|Chris Alosio|Lehi Makisi Falepapalangi|Ioane Goodhue|Hio Pelesasa|Wil Kahele|Rhys Darby,Taika Waititi,Taika Waititi|Iain Morris,"The story of the infamously terrible American Samoa soccer team, known for a brutal 2001 FIFA match they lost 31-0."," Good enough, pretty fun.: I was really excited when this ended up being the Monday mystery movie. I had been looking forward to it, I didn't expect it to be great, just wanted it to be fun and it is.It's classic Taika Waititi humor, much like Ryan Reynolds; you need to like the person to enjoy their movies because their films are simply extensions of themselves and their humor. If you're not a fan of Taika, this might not be your cup of tea.The movie is genuinely fun and funny. Every character appears incompetent, yet many seem to have life figured out. Bad analogy, but it's akin to watching a child play something badly or a homeless man dancing in the rain, dog chasing it's tail-technically futile, but they have no worries and are having the time of their lives. There's an innocence and purity to them, and despite their shortcomings, the movie remains uplifting.Michael Fassbender felt miscast, but considering it's based on a true story, maybe he was a perfect fit as the actual coach in real life? However, still felt the movie would've been better served if the actual team took the spotlight instead of the coach. A case where the supporting characters outshone the lead.The 5 stages of grief bit was really funny. I kind of wish they had called ""the Hollywood"" the Neymar. What happened to the bleeding guy in the clinic? He was so random.Really cool underdog story, reminiscent of sports comedies from my primary school years in the late 2000s. Like a movie Adam Sandler should've been in. While the plot is one that's been done many times, it feels refreshing touch because it's been a while since a film like this was made.The movie emotionally kicks into high gear in the last third. The daughter's voicemails added a great emotional touch, providing depth without being too obvious until their purpose is revealed. I found myself asking ""why?"" a lot-pick up the phone. The movie's nothing extraordinary but it's decent.~AfricanBro rated 6/10 on 10 November 2023"," A loveable cast makes up for a lot: Next Goal Wins is a winning crowd pleaser that, like its loveable cast of characters, isn't the best at what it does but makes sure to have a good time doing it. It's weird to see an earnest version of a Dances With Wolves style narrative in 2023 and like previous Taika films, undercuts some of the emotional beats for humour. Luckily, the heart of the film still manages to shine through it all.Michael Fassbender proves he's a really talented comedic actor purely because he plays everything completely straight, which works wonders for all the comedy. Oscar Kightley is the MVP though, that endless optimism wins you over instantly and the film wisely knows to keep him around for as much as possible.Taika Waititi's direction is so recognisably him, mostly for the better. Even though too many emotional moments are undercut, the jokes themselves are consistently funny. Starting from the first scene the jokes are landing and they rarely miss. Whilst the final match isn't the most thrilling, Taika does successfully draw out the result as much as possible for maximum impact.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 30 December 2023"," Fun Film for Anyone: The movie was funny, breezy and entertaining. Saw this at TIFF opening, and the crowd had a blast. Every scene has a laugh in it, and there's a couple sappy moments that made you feel. This is a return to roots for Waititi and has the same tone as his earlier break through films, but his signature quirkiness is a little toned down. I would probably recommend this to anyone who can enjoy a feel good film.Fassbender did well in the role, and played the straight man often before diving into the comedy himself. However, the standout is. Kaimana as. Jaiyah Saelua, who I hope pops up again in film. Not to say the film was perfect, but I found very little to complain about and is thus far my film of the festival for TIFF 2023.~elvinortizesp rated 9/10 on 13 September 2023"," The Goal Is Comedic Fun And Inspiration.: LIKES:The Music:-It's a small like, as this movie isn't known for the most picturesque or unique arrange of music, it does use the small number of songs to its advantage.-Orchestral numbers that feel straight out of a sports' movie fill the action moments, orchestral pieces matching the moment of the sport and the intensity of what is to come.-Training montages and recruitment sections are filled with other fun tracks, those inspiring tracks that get stuck in your head and are filled with just good vibes and good times.-Again, minor in terms of scale, I always appreciate a good soundtrack to lift something up.The Acting:Another colorful cast brought together, Waititi has fun with the group he has assembled, using the American-Samoan culture to make a lot of fun in this simpler movie.-Kaimana, new to me, plays the transgender role well. A bit stereotypical, and a bit in your face, but nevertheless works as the character evolves past the political point and into something more. There is sass, edge, vulnerability, and feminine charm in the movement that turned out to be inspiring rather than annoying for me.-Kightley is fun. A very awkward humor that he executes well, with positivity and sincerity that fits the bill in the promised feel good movie moments. His dialogue is catchy, his comedic prowess is fun, and dare I say, I just love how well he and Fassbender get alone in this film. Certainly not the deepest role, but I applaud how he balanced the quirky Taika comedy, with the sincerity of the show.-Fassbender is still a magnificent magician of the acting world, and this movie only further shows how much I like his diversity. He's passionate, poetic, alcohol infused, and inspirational all in one, and was just so good at delivering his lines to have that bite. His engagement with the characters matches the referenced coach's passion, alongside his natural ability to capitalize on every word uttered. It's simply quite awesome and magical how he pulls out a good role and doesn't go over the top unless directed to.The Dialogue-Waititi is quite famous for his written words and turn of phrase that makes his movies so memorable. And in this film, there is still that clever wording that I can't quite believe seems natural and forced at the same time.-The movie has these odd metaphors that feel very belonging to the island, wise, but silly at the same time, and timed so well that I chuckled at the response the actors had with it.-But then turns back to these moments of inspiration that are harsh, funny, and direct insulting, but somehow not crossing the border and having me laugh.-Then, the writing somehow goes back to silly and off the beaten path candor, these indirect presentations that though random, work in the moment to ad a comedic punch and mirror the reverie of storytelling.-And yet still, there are moments where the rawness of vulnerability comes out and really inspires and moves you to be better.-The whole thing seems messy at first, but as the movie progresses, gets better as you grow accustom to the odd turns of phrase, the weird balance, and get to know the character's point in the movie.The Comedy... to an Extent:-I laughed and chuckled a bit in this movie, those key moments so fun and well executed that I was in stitches from just how simple they delivered the lines.-In the case of slapstick humor, there is crashing, hitting, harmful, and over the top theatrics that are the typical soccer sports. It works because most of the time it's not overdone, and there was writing to support the humor.-As mentioned above, the dialogue has those moments that are surprisingly fun and complicated, a mix of witty and silly that again just seems to be perfectly timed to match the fun.-And even some of the more forced moments are thrilling to enjoy, when done in balance and not over and over, really pack that comedic punch Waititi is known for having.The Inspirational Moments:-The story is cliché, and the predictability is there, but, the movie does indeed accomplish the goal of being that feel good movie of the year.-The character development of the coach alone has some hard hitting life lessons that had my heart swelling with the promise of improving.-Meanwhile, the self-mockery and poking fun at the culture, only to turn it back towards something productive further made me nod at how well this movie is built to be funny and uplifting.-It's an odd dance of the two, and even the predictability can't hinder too much the presentation of inspiration, and how Taika's balance managed to still shine through.DISLIKES:Too Silly At Times:-The mockery can be fun, but like many things, sort of steps out of his boundaries and crosses the lines that might either be too much or too insulting depending on your perspective-Religion mockery can be a tad on the nose and blasphemous at times, but relatively in check and less used that we should be okay.-While the banter sometimes goes a tad too far for my liking that the moment is over and we are just going around circles with little reward for the investment in their time.The Movie Plot Feels Bland:-Certainly the writing and comedic styles are the center stage of this movie and a message as a secondary outlook, but the plot of the movie feels a bit of a mess and a bland one at that.-The struggle for soccer training seems very mismatched, the progress missing the movie magic spark that I go for in these films and telling the story with a little less accuracy to the real life events.-Secondary plots fall out the wayside, and only one major player, maybe two, gets an actual dive into a story to make them engaging, the major one being a bit on the political agenda, but still kept in check.-Then even the ending feels like a Waititi finish, funny, humorous, but sort of just done, only to fade into the typical summary of where they are now.-For the guy that brought us Free Guy and Thor Ragnarök, I can't help but feel there was more to this tale, but the silliness I feel dictated the finesse of the story.The Character Usage:-It's not the worst, but at the same time, not the best when a former Disney movie about kids playing soccer does it better than this.-There are a lot of characters introduced in this film, but I didn't really care about most of them, because they were not used that much and quite honestly boring when there was a lot a potential.-A star player, a goalie or two, even some of the other members all just feel flat and lacking, only discernible because of anatomical landmarks than character ones. It's a bit sad, as again there was a lot of potential, but the time constraints of a comedy often mean... this is a sacrifice.The Soccer Match Itself:-I've seen plenty of sports movies that do their bouts right, but this movie... well... it doesn't do the bouts very well and misses the magic for me.-No coordinated bouts of soccer prowess going against each other, no impressive moves, or even suspenseful action moments I like in these flicks. And yet... we have only another silly presentation that comedic, and has its moments, is very stale and not worth the buildup the training was trying to present.Will Arnett's Involvement:-Arnett has a silly style, I get that, but this just seemed a misfire for me in terms of his inclusion in this film.-Some stupid and darker humor is the strength of his, but otherwise another accessory character that is boring, not needed, and does little to add to the grand scheme of the movie.-A weaker antagonist, and actual weaker comedy presentation to the normal jack of all trades of humorous use just feels... weaker and a waste given the potential.The Verdict:Next Goal Wins is a complicated mess of fun, surprising heart, and inspiration all at the hands of the mad director of comedic messes. The comedy is a bit much at times, but the movie does a nice job entangling silliness to the heart, and keeping much of the laughs diverse and to lots of styles. My opinion for the real winner is the writing, this complex balance of moods, atmospheres, and personality that moves with the characters and makes for a fun movie that fits with the holiday season. The acting is good for this movie, delivering the lines solidly, and I felt there was a good chemistry that never lost the family feel. And yet, Waititi's direction still loses grasp on other elements in his mockery of the culture and getting the laughs out seems priority that the equilibrium shifts away from some of the other elements I find important. The character usage, the plot, and the soccer game itself are lackluster, mediocre, and quite disappointing when you know what could have come with it. And thus this movie is hard to determine if it's really good for the theater, or if this was meant for something like Hulu or Apple+. Thus, my scores for this movie are:Comedy/Drama/Sport: 7.0Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0.~rgkarim rated 7/10 on 18 November 2023"," The Bad News American Samoas: Greetings again from the darkness. It might seem that a team goal of merely scoring a goal is setting the sights a bit low, but then again, we are talking about the American Samoa soccer team that lost to Australia by the incredible score of 31-0 (not a typo) in a World Cup qualifier. Brought to you by the comedic genius of writer-director Taika Waititi and his co-writer Iain Morris (""The Inbetweeners""), it was filmed in Hawaii a few years ago and easily slides into the category of feel-good entertainment, despite the near-certainty that some will accuse Waititi of cultural insensitivity. Much of it is based on a true story.For those familiar with Waititi, you know that he's a quirky and talented New Zealander filmmaker behind such gems as JOJO RABBIT (his Oscar winner from 2019), THOR: RAGNAROK (2017, still my favorite non-Batman superhero movie), HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (2016, a hidden gem that I frequently recommend), and two terrific TV series, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Flight of the Conchords"". So, it's not surprising that this latest is a bit difficult to categorize. Is it a story of underdogs rising to discover their own self-worth? Or is it the story of a misguided, bitter coach rising to discover his own self-worth? Or is it the story of how culture bonds a community in the face of embarrassment? Or is it the touching story of the first non-binary trans person to play World Cup soccer? The film's weakness is that it's a bit of all without really being 'about' any. Instead, Waititi focuses on having a good time and making us smile.Michael Fassbender stars as Thomas Rongen, a soccer coach whose anger issues tend to boil over at the wrong times, costing him a marriage (Elisabeth Moss) and a premier coach gig. The federation (led by smarmy Will Arnet) cast him off to coach the worst team in the sport, American Samoa. Of course, Rongen drinks too much and sees himself as too good to coach the team of misfits, despite the warm welcome from Tavita Taumua (Oscar Kightley), the head of the Football Federation of American Samoa. Tavita's wife, Ruth, (the always humorous Rachel House), is a bit more direct as she sees Rongen for what he is.The 2014 World Cup qualifiers are fast-approaching, and Rongen and the players go through ups and downs ... and we do discover what is contributing to Rongen's bitterness. Not surprisingly, the Samoan culture helps him every bit as much as he helps the team. Most poignant is the arc of Jaiyah (played by Kaimana), a member of the fa'afafine community as a trans person ... again, based on a real-life person.Supporting work is provided by Rhys Darby (so good in ""Flight of the Conchords""), Luke Hemsworth, Angus Sampson, and Kaitlyn Dever. The best (and obvious) comparisons are THE BAD NEWS BEARS and THE MIGHTY DUCKS, only this time it's grown-ups rather than kids. An argument can be made (and I would) that Fassbender is miscast, but he's so talented, it doesn't hurt the film much. Sure, the story structure is a bit weak, as is the character development, however the film is quitey entertaining, as Waititi finds the humor without being offensive or condescending.Opens in theaters on November 17, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 6/10 on 16 November 2023"," Lukewarm meh, takes too long with tepid payoff.: OK small slice of life stuff that was based on a true story. Next Goal Wins wasn't horrible, but if you've seen the trailers you get the idea. There is nothing new here The jokes should have landed better for bigger laughs. The finish wasn't that soaring or heartwarming. If wrapped up too quickly after the storyline dragged on longer that it should have. Minor characters could have been developed better to help get a feel for the island people. It was OK but not as good or as clever as I expected it to be. This movie included the usual dose of diversity, but in this case it was true to the real story.~LBPFilmview rated 5/10 on 18 November 2023"," A funny movie about how to survive hitting rock bottom: This is a smart movie, not for the people looking for a formulaic plot. It starts out that way - misbehaving coach gets stuck with the worst team in the world. Moviegoers expecting a miracle will be disappointed, because this is (mostly) a true story. And truth is always a bit more complicated.But, it's also not taking's itself too seriously, which is absolutely necessary for the story. It's meant to be dumb and silly, which is ironically what makes it so smart (Yes, that's right). That's why this is for intelligent people who see hardship as the best stuff of life, not that which we must fix to be ""whole"" people. It's anti-perfectionism and against worshipping advantages over character. Which is what smart people know is most important.Often, I want a movie that is like a fairytale - that gives me pure escapism. And, I'm certainly not one to nitpick entertainment for not being ""realistic"", and it annoys me when people complain about that when it clearly wasn't the intention of a film. And, those movies make me laugh and feel happy, and that's great. But, that joy is not like real life. With a film like Next Goal Wins, there is an opportunity to experience true joy for something real, which makes it refreshingly different.I felt cringe for the coach's drinking and terrible behavior. Unlike I suspect many, I saw his back story coming. I also felt his personal disappointment for his wife's unfortunate romantic choices. He is not a perfect character, nor is he meant to be. My favorite scene is probably the team's little pre-game performance at the final game - it is the climax before the resolution. As I expected what came next, it was a satisfying and cathartic ending to me.As someone who knows what hitting bottom feels like, I can attest that this film is true at heart. There is not a miraculous undoing of the past. That's just not how life works. And, that's not how you move forward. If you get this message, you will love this movie.~sherylchilders82 rated 7/10 on 30 November 2023"," AMC screen unseen: I really liked it, I saw it with AMC screen unseen, so I didn't know what I would get, but I laughed and cared! It was well done, and entertaining! It is definitely worth checking out. I had never heard of the story before but after seeing the movie I did some googling and it based on a documentary. It follows a team that wasn't expected to do well, with an asshole coach, but they learn to come together to figure out how to get ""one goal.""It really makes you want to get to know the island, people and culture. It's a film for all ages and worth checking out! The crowd really enjoyed it too.

I honestly can't believe that this movie was made by the same artist who created the hilariously witty 'What We do in the Shadows'. While 'Jojo Rabbit' was divisive, its originality landed Taika numerous awards, including an Academy Award for screenplay.However, this screenplay seems like one of the absolute laziest in years. If you told me that this was the first script ever written by a film student, I would have believed you. As the story is based on real characters and an actual event (and was also the subject of a 2014 documentary), what did Taika add here besides a few obvious jokes and some cheap references? If you've seen the trailer, sorry but you've seen most of the jokes, with the exception of the many movie references that are so desperately trying. This movie can't even trust its audience to get the references; it has to literally have the characters say ""like in The Matrix"", ""like in the Karate Kid"", and ""that's from Any Given Sunday"". Towards the end, it tries to take a more serious tone to give some of the characters a semblance of development, but it all feels too little, too late.On a positive note, most of the actors (except Will Arnett doing his typical shtick and Taika in an odd cameo) do a good job of trying to get me invested in the team, even if the writing and directing ultimately let them down.~alachtman rated 4/10 on 20 November 2023"," Finding Your Inner Strength: I saw Next Goal Wins, starring Michael Fassbender-the X_Men movies, Jonah Hex; Elisabeth Moss-The Handmaid's Tale, The Invisible Man_2020; Will Arnett-Arrested Development_tv, Jonah Hex and Beulah Koale-Hawaii Five_O_tv, Thank You For Your Service.This movie is based on a true story and is written & directed by Taika Waititi, who also has a cameo as a Samoan Priest in the film. This is a feel good movie about some underdogs finding their inner strength and purpose. The Samoan soccer team had a terrible game record. In a game against Australia, they had the worst loss in World Cup history-they lost 31 to 0 in 2001. Michael plays Thomas Rongen, a soccer coach that has a temper and is being punished by becoming the new coach for the Samoan team. The team owner tells Michael that he would be happy if the team could just score 1 goal. Elisabeth plays Michael's wife and Will is one of the bosses on the soccer commission that sends Michael to Samoa. Beulah is one of the Samoan soccer players and the Samoan team had one of the first transgender players on their team. If you stay until after the end credits, there is a scene with Taika. Overall, it's a heartwarming family friendly film that you should enjoy, if your are a sports fan.It's rated PG-13 for language, alcohol use and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I'm not a sports fan, so I wouldn't buy it on DVD. But if you are, it would be a good one to stream.~stevendbeard rated 7/10 on 18 November 2023"

Bonnie Stoll (Jodie Foster) is her longtime best friend and fleeting lesbian lover. It's 2010 and Nyad is drifting to her 60th birthday. Despite not doing big swims for the last 30 years, she decides to tackle her failed swim from Cuba to Florida when she was only 28. They hire local expert John Bartlett (Rhys Ifans) to guide them through the difficult currents.It's the true story of Nyad who is allegedly the first to swim the Florida Strait unassisted. Married couple directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi do mostly documentaries of extreme adventurers. They are dipping their toes into bigger budget fares and this one has some big name actors. Annette Bening is striped down and is not afraid of looking ugly, both outside and inside. Nyad is not the most cuddly character. Jodie Foster is simply magnificent. She is way over-qualified to be second banana. Rhys Ifans rounds out the big three. The movie follows the standard sports movie profile. I would put more of her swim during 28 year old in the opening act. They need to accentuate her failed swim which would make her decision that much more compelling. This movie has one big surprise laugh and I wouldn't mind having more. Most of all, I love the relationship between Diana and Bonnie. It helps to have two great actresses playing these lived-in characters. They make this standard sports movie come alive.~SnoopyStyle rated 7/10 on 5 November 2023"," Age is just a number.: The wonderful and uplifting story of Diana Nyad, who decides at 60 to complete her lifelong ambition, to swim from Cuba to Florida, a feat she couldn't achieve aged 28.Netflix haven't had the best time of it this year, but they certainly pulled it out of the bag with this one, it's a cracking movie.It's uplifting, it's daring, it's an adventure, a truly motivational story. Both Annette Bening and Jodie Foster are tremendous 8n third respective roles.Now, I know it's superficial to comment on people's appearances, but can I just say how wonderful it is to see two natural looking actresses, for real, how refreshing.I loved the music throughout the film, some real classics were chosen, including The Sound of Silence.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 30 November 2023"," Amazing? No. But still worth your time: In a day and age where most movies are steeped in cynicism, there's something oddly refreshing about Nyad. Yes, parts may be clunky, it may take a while to get going, and it doesn't reinvent the biopic formula, but it's still an ultimately successful crowdpleaser.In terms of its inspirational story, Nyad follows a pretty straightforward plot of the titular characters attempts to swim from Cuba to Florida. This underdog/triumph of the human spirit storyline is by no means new, but it's handled here with honesty and care. The start of things is rough-the first actual shot of Bening as Nyad is almost unintentionally funny, and it's pretty obvious that the actors are not totally comfortable with their characters early on. But, much like Nyad herself, the movie gets better over time as the technical quality improves and the actors are able to flex their skills, and by the end you're cheering right alongside the crowds for her success.Diana Nyad, as a figure, is quite complicated. There's no doubt that she's has some incredible achievements, but she's also been reported as self-centered, dishonest, and in general rather controversial. Walking in to Nyad, I feared that the filmmakers would opt to completely gloss over this to be more simple (and palatable to Oscar voters), but thankfully this is not the case. The movie chugs along with its traditional empowerment story, but along the way there's tension between Nyad and her companions as her arrogance threatens to derail the swim. A lesson about ""the power of teamwork"" may seem cliche, and to an extent, it is. But the movie's exploration of the way perceptions change based on your own humility adds an interesting texture to the proceedings that not all filmmakers would seek to include.One of the most talked-about things regarding this movie is the acting, and for the most part, it delivers. Annette Bening as Nyad is thoroughly convincing and able to sell this rather idealistic yet egocentric woman without being totally unlikable, and the physical strength it must have taken to perform the swimming is impressive. It takes a while for her to fully warm up to the role, but once she does it's a strong turn. Bening had a job and she delivered.But the star of the show here is Jodie Foster. She imbues her character with so much personality and life force that she disappears into the role and is easily the best part about the whole film. Foster's not given amazing dialogue to work with, and yet through sheer talent, she pulls the movie together to craft a complex portrait of a woman torn between dedication to her friend and her own self-actualization. If nothing else, watch this movie for her performance.In the age of streaming this is exactly the sort of thing to fall under the radar were it not for awards season, but it has more heart than most film's you can find on Netflix. This is not an incredibly well-made movie, but it doesn't need to be. The core thing that makes a story like this work is the emotional impact, and it delivers. Nyad's an imperfect but satisfying film, uplifting and well-acted enough to be worth a watch.Finally score: 68/100.~Lockout_Salties rated 7/10 on 25 October 2023"," pursuing a dream: Greetings again from the darkness. All great athletes aren't great competitors, and all great competitors aren't great athletes. But when the two merge, the result is elite. Think Michael Jordan, Muhammed Ali, Novak Djokovic, Tiger Woods, and Michael Phelps. Of course, there are others, and this biopic focuses on one you might not have previously considered since she's so unique. Diana Nyad was a world class distance swimmer and had a tremendous career prior to becoming an analyst and commentator for ABC Sports. She had a career that made her famous in her field and a well-respected sports personality ... but that's not what made her the focus of this film from co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, the Oscar winning duo behind the extraordinary documentary FREE SOLO (2018).In 2010, after a surprise 60th birthday party thrown for her by her friend Bonnie Stoll, Diana Nyad made up her mind to make the ""Mount Everest"" of open water swims ... from Cuba to Florida. Mind you, Nyad had failed on her attempt at this swim when she was 28 years old and in peak form. And yes, everyone thought she was a bit crazy and tried to talk her out of it. The swim is 103 miles, and the dangers included box jellyfish, sharks, and unpredictable weather and currents, not to mention the stamina and physical health required. But Diana would not be swayed from her goal.Annette Bening stars as Nyad, and two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster co-stars as best friend Bonnie. As remarkable as Nyad's marathon swim goal was, much of the film focuses on the journey of friendship between Diana and Bonnie, especially once Bonnie takes on the role of coach and trainer. Their relationship (and the actors' performances) is the strength of the film. We feel the love and the frustrations. Diana's extreme level of determination (and hard-headedness) is paired with her equally extreme level of self-absorption and narcissism. Bonnie's loyalty is tested daily and over many years.Why many years? The answer to that is in the number of failures Nyad experiences on her quest to complete the swim. The multiple attempts allow us to get familiar with the crew, especially navigator John Bartlett, played by the always interesting Rhys Ifans. The relationship between the crew and the swimmer builds the bridge between isolation and team sport. We see Diana use 4/4 music for the rhythm of her strokes and to keep her mind from wandering (or worse). The mental aspect of distance swimming is just as challenging as the physical side.The story continues through 2013 at age 64, when we learn that the rules mean both ankles must be out of the water for the swim to count ... this after more than two full days and nights of swimming. Screenwriter Julia Cox has adapted the story from Diana Nyad's memoir, ""Find a Way"", and Oscar winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (LIFE OF PI) works wonders in capturing the enormity of the swim as well as the intimacy of this deep friendship and the commitment of the crew.Flashbacks of Diana's childhood are shown, which clue us in on what motivated her to push her body and mind to extremes. The film begins with a recap of Nyad's swimming career to ensure that viewers understand what a decorated athlete she was. Annette Bening is terrific here and it will be interesting to see if, after four previous nominations, this is the role that delivers that elusive gold statue. As for Jodie Foster, her rare screen appearances make it too easy to forget just how amazing she can be - it's nice to be reminded (be on the lookout for her in the new season of ""True Detective"" next year). Music by two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat works well on the swims, and Nyad's dreams (and misses) inspire us to pursue our own ... even if our dreams are a bit less dramatic than ""Mount Everest.""Opens in select theaters on October 20, 2023 and streams on Netflix November 3, 2023.~ferguson-6 rated 7/10 on 19 October 2023"," Conventional but still really good: Nyad is an incredible true story told in a pretty standard biopic fashion. It's a testament to never giving up, showing that there's still so much to be accomplished in later life but what helps this film really swim instead of sinking in a sea of similar competition is the two screen icons at the centre of it all.Annette Bening has a physically demanding role that she embodies convincingly and equally impressive is how she makes Diana Nyad self obsessed without being irredeemable. Jodie Foster is superb, it's always so nice when she comes back and the chemistry between them is really strong.It's built on Foster's constant support and the moment it's pushed to a breaking point that leads to the most satisfying moment with Bening gaining a newfound appreciation for others' sacrifices. Rhys Ifans has truly found his shtick, adding another gruff character with a heart of gold to his back catalogue.Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin do a good job of merging the style of their documentaries with a more traditional biopic. It's only the more surreal moments that don't really work but they're still visually exciting and something a little unique in something that's mostly operating on the well worn formula.~masonsaul rated 7/10 on 3 November 2023"," Annette Benning's full commitment to the part just like Nyad herself: This movie will tug at your heartstrings as it truly has an inspirational ending. I vaguely remember this news story back from 2013, and frankly the subject matter itself does not lure me in; instead I tune in because of Jodie Foster and Annette Benning. So that proves that those two acting legends are a wise choice for this production. Annette Benning's commitment to portray Diana Nyad with all her might almost equals the level of commitment and almost-insanity that Nyad herself exhibited during her quest to do the long-distance swim in her 60s. Jodie Foster further adds that extra layer of poignancy with her intense performance. I am glad for having seen the movie, but this feels more like a solid, uplifting documentary that happens to be reenacted, as opposed to a movie made to entertain you.~julieshotmail rated 7/10 on 7 November 2023"," Godot on the water: I thought this could be boring but was a little interested, as I have placed a toe in the water of ""endurance"" with a few marathons over the years and an ironman at 70. These efforts are a 50 metre jog compared to what Diana Nyad attempted in the proposed swim from Cuba to Florida (110 miles). She had failed when younger but decided to try again at 60.The subject matter is not intrinsically exciting but the film is saved by good direction from Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo), a clever script and excellent acting throughout, - especially from the 2 leads Annette Bening and Jodie Foster. I have met a few of these ""ultra"" people, utterly consumed by their current passion, the latest gruelling masochistic challenge, which has blotted out their view of anything or anyone else around them. Bening has wonderfully captured this character (- ?psychopathology). The single purposed mania to achieve 'this' - leavened by the occasional sobering insight of the selfishness and, maybe, craziness of it all. The friendship between the 2 ladies was well drawn and affecting.I found the film surprisingly absorbing. To witness a great athlete with inspiring self-belief, the drama of the swim(s) and to see 2 talented actors at the height of their craft, was worth seeing.~Jaffaroll rated 8/10 on 23 October 2023"," Annette Bening's performance towers over this film: As ""Nyad"" (2023 release; 121 min) opens, we see news footage from the mid-late 1970s when marathon swimmer Diane Nyad sets several marks. We then go to ""Los Angeles, August 22, 2010"" and Nyad decides that she is going to try and swim from Havana to Key West, even though she is now 60 and she failed in her earlier attempt 30 years ago... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Oscar-winning co-directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi andJimmy Chin (""Free Solo""). Here they look at another extreme sport (marathon swimming) but rather than doing a documentary about Nyad, they decide to do a biopic recreating the events. I very much respect the co-directors, and have seen most of their movies. That said, the movie succeeds mostly because of Annette Bening's fearless performance. Yes, Jodie Foster is good too, but nowhere near the level of Bening, sorry. There is also a pleasant original score, courtesy of Oscar-winning Alexandre Desplat. There are several things I didn't like about the movie but since they related to ""plot', I'll remain silent and you can figure it out yourself.""Nyad"" premiered at the Telluride film festival a few months back, to good critical acclaim.

To continue to go after our dreams and if we fall down, it's ok, and let's get up again and continue.I have no idea what kind of fire Diana had inside her to keep going after this dream, but she went for it and fulfilled her dream.I always wonder what kind of superpower these folks have that goes after this stuff and doesn't give up.Diana is truly an extraordinary human, with some kind of spirit that doesn't know what ''comfortable'' means.

I know it's become a bit of an overused adage nowadays but this feels like the kind of movie we just don't get anymore.I've missed Ben Affleck as a director so much. I've liked every movie he's directed so far (even Live By Night) and this movie shows just how capable he is behind the camera. His directing is a big part of the reason why this film is as captivating as it is. He never just reverts to simple shot/reverse shot between actors during these long dialogue scenes but instead keeps the characters moving and energetic and it keeps the scenes visually interesting. Its also extremely well edited with the film being kept at a brisk pace with a runtime that feels just right for this story.But the dialogue here is unbelievable. It's consistently sharp and witty throughout and it keeps the conversations engaging without ever being showy or overwritten. As much as I love Aaron Sorkin dialogue his scenes can often come across as words written by a professional screenwriter rather than genuine interactions between characters but that's not the case here at all. But Air does what Sorkin scripts like the Social Network and Moneyball do extremely successfully and take very non-cinematic subject matters and makes them riveting, captivating watches.I was a bit mixed on Affleck's choice to never directly show Michael Jordan on screen. I understand the creative choice but the attempts to hide Jordan on screen often came across as more distracting than I think it would've been had Jordan just been portrayed as an actual character by an actor giving a performance.But overall this was a great watch. I'm so glad Amazon are giving this a full theatrical release because it deserves to be seen on the big screen and I sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come not just from Amazon but streamers as a whole.~cdjh-81125 rated 9/10 on 28 March 2023"," Ben Affleck Directs Another Winner: I'm a pretty big fan of films that revolve around the behind-the-scenes drama of professional sports. Films like Air will always grab my attention and become a must-see in my mind. For that reason alone, on top of knowing that Ben Affleck directed it, I had high hopes as well. After seeing it, I'm happy to say that I had a great time at the movies. This supremely written film deserves your attention and here's why.Decades ago, the company of Nike wasn't worth all that much and not many athletes even wanted to be sponsored by them. Air tells the story of Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a man who is on the verge of his career ending, when he gets the crazy idea to put the entire good will and fortune of the Nike brand at risk. He risks everything to try and get Michael Jordan to agree to sign with them, thus designing what is widely known now as the Air Jordan shoe. It's a very simple story about a man who knows the potential of something, while everyone around him thinks what he wants to accomplish is impossible. It's an underdog story that's not even directly about an athlete and it's done incredibly well.The star of this film is easily Alex Convery. You haven't heard of him? Well, until today I hadn't either. He is the screenwriter of this film and the dialogue from start to finish is what took this film from the generic true story category to something that's a must-watch. This is his first screenplay, ever. Yes, a film that I will currently call my favourite of the year so far, was written by a guy who had never written a feature film outside of this one (at least none that got made). Hearing about this just made me ludicrously excited that people still get chances taken on them in Hollywood. Convery wrote a terrific screenplay here and I hope he continues to get work.Ben Affleck does a great job directing this film, getting fantastic performances out of everyone involved. Matt Damon is committed and it's one of his best performances in years. Jason Bateman's dry humour is all over this movie and I couldn't get enough of it. Viola Davis as Michael Jordan's mother was also great (as always), but who really stood out to me as the MVP was Chris Tucker. He's both funny and hits all the dramatic beats his character required. I haven't seen him in a meaty role like this in a while and I was pleasantly surprised.Look, I'm not about to sit here and say this is one of the best films of all time or that it's groundbreaking in any way, but Air just ticked all the boxes of enjoyment for me. Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, it's fun to watch and even though you know how the story ends, it's still very engaging. For non-sports fans or people who don't know about sponsorships and how they work in professional sports, I think Air is still a movie for you because it never showcases any actual Basketball (other than on a television) and the inner workings of this company is just interesting in general. Air is now playing in theatres and I think many people will enjoy it. I absolutely recommend this one.~kjproulx rated 9/10 on 15 April 2023"," Really solid entertainment: This is an extremely engaging and entertaining film that manages to mine suspense out of a story you already know the ending of. You know that Nike ... at the time the third place loser in the basketball shoe market ... managed to get Michael Jordan to sign with them and created the Air Jordan shoe. To a large degree the film is about HOW Sonny Vaccaro (in the form of Matt Damon) pulled off this feat, but it also makes you doubt IF it's going to happen. That's good storytelling.It's also a pretty funny film ... more than I expected. Mostly due to Jason Bateman, Chris Turcker (who I am not a fan of, but is really quite good here) and a bravely self-deprecating Ben Affleck, although Dave Messina steals many scenes as Jordan's agent.It's really so well put together than you start to forget that Nike is hardly an underdog, and this is really a film about a multi-billion dollar company becoming even bigger and making a soon-to-be-very-wealthy athlete even wealthier. It's a nice trick.My only real complaint about the film is that it's WAY too dedicated to reminding you that it's set in 1984.~rdoyle29 rated 8/10 on 12 April 2023"," Affleck bounces back as a director: This was a nice surprise. After the shaky Live By Night in 2016 (which I think was affected more by executive meddling than anything else), Ben Affleck took a break from directing, and now has a mini comeback of sorts with Air. It's been about a decade since I watched his other films (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo), but I remember liking them quite a bit, and enough to say that Air feels like a return to form for Affleck as a director.It's most comparable to Argo in that it takes an interesting story from history, and gives it a classic Hollywood level of polish that makes things a bit snappier, more entertaining, and a little funnier, too. Here, it's all about Nike trying to partner with a young Michael Jordan in the mid-80s. I know nothing about basketball, but have always known Jordan and Nike go together. So the film's only likely to be suspenseful for those who've been living under particularly large rocks for a particularly long time, but it's not so much the what that's interesting, but the how.The cast all give very strong performances, and between this and The Last Duel, I have to say that I think Affleck's even better in supporting roles than lead ones. It moves well and kept me interested for nearly two hours, even though the story on paper wasn't one I thought I'd find interesting. That's the sign of a good movie, sometimes.However, Air's not quite a slam dunk. The writing takes some jarring shortcuts here and there, and keeping this under two hours also made for some occasionally weird edits. And the soundtrack may have laid it on a little thick at times (but hearing two Violent Femmes tracks was cool, and not only is Bruce Springsteen discussed in dialogue, but he's also in the soundtrack, which is always a win in my book).Affleck and Damon haven't had a big win in a while, but they made a good movie together here and I hope it does well. It's worth seeking out for the clean, efficient, and all-around solid entertainment it provides.~Jeremy_Urquhart rated 7/10 on 5 April 2023"," Absolutely NOT a sports fan, but really liked this movie: I actually rated it at 7.5 stars. Ben Affleck's acting wasn't as good as we know it could have been. The strain of being on both sides of the camera showed - but damn he was great as a director!! Also felt that Chris Tucker's usual comedy set him apart for such a strong part.So, I am absolutely NOT a sports fan and I don't wear Air Jordan shoes. HOWEVER, it was fun to see that Peter Moore, the original creator of the shoe, did, indeed, make them a work of art from the very beginning - once he was given free reign. That made me the happiest!! I DO love looking at Air Jordan's and they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!This movie about sports and sport clothes was brilliantly done due to the fact that everyone in it felt free to be very natural.Some reviewers don't like that we never see Michael Jordan's face. I did like it. He is FAR too well-known to be played by an actor. AND this movie really wan't about him, per se. It was very much about his mother and what she did not only for him, but for everyone in sports.This is a movie for everyone. ENJOY!!~thejdrage rated 8/10 on 18 May 2023"," Makes You Care About Shoes for 2 Hours: Return to form for Mr. Ben Affleck. He managed to get me out to the theater to see a movie about Nike. Not necessarily a shoe guy, however this movie paints the picture as to why people invest in these shoes. The directing was fantastic. Stellar cast. Matt Damon bringing his A Game as always. Chris Tucker just added his magic to this movie. Jason Bateman just being a supporting character was interesting, but his story really added to the stakes of the movie. The pacing was a little off here, and there but the story, and cast really allows this movie to breathe in away you don't worry about the pace like that. Definitely give this flick a chance if you like start up films.~dmoorejr rated 8/10 on 2 April 2023"," Beauty in Simplicity: We need more films like this right now. No agenda. No politics. Just an interesting (and true) story that entertains us. Write some dialogue, grab some cameras, get solid actors, and go to work. There's nothing complicated in this film. There no mystery to solve, no giant set pieces, just a fantastic time on the screen. The 80s are shown a ton of love in every aspect of the film. I am liking Matt Damon more as an actor as his career moves on. He's not above setting his star power aside and concentrate on being an actor and it works so well here. Too much can never be said about Ben Affleck as a director. He's one of the best working right now. As solid a movie as you will ever watch.~gwzct rated 9/10 on 15 May 2023"," Can Ben Affleck and Matt Damon always make movies together: I managed to watch this at an early screening and I was pleasantly surprised.Of course most people know Michael Jordan and how he arguably is the best basketball player of all time and potentially best athlete of all time. But I bet a fair few people don't know the behind the doors story of how the most popular sneaker came into creation. This is where Air comes in.Right from the very start, the movie brings you along for the journey, engaging at every possible moment instead of just telling it to your face. The script was really well written to achieve this.The acting was too notch, particularly from Damon and Davis. At times you forget they are portraying real people.It was surprisingly funny at times and whilst you know the end of the story, the movie still gets you routing for everything to work out.For me, this is the first Oscar worthy film of the year (primarily for acting and screenplay) but credit should also be given to Afflecks direction. Just like Argo, he's got another directorial hit and his hands.~burntoutboy rated 9/10 on 29 March 2023"," So damn good!: Ben Affleck directed and co-starred in this so well; Alex Convery wrote it with glorious talent! For someone that doesn't really keep up much with sports this was enthralling, very informative, and quite entertaining. I loved Air I can't praise enough I had a lot of fun. The comedy was better than expected especially everything with Chris Messina and Matt Damon bantering. I wasn't sure why Micheal Jordan barely had lines at all even though the movie had a lot to do with him even that was crafty, the bulk is about Nike corporation which was all great. I hope the ratings/reviews get plenty of praise even awards.~UniqueParticle rated 9/10 on 5 April 2023"," Surprisingly entertaining biopic about the rise of a sports brand: Nike are now synonymous with sports and sportswear, and Adidas's great rivals, however it wasn't always that way and this little film explains how they did it.This film started off as a made for streaming movie, small(ish) in scale and with a decent but not spectacular budget. However the casting of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (both in front of and behind the camera) really brought it up to another level. Whilst the final result still feels like a glorified TV movie, Damon is excellent as usual and for once Affleck doesn't seem to be punching above his weight as an actor. This is actually a very well made and acted film, although the slight story may not be to everyone's taste.Viola Davis and Julius Tannon also turn in a good performances as Michael Jordan's devoted parents. There are also solid turns from Chris Tucker (looking a few pounds heavier than the last time I saw him in anything worthwhile) and Jason Bateman amongst others.It's an interesting subject matter and I enjoyed the soundtrack too (many 80s songs of my youth) although it does have a lot of swearing so may not be appropriate for all. Ben Affleck is a very capable director and this is another good movie from him. If you enjoyed more recent biopic films like 'The Founder' and 'Steve Jobs' then you should enjoy this.~trevorwomble rated 8/10 on 7 April 2023"

For each of his roles. But , in this case, I adore him. Because he is real great. Because the""chemistry "" between him and Matt Damon is perfect. But the film gives more . An admirable portrait of Enzo Ferrari by Remo Girone,fine job of Noah Jupe , Tracy Letts proposing a great Henry Ford II and each scene being admirable crafted. A film about race, family and passion. A special one, in high measure, in profound sense.~Kirpianuscus rated NA on 29 August 2020"," Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be: I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.~zkonedog rated 9/10 on 17 February 2020", old fashion greatness: Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie.~SnoopyStyle rated 8/10 on 24 February 2020," Best Race Car Movie Ever? 💯: Gut level racing movie with no need to manufacture fictional drama - Fact takes over the drama (with some embellishments) throughout Ford v Ferrari, with its glorious on-the-edge engagement fueled by the Hi-Test performances of its two stars, Matt Damon and Christian Bale.Being a former SCCA racer (in my 20's), my bucket list need for speed took me to the track to live out my childhood dream of racing cars, and I did an admirable job at winning races at one of the lowest levels possible in racing - but it was always about being the best that I knew I could be (and could afford as car racing gets very expensive as you move up to the higher performance level cars), which as it turns out was better than anyone else at that level.Hill took that to the top production and competition levels of racing (financed primarily by competing manufacturers utilizing endurance racing to showcase their design prowess in making the World's greatest race cars, and those independents with extremely deep pockets), illustrating the universal need race car drivers have to validate their abilities, which is magnified 100-fold at this top professional racing level.This is a great film as filmmaking goes, whether one is a race fan or a movie fan, and deserved its nominations and awards. Best race car movie of all time?? X marks the spot, and that is 'Ford v Ferrari'. No brainer 10/10.👍👍~Instant_Palmer rated 10/10 on 15 March 2022"," Filled with Energy: Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.~kjproulx rated 9/10 on 10 September 2019"," Puts my faith in the movie business again: This is what cinema is supposed to be!

Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!~ymyuseda rated 10/10 on 20 November 2019"," ""We're gonna build a race car."": You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic ""Le Mans"" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world's longest endurance test. ""Le Mans"" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn't embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a 'spin' in a car under development. If there's any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford's race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him.~classicsoncall rated 8/10 on 15 February 2020"," An exhilarating and emotional ride: A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime.~Keemshave rated 9/10 on 21 November 2019"," Movie keeps you at 7000 rpm: Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama.~mohdshafiulhaque rated 9/10 on 23 November 2019"
Dodgeball (2004) - IMDb,6.7,Ben Stiller|Christine Taylor|Vince Vaughn|Rip Torn|Justin Long|Stephen Root|Joel David Moore|Chris Williams|Alan Tudyk|Missi Pyle|Jamal Duff|Gary Cole|Jason Bateman|Hank Azaria|Al Kaplon|Lance Armstrong|Chuck Norris|William Shatner,Rawson Marshall Thurber,Rawson Marshall Thurber,A group of misfits enter a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament in order to save their cherished local gym from the onslaught of a corporate health fitness chain.," Go Team Slapstick!: Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.~Coventry rated 7/10 on 27 September 2004"," Like chocolate cake: you know it's bad for you, but you can't help but love it: Silly metaphor, I know. The film ""Dodgeball: A true underdog story"" while maybe be offensive at times, the film really brings it back up to place with the humor. You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times. Sort of like ""Zoolander"", another great flick with Ben Stiller, it's so stupid you've gotta love it. I would recommend this film for a good laugh. As of movie of the year or comedy of the year, no, this is not the film. But it was a good one to watch. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. I will warn though, if you get offended easily, this maybe not the film for you.8/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 8/10 on 12 January 2005"," superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags: Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)~Chris_Docker rated 7/10 on 3 October 2004"," If you can dodge a wrench.....: This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10.~g-bodyl rated 10/10 on 28 February 2008"," Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses: Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by non-paying members who are, shall we say, on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank, they face a 30-day deadline to come up with $50,000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail, they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount  with a little help from an ex-champion, they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.This film came to the UK on a wave of hype and praise but I was a little wary because I knew that the style of humour that it has can be very hit and miss. The film has the same plot that all these sorts of sports movies have and you pretty much know where it is going from the very start but, to be honest, how many people have come here for the engaging story? No  me neither! The humour is very silly and it will not appeal to everyone but I found it pretty funny with the out-of-the-blue stuff being the funniest; if you find it funny to hear the line 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity then this will be the film for you. It isn't as consistent as I would have liked because it does have a couple of patches where there are more misses than hits but generally I had a good hatful of laughs and, when not laughing I still had a smile on my face.Of course, like I said, this isn't for everybody and I'm sure many will see it as a juvenile  and it does seem to have been aimed at the young male side of the market. The downside of this is that the majority of the laughs are pretty basic and, as we are seeing too often recently, the old audience draw of girls kissing is wheeled out yet again. The casting also helps to a certain degree and do help a bit to cover the basic humour. Vaughn is cool and relaxed and, although you wouldn't call it 'acting' he is a likable lead. Stiller has a few dry moments but generally his 70's fitness freak steals every scene he is in. Taylor is pretty but you can't help feeling that the film is only using her when, for no reason other than titillation she is revealed as bisexual (with a girlfriend). Torn is funny if basic and Azaria is also funny. The support cast is more about off the wall characters than good writing or performances, but Long, Root, Moore, Tudyk and others are all OK. Cameos from Hasselhoff, Norris, Shatner and Lance Armstrong are all briefly amusing and, just like Best in Show, commentators Gary Cole and Jason Bateman do spot on spoofs of low-grade sports commentators and have lots of great lines between them.Overall this is not the funniest film EVER, as some critics have absurdly claimed  it simply isn't consistent enough for that accolade but it is still a pretty funny film if you are in the mood for silly humour and some pretty basic jokes. The use of easy draws such as female flesh, lesbianism and physical jokes is a bit of a downer when you think about it but I doubt many will complain when it is on. The cast generally do well and the material is funny and energetic enough to do the job, producing a silly film that is hardly memorable but will be fun while you're watching it.~bob the moo rated NA on 23 August 2004"," Forget the Nay Sayers!!, This is a Damn Funny Movie!!: I just watched Dodgeball last night and I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie in years, from Vince Vaughn finally being cast as a person you can like to Rip Torn who is always at his best as the sarcastic coach who is full of colorful one-liners, and I didn't start out as a Ben Stiller Fan, but his movies have seriously picked up in quality latelyFrom the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job, Gary Cole is especially amusing as the sports announcer and his always missing the point sidekick, The Dim bulb Chris Klein type Dimwit on Vince Vaughns team adds to the hilarity, and Missy Pyle(What A Babe!!)Forget what all the Negativity from the other reviewers state, this is a comedy, a comedy is meant to entertain, it is not Casablanca or the Producers, but it is not meant to be(****) Out Of (****)~MCETXCEM rated NA on 12 December 2004"," Pretty much as funny as they say it is: When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it.

Ben Stiller always puts in a shift, particularly when he has an outrageous oddball character play like he does here. Vince Vaughn is always watchable if rarely amazing. Christine Taylor was a great addition to the castThe plot is nice and lighthearted and fun, although it does have some totally unnecessary tangents (a pointless teen romance and an unfunny pirate being the main two). Despite never being overly funny it is entertaining, with an entirely predictable story that is pretty safe. Although it is a tad dated in parts.This is one of many comedies from the early noughties era that I'm glad are out there, because they always have a great cast and a distinctive comedy style that has a certain charm, but they rarely blow me away. A fun watch but nothing more.~ethanbresnett rated 6/10 on 14 March 2022"," Oh my God, this movie is funny!: I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in years. That's all I can really say about this movie. It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care.I could not stop laughing. There are so many jokes in this movie, you don't even have a chance to rest before the next one comes along.Ben Stiller as the ""evil"" White Goodman -- it's a classic character that should go down in the annals of comedy greatness. The announcers for ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"" (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) had me rolling in the aisles. Stephen Root is a comic genius as well, and Alan Tudyk as the random pirate (why? who cares!) was pure gold.Oh, and make sure you stay till the end of the credits...

I get what they were going for, and it's worthy of praise coming from such a small studio with such a low budget. I hope this isn't the last in this genre from DW.That said - wow. Not up to par of the classics it was marketed as. Airplane, Dodgeball, Blazing Saddles, Topic Thunder: it's none of those things. I think it could've been with some extra elbow grease and less confirmation bias in the studio.The criticism that many Christian movies get is that they focus too much on the message and not on the core story and quality of the film. Same issue here. I get they had some quality limitations, but I wish they would've waited to really hone in the story and make sure the lines packed a punch.Best parts are all the cameos. These are genuinely good and appreciated.Not sure why we needed the subtle dominatrix thing. Just another example of something that made me cock my head sideways and ask, ""Really? Necessary?""Overall, I know I'll make some people mad for not absolutely loving it, but it is what it is. They want quality content? I'm happy to be the critic for the next future success.

The pace veeeery slow.Camera and cinematography was perhaps the best part of the movie.I just did not find this entertaining.The whole thing kinda reminds me of when a bunch of guys get together and laugh at farts or when one of their buddies accidently hurts themselves.Moronic.

FYI not family friendly at all. While I am a fan of daily wire, i did have some reservations about them doing a full length film. However, the film delivered plenty of laughs which is ultimately what you want out of a comedy. Has some cringey parts, which is to be expected from a new director attempting a comedy. Some of the cringe factor is just the fact that it's really on the nose of a terrible facet of reality right now. Most of it was the entire character of Gwen. I loved all the cameos from the DW cast, it was great. Overall would recommend if you've got 90 minutes to kill.~gwsvob rated 7/10 on 4 December 2023"," Not my usually movie but some fairly awesome moments.: So this isn't my usual form of comedy. I'm not really into more vulgar jokes. But given the subject matter it's hardly surprising.Still it had some great moments. 1)The locker room convo with Winnie. 2) The final game. Adorable. 3) The twist ending. 4) The two unexpected cameos. 5) The expected cameos. 6) Matt Walsh smiling and hugging. Both awesome and unsettling.I'm mean ultimately it had its flaws but still pretty impressive for a movie that went from conception to premiere in nine months. Hmm. Was that a coincidence? Imagine how those flaws could've been polished up with a bit more time.Not exactly a family movie but it hit the real message without being cringe.I know plenty who hate DW will disagree with that last part, but I've seen far more cringy stuff the last five years from the other perspective.Everyone did well. Love it or hate it, you should see it before you judge it.~Lily-32 rated 9/10 on 2 December 2023"," Entertaining in it's own way: I am reminded of comedies that used to go to unsafe and non politically correct places just to get you to smile and for the most part this delivers on that... granted in a tongue and cheek lower budget sort of way but even so.It was certainly pushed as a bit of a political statement and to poke fun at media, the entertainment industry, and it's multitude of sponsors but i came away from it smiling as it has a nice ending that they put some thought into. The cameo's by dailywire personalities made me chuckle as well.Definitely worth the overall watch and a good effort that pokes fun at our culture and direction in ways that average everyday people will be able to identify with.~justair rated 7/10 on 8 December 2023"," A comedy that stands out from mediocre ones from Hollywood: Hollywood is too chicken to release any comedy like Dailywire's Lady Ballers today. That makes this comedy one of its kind today, daring to tackle today's serious maladies in the most irreverant way. It's a movie that doesn't take itself seriously so that it can tackle the subject matters (gender ideology, child grooming, trans movement, cancel culture, etc.) seriously. While the 1st half of the movie seems rather haphazard and random, the 2nd half is when the movie really ties up all the loose ends and the heart of the story shows itself. The acting is a mixed bag - some actors are better than the others. But one who truly stands out in this movie is young Rosie Seraphine Harper - she delivered her role extremely well despite having some of the most difficult lines in the movie! This is a comedy that dares to be different, dares to tell the truth and dares to cop the flack, and for that, I give kudos to Dailywire. I'm sure their future comedies will be refined and come back even stronger. Great start for comedies in Dailywire!~kiwijinxter rated 8/10 on 5 December 2023"," Reminds me older comedies I enjoyed: I will agree with other reviewers that it was more ""mature"" than I expected. However, look at what it's about. If we want this kind of conversation out of our schools, do we really expect a movie about it to be kid friendly?The cameos were pretty funny. There were parts that took me back to older comedies I really liked-Dodgeball and Pitch Perfect to name a couple.Two decades ago, I'd likely give this movie a solid 8. But since the quality of screenwriting has tanked since then, this movie deserves no less than a 10. Thank you for setting the bar higher than everyone else, DW.What was really interesting to me was the fact that so many of the actors in this movie are not trained actors. I must say that they were believable all the same. Yes, there were corny parts, but it was a corny comedy. It was supposed to hit like that. If you don't remember that kind of comedy, it's probably cause no one has been making them (or making any worthwhile) for a long time.I look forward to other shows and movies coming out of DW's studios in the future. This movie was a good laugh.~littleimpaired rated 10/10 on 9 December 2023"," Wanted to like this. Fail!: I love the DW, but this just wasn't it for us. Had huge potential and some funny moments. But this was not what I would call a ""conservative"" movie. There was talk of threesomes, scantily clad women that the camera zoomed in on, extra-marital sex, bondage, and at times it was vulgar and raunchy. Thought it was going to be clean and wholesome fun because some of their ads literally say that. It wasn't. It was oversexualized garbage. This is not for young kids at all. Had I known that going in my opinion might have changed a bit. I'm disappointed in the DW. Makes me question some of the people involved with this.~Vambfly rated 1/10 on 6 December 2023"

It's not hard to make a successful movie. It's simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichéd message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.Pretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.I'll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation? Yes, they could, and they did.Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed.Don't worry if you're not a racing fan; I assure you it's not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my '69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn't do it for me. That's another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.Animation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can't be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it's getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But impressive visuals are little comfort if I'm not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you're the kind of person who loves to go ""awwwww"" at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.As I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn't greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.It proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen's journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the ""slow down and enjoy the scenery"" message may seem a little routine, but it's a message I took to heart.Immediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I'm now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That's all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.See? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way.~TheMovieMark rated 8/10 on 9 June 2006"," All time classic of Gen Z childhood. Amazing.: This is EASILY the movie I've watched most in my life. Back when I was young, I would have this on repeat. My parents said I used to HAVE to watch this movie every day for a certain period of time or I would get mad. Well, until now, I hadn't seen it in like 6 years until now. It was just as I remember, and extremely nostalgic. I can't be bothered to wonder why this movie gets the hate that it does. In fact, it's one of the best Pixar films. Idk if the nostalgia is blinding me, but for me this was (so far) one of the better Pixar films. A great character arc for Lightning McQueen, an amazing redemption for Radiator Springs, just a magical movie. I will forever hold this movie close to me and never let go. Imo, this is one of THE movies.Fun fact: I own all 36 original car action figures from the race at the beginning.~pickle-92642 rated 9/10 on 28 July 2021"," Perfect for the Kid Who Loves Matchbox Racers - His Parents, Less So: There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.Revised thoughts, nearly three years later:My boys are absolutely bonkers for Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater right now, but had never actually seen the movie. Needless to say, they loved it, and I discovered that my own opinion has softened over time. Of course, it still can't hold a torch to the innocent humor of Toy Story, the sentimentality of Monsters, Inc. or the pulse-pounding twists of The Incredibles, but it fits in snugly on the second tier alongside A Bug's Life and Ratatouille. The theme may have seemed transparently concocted to sell merchandise, but as a product of the era when Pixar didn't do anything they didn't believe in, it still resonates with thoughtful care and well-placed emotion. Perhaps unfairly cast aside at first, it's a well-made, lovingly executed film that tugs shamelessly at the heart strings when its points bubble to the surface. I'd upgrade my score from 7 to 8/10.~drqshadow-reviews rated 8/10 on 18 July 2011"," What's So Bad About It?: People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. The story can be clichéd, a big city race car driver goes to a small town, caused a ruck, hates the small town, get to know them and realises he was a jerk and so on and so forth. To me I like this movie. It has some nice atmosphere with the small town and the American dessert of the well- known route 66 with the animation and I do like the world of cars. The story is good too and even though its not in the bar of such great films like the Toy Story series and Monsters Inc. from Pixar, it's good recommendable movie for your kids.~tommystans rated 9/10 on 23 June 2013"," Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Animated Gem: Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes.""After watching ""The Polar Express"" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' ""faces"" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.For me, watching an animated film for two hours is usually asking way too much but not with this film. It's so much fun to see and there are no boring lulls, yet the action after the first 10 minutes is light. The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.At times, the colors in here astounded me, especially with the nighttime scenes. The sound also is excellent, especially in the opening and closing race scenes. With surround speakers, it's almost like being at the track.The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.I can't say enough about this film. It's really good stuff for anyone of any age. I was extremely impressed. Oh, and as a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger .~ccthemovieman-1 rated 10/10 on 24 January 2007"," Exquisite and fun. Visuals steal the show.: Pixar again shows us their superior skills in 3D animation and to a lesser extent this time, the storytelling. There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.It's a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows. But nevertheless, it's all very cool stuff, and the story is entertaining enough. Cars is a must see Pixar film - even if the visuals steal the show.~randomStuff101 rated 8/10 on 24 June 2006"," Nice ride: As usual, you've gotta hand it to Pixar.In ""Cars,"" their latest film, they show why they are still the cream of the crop when it comes to the field they revolutionized more than a decade ago. Well, yeah, it doesn't have the sophistication and cleverness of ""The Incredibles,"" nor the universal appeal of both ""Toy Stories"" and ""Finding Nemo."" And I have to admit that the idea of animated cars was the least riveting as far as Pixar film premises are concerned. But as with its predecessors, beneath those excellently rendered 3D images is the soul that sets Pixar apart from what has become of most animated films nowadays.Up-and-coming rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is about to win the prestigious Piston Cup. The championship ends with Lightning finishing in a tie with legendary ""The King"" (Richard Petty), who is in his final race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton); thus, a tie-breaking race is set in California.But a road mishap leads Lightning to the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, a part of what was once Route 66, a place that once basked in glory, but has since been thrust into oblivion. There he meets an array of other cars - including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman!), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) - who teach him that ""life isn't about the destination but about the journey."" First of all, Pixar's animation is first-rate. It's that sort of greatness among their artists I can only geek about and dream of grasping while in my 3D animation classes. The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering (man, the reflections!). The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Even the old, vintage car models have that chic look that brings some of the essential charm of this film. There are lots to be admired on this film just for the brilliance in animation. But among those that stand out are the race itself, and when Doc Hudson gets to bring back his good old days. Somehow, it's like watching NASCAR on IMAX again, albeit minus the über-big screen and the 3-D effect.But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions. It still all boils down to the story and how it is told - the very essence of cinema. Granted, when it comes to the standards set by previous Pixar films, it isn't quite up there with it's predecessors; but considering how lofty the bar has reached and the mediocrity that has become of the genre in general, ""Cars"" more than gets the job done.As for the voice cast, Wilson brings that sort of cockiness to the protagonist of the story and it fits with his smug humor. Larry the Cable Guy gives Mater an amusingly disoriented state without being irritatingly so. You can't help but care about him and arguably, he's the nicest member of the cast. Newman lends an authoritative quality to Doc Hudson. (During the end credits, there's an in-joke about John Ratzenberger, who has his voice featured in all Pixar films thus far.) However, ultimately, the cast is somewhat unmemorable and lacking in diversity. The rest of the voice talents are also underused. Keaton's Chick Hicks is a formulaic one-dimensional villain, which could have utilized his voice more with a little more motivation for the car's part. But then again, that may be beside the movie's point.All in all, ""Cars"" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside. When it comes to the basis of their appeal, it doesn't keep up with the rest of Pixar films which have sped up far ahead and this may yet be their first underachiever. But for what it is and what it achieves, it's a nice ride.~Jay_Exiomo rated 8/10 on 8 June 2006"," best Pixar movie since Toy Story: upon entering the theater I wasn't expecting anything wow and big from pixar since the last few movies they made really didn't hit it off with me.

It has everything you could ever want in a movie plus a whole lot more.

I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.The most famous streak in sports is probably Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak. The most famous hit streak in film entertainment is probably Pixar's feature film animation streak. With ""Cars"", it's seven in row for outstanding storytelling that is well executed and is (or will be) rewarded with blockbuster box office grosses. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""A Bug's Life"" are the other six gems.The story is about Lightning McQueen a rookie NASCAR-type racer. Of course, he is a car and not a human; or, he is a human in the form of the car. Take your pick. Either way, he is not an attractive persona. He is selfish, unappreciative, greedy, two-faced and has no real friends. But, he is a great driver and is tied for The Piston (read Winston) Cup annual championship with two other drivers. On the way to the runoff race in California, he accidentally gets off in a sleepy and forgotten town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs.In this hillbilly hell of a town, he is punished for speeding and tearing up the road by the sheriff. As he serves his sentence with community work, he discovers the town is inhabited by rejects and misfits, who all have hearts of gold. Can they change Lightning and make him over to have positive traits like honesty, integrity, respect, honor, sacrifice, humility, and compassion? That's the drama that unfolds. Lightning is a hard case, and the outcome is always in doubt.The cars/people are incredible. Shortly into the movie you forget that the people are cars or the cars are people, you suspend disbelief, and you just begin to watch an engaging story about real people. The windshields are their eyes, and the grilles are their mouths, and they display emotions as well as any human actor. The story is serious and light-hearted at the same time. The puns are too numerous to catch. And this is a must-see-twice-to-get-it-all movie.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.~tollini rated 10/10 on 31 May 2006"," Pixar keep the good line: I found this movie to be enjoyable enough: Even when it is true that it wasn't at the same level than some of previous Pixar films (Such as ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"") it was a good film anyway, with an entertaining story and likable characters.Despite the strangeness of the premise of a world inhabited by living cars, the execution is fairly convincing, with a neat character development and many funny and heartwarming moments.Without being perfect, it managed to be something totally worth-watching from beginning to end, and in many ways this could be easily considered one of the best animated films from the year 2006 (Which was a terrible year, in my opinion) 7.5/10~Rectangular_businessman rated 7/10 on 14 January 2007"

In that regard `Chariots of Fire' is one of my favorite sports films.  What differentiates this film is that it is really a human story about sports rather than a pure sports story.  Based on a true story, it centers on two gifted athletes and their quest to run in the 1924 Olympics.  The first is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a haughty sprinter with an obsession for winning.  Abrahams, who is Jewish, is a man with something to prove, mostly to himself.  His rival is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the first man to ever beat him in a sprint.  Liddell is a devout Christian and runs for the glory of God.There is an exquisite interplay of subtle themes in this film underlying the obvious sports tale.  There is the contrast of motives.  Abraham runs to validate his feeling of personal power, and his preoccupation with winning is actually motivated by his fear of losing.  His quest is torturous, and ultimately his victory empty, more of a relief than a triumph.  Liddell runs out of a desire to repay God for the physical gifts he has been given.  He is at peace with himself, but at odds with all those who want to control him.  Their rivalry represents a battle between the forces of the physical and spiritual.  Other themes pervade the film.  We have undercurrents of bigotry against the Jewish runner, a man of whom Cambridge was begrudgingly proud while berating him behind his back.  We have sinister political attempts at manipulation in the face of Liddell's staunch integrity in adhering to his principles.  Together, these forces combine to produce a film rich in drama and meaning.The film has been criticized for its inaccuracies.  Some say Abraham did not suffer from anti-Semitic bigotry and that he was wildly popular at Cambridge.  This does not necessarily mean he didn't feel inferior.  No one can know what childhood experiences might have affected his psyche.  Jackson Scholz was quoted as saying he never gave Liddell a note of encouragement on the track.  I have to agree that this was a bit of Hollywood drivel that didn't need to be there.  Additionally, Liddell knew weeks before that the heats would be on a Sunday, not just before the race as shown, and he was always scheduled to run the 400-meter race.  The meeting of political bigwigs that allowed him to switch from the 100 to the 400 was pure fabrication to emphasize his resistance to compromising his beliefs about running on the Sabbath.  However, these liberties can be forgiven because they enriched the story and did not change history in major ways.The direction by Hugh Hudson is powerful.  Hudson captures the feeling and excitement of track and field competition, as well as giving us numerous beautifully photographed scenes and a wonderful period rendering.  Though nominated for an Oscar, Hudson was unable to capitalize on the success of this film, and he has directed very few, mostly minor films since.  The music by Vangelis is also wonderful, and it won the Best Music Oscar.Ben Cross is fantastic as Abrahams.  He brings great intensity to Abrahams' single-minded obsession for winning.  Cross hasn't done much film work since, but has had a long and distinguished career in TV.  Ian Charleson is also excellent as Liddell, but his career went the same route as Cross'.This minor film was the sleeper of 1981, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture.  I rated it a 10/10.  It combines the best elements of human drama and sport to create a potent and engrossing film.~FlickJunkie-2 rated 10/10 on 17 January 2001"," Great true story, wonderfully done: I watched this again last night. I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable ""other""! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the ""these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents"" theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of ""will they win?"" and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that ""Reds"" deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie ""The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution""). Those who say they cannot differentiate among the boys or between the Scottish and English accents - well, it sounds like some political statement to me. Do watch it - it's very fine, very moving, very exciting.~trpdean rated NA on 6 March 2002"," Truly an outstanding film.: I beg to differ with several previous reviewers.  This film is neither bland nor is it solely about professionalism vs. amateurism.This film is about what drives people to do what they do.  Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) runs for the glory of God, whereas Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs to prove his worth to a society that was anti-Semitic.  Even though they run for different reasons, their drive and determination spur them on. They stand up for what they believe in and refuse to sacrifice their principles because it is the easy way out. The supporting cast is also extraordinary, with Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell, Ian Holm and Sir John Gielgud all making important contributions to the final product. There is absolutely nothing unnecessary in this film.  The writing, the direction, the acting, the dialogue are all outstanding.  And then there's that haunting score.  Once again, this is truly an outstanding film. One with universal themes that transcend time and place.~Julie-30 rated 9/10 on 26 January 2003"," Two Men Who Ran: I'm not sure Chariots Of Fire deserved to be the Best Picture of 1981, I think Reds, Atlantic City, or On Golden Pond deserved that honor. But it's still quite the inspirational story of two men on the British track team of the 1924 Olympics who ran to prove something, but not the same thing.Ben Cross and Ian Charleson play Harold Abraham and Eric Liddell who are among the survivors of a lost generation to enter college, Cambridge to be precise in 1919, the year after World War I ended. It was called The Great War and the contemplation of another was too horrible to imagine. Cross as Abraham was a veteran of the war, though that fact is curiously downplayed in Chariots Of Fire.What is emphasized is his Jewish faith. Though Benjamin Disraeli had been Prime Minister and Lord Isaacs as Chief Justice and Sir Herbert Samuel never had to convert as Disraeli did for a political career, the very top of British society was still closed to Jews. I wonder if Ernest Hemingway had known the real Harold Abraham because he could have been a model for Robert Cohn in The Sun Also Rises. Abraham is not obnoxious like Cohn, but has reason for the chip on his shoulder as the Cambridge dons led by John Gielgud confront him about employing a 'professional' trainer. Gielgud could have been some mossback running the NCAA.Eric Liddell is running for his faith as well. He was not in the war, he was in China with his missionary father. Today he'd be a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, back in the day he typified what was then called 'muscular Christianity', the idea to show that being a Christian was not something for weaklings. Of course each in his own way makes his point, that in fact is the sum and substance of Chariots Of Fire. With Ian Charleson as Liddell, he makes an issue out of not running in an Olympic event held on the sabbath. I remember back in the day Sandy Koufax refusing to pitch in the World Series game held on Yom Kippur. Of course since the Dodgers also had Don Drysdale and Claude Osteen available at the time that was hardly a detriment. In fact the sabbath dispute over Liddell's views is solved in much the same manner.Chariots Of Fire is a nice depiction of the United Kingdom during the Twenties. It was not all the jazz age of partying, there were some very serious folk, even young folk at the time. Cross and Charleson play two such.There might be dispute over whether it was the Best Film of 1981, but the unforgettable musical score there was no doubt about. The awards that Chariots Of Fire won for Costume Design and Original Screenplay were also deserved.I think the value of Chariots Of Fire is that not only is it an inspirational film, but it takes place during an age when such things were scorned in some quarters. For that reason the film is both a good historical record and of timeless value.~bkoganbing rated 8/10 on 18 July 2009"," Fascinating drama based on true story of two runners , Eric Liddel and Harold Abraham , including unforgettable score by Vangelis: This is the story of two men who run to prove something to the world . They will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals , except their honor . Two young men fighting for their objectives , one a determined Jew Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and the other a devout Christian (Ian Charleson) . In a warmup 100 meter race, Scottish Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro coacher (Ian Holm) to prepare him . After that , both compete in the 1924 Olympics where their courage and determination to be tested . Eric Liddell , whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, denies to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee formed by high authorities (Nigel Davenport , Patrick Magee , David Yelland as Prince of Wales) . Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman/athletic advocate, respectively . In fact , during the Japanese occupation of China, Eric as a missionary was taken into the Japanese Weihsien internment Camp, where he was to die from a brain tumour just before the camp was liberated. This is is a sensitive as well as riveting story, being told in flashback , dealing with two young British sprinters , competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics , both of them compellingly performed by Ben Cross and the early deceased Ian Charleson . About six years after the film's release, Trinity College reenacted the quad dash with British Olympic athletes Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe taking part. This marvelous film has an all-star-cast such as Ben Cross ,Ian Charleson , Nigel Havers , Ian Holm , Cheryl Campbell and Alice Krige . Great secondary cast formed by prestigious British players and with a number of well known USA and UK performers for the tiny cameo roles such as John Gielgud ,Nigel Davenport , Lindsay Anderson , Patrick Magee , Peter Egan , Richard Griffiths and uncredited Kenneth Branagh as Cambridge student , Stephen Fry and first cinema film of Nicholas Farrell . Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher appeared as a favor to producer David Puttnam, waiving their fees, in order to attract finance from backers who wanted ""marquee names"" . Besides the lead actors, most of the white-clad runners training on West Sands in St. Andrews during the title sequence are St. Andrews golf caddies . Colorful and evocative cinematography by David Watkin filmed on location in Edinburgh, Scotland, Liverpool , Cambridge University , Eton College, Eton, Berkshire, England . When the athletes are running off the beach , in reality it results to be West Sands at St Andrews in Scotland , they run towards a large red building clearly marked as a hotel ; this is in fact Hamilton hall of residence, a student accommodation hall belonging to the University . Lavishly and luxuriously produced by great producer David Puttnam , he was looking for a story in the mold of A man for eternity (1966), regarding someone who follows their conscience ; he felt sports provided clear situations in this sense, and happened upon the story by accident while thumbing through an Olympic reference book in a rented house in Los Angeles , then the screenwriter Colin Welland took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics.Film debut by filmmaker Hugh Hudson , he originally wanted Vangelis' 1977 tune ""L'Enfant"", from his 1979 'Opera Sauvage' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with ""L'Enfant"" playing in the background for the runners to listen and pace to. Vangelis, however, finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme - and when he played the new and now-familiar ""Chariots of Fire"" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better. But the ""L'Enfant"" tune still made it into the film : When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of ""L'Enfant"" . Vangelis's electronic ""L'Enfant"" track eventually was used prominently in the film The years of living dangerously (1982). The picture deservedly won Academy Awards for Colin Welland's screenplay , Vangelis' magnificent soundtrack , Mila Canonero's costumes and Best picture .~ma-cortes rated 7/10 on 10 January 2015"," It IS A Big Deal, In More Ways Than One: I had never seen this movie until the fall of 1997 and after watching 40 minutes wondered, ""What's the big deal?""Well, the second half of the film and then subsequent viewings have done more than just answer my question.It's one of the RARE movies in the past 30 years which portrays a Christian in a positive light. Ian Charleson does a convincing job of portraying a 100 percent sincerely good man who walks the talk.In here is also a good portrayal of a Jewish man, a student at Cambridge, acted well by Ben Cross. This man is too defensive about being Jewish and carries a chip on his shoulder until the end where he comes out a hero and a fine man as well, the bitterness gone.The story of those two men and their quest for a gold medal at the 1924 Olympics in France makes for an inspiring film. It's also aided by very nice photography and a wonderful score by Vangelis. A recently-issued widescreen DVD finally shows off the award-winning cinematography. The feel- good ending doesn't hurt, either, especially since these main characters were real-life people.Her extraordinary beauty made Alice Krige an interesting person to watch in the film, and I wonder why she never made it as a ""big-name"" actress. Perhaps that was her decision.In summary, a very classy film, that still lives up to its reputation.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 2 November 2005"," Somehow Crossed the Finish-Line First: ""Chariots of Fire"" is a fine motion picture that won the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, even though it was the longest of long-shots.  The film deals with two young Englishmen (Ben Cross and Ian Charleson) who have hopes of glory at the 1924 Olympics.  We see that their struggles almost cost them the opportunity to achieve the greatness that they both desire.  When they are both ultimately successful, Charleson feels that his win is due to God's glory and accepts the medal with the greatest of pride and admiration. However, after Cross wins the gold he feels somewhat disappointed and realizes that what he thought he wanted was not what he really wanted at all.  The insight into this motion picture is amazing.  Both athletes convey very common feelings that most people experience if they are serious enough in what they are doing, whether it be sports or something else.  The main focus of ""Chariots of Fire"" is that the journey to get to the destination is more important and uplifting than the destination itself.  Many question the fact that this film won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Reds"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  However, this is one time I cannot say anything negative about the Academy's decision.  The fact that this film won in 1981 is testimony to the fact that the Academy is one of the greatest organizations in the world.  Kudos to all involved here.  5 stars out of 5.~tfrizzell rated NA on 29 July 2000"," This is one of the Oscar best pictures that actually deserved the honor.: I happened to be flipping channels today and saw this was on.  Since it had been several years since I last saw it I clicked it on, but didn't mean to stay.  As it happened, I found this film to be just as gripping now as it was before.  My own kids started watching it, too, and enjoyed it - which was even more satisfying for me considering the kind of current junk they're used to.  No, this is not an action-packed thriller, nor are there juicy love scenes between Abrahams and his actress girlfriend.  There is no ""colorful"" language to speak of; no politically correct agenda underlying its tale of a Cambridge Jew and Scottish Christian.This is a story about what drives people internally - what pushes them to excel or at least to make the attempt to do so.  It is a story about personal and societal values, loyalty, faith, desire to be accepted in society and healthy competition without the utter selfishness that characterizes so much of the athletic endeavors of our day.  Certainly the characters are not alike in their motivation, but the end result is the same as far as their accomplishments.My early adolescent son (whose favorite movies are all of the Star Wars movies and The Matrix) couldn't stop asking questions throughout the movie he was so hooked.  It was a great educational opportunity as well as entertainment.  If you've never seen this film or it's been a long time, I recommend it unabashedly, regardless of the labels many have tried to give it for being slow-paced or causing boredom.  In addition to the great story - based on real people and events - the photography and the music are fabulous and moving.  It's no mistake that this movie has been spoofed and otherwise stolen from in the last twenty years - it's an unforgettable movie and in my opinion its bashers are those who hate Oscar winners on principle or who don't like the philosophies espoused by its protagonists.~gachronicled rated 10/10 on 18 February 2001"," Still a wonderful film!: I loved the soundtrack to this film and I was glad to watch it on Oscar Sunday. It is worthy of its' Oscars and is based on a true story. The music can be haunting and beautiful at the same time. Vangelis is a musical genius. The cast is stellar with some new faces of actors and actresses like Alice Krige and even Ruby Wax if you look closely. The 1924 Olympics is the climax of the film. It's still a beautiful and wonderfully entertaining and educational film to be seen. I loved the cast including Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, and the young aspiring Olympic athletes including Brad Davis, Ian Charleson, and Ben Cross. The story is beautifully told in writing and the direction is brilliant to convey the beauty of the story. This is a feel good classic film from 1981.~Sylviastel rated 10/10 on 2 March 2004"," A movie about the fire within: Much more than just another sports movie, CoF analyzes the very different reasons two men have for devoting so much of their lives to training for the Olympics. This in an era when there were no commercial sponsors and no lucrative endorsement contracts. Though there is always fame and personal satisfaction, it seems to be implied that these things alone are insufficient to explain the special forces that drive these two men so much more than all the others.This is a truly beautiful movie about a different era, about competition and what may serve as motivation to compete--and perhaps about what kinds of motivation are healthy and what kinds are not.9/10~KFL rated 9/10 on 18 February 2001"

Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her. Well, the tag line says it all.This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film, it's really hard to really act like a guy. :D Well, it's true! 8/10~Smells_Like_Cheese rated 8/10 on 4 August 2006"," First Rate Teen Flick: I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!~cdelacroix1 rated 8/10 on 18 March 2006"," Roll in the aisles funny, a real blast!!: She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type ""chick flick"" films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my all time faves) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, ""Three's Company"" style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.Amanda Bynes is a star!! Even since the days of the horribly campy (yet strangely entertaining ""The Amanda Show"", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious. Previously her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well made ""What A Girl Wants."" If that wasn't her break out vehicle than She's The Man takes care of that hands down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next ""It"" girl. She is the All American, cute, down to earth, bubbly teen (although she's twenty now) and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. Not entirely...but believable enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious, non stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's ""Havoc"" by plays Duke. He's the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and eventually Bynes' object of affection, unfortunately he's also Sebastian's room mate (who is Bynes.) He's a good leading man, and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who again is Bynes.) She does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more, from a distance you could understand someone believing Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes terrific performance. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. He weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. The story which is loosely based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. It's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. There isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 9/10~Robert_duder rated 9/10 on 20 March 2006"," Just One of the Guys of the Soccer Team: When the Cornwall school cancels the women's soccer team, the player Viola (Amanda Bynes) is absolutely disappointed since the sport is her passion.

Viola falls in love for her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) that has a crush on Olivia Lennox (Laura Ramsey) that feels attracted by the sensitive Sebastian (indeed Viola) that is chased by his girlfriend Monique (Alex Breckenridge). Out of the blue, the real Sebastian anticipates his return from London and he is not aware of the situation and has to play soccer game against Cornwall.""He's the Man"" is a funny and entertaining comedy with a predictable story similar to the 1985 ""Just One of the Guys"". The cute Amanda Bynes does not look like a boy but her performance is pleasant. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ela é o Cara"" (""She is the Guy"")~claudio_carvalho rated 6/10 on 5 September 2010"," Completely Corny yet Still Very Entertaining: Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother, so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately, she immediately falls for her male roommate, who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.Combining the story of ""Just One of the Guys"" and Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night may sound like a recipe for disaster but She's the Man is a funny, charming and cheesy movie. The original trailer looked really lame yet the film turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story is clearly nothing new but it still works fine. The fact that the screenplay is written by Karen McCullah Lutz explains everything. She's good for harmless, fun films like She's the Man, Legally Blonde and Ella Enchanted. Andy Fickman does a decent job as the director. He never lets the film become too serious or else it would ruin the movie's appeal. He does overload on a few lame jokes though. That was the major problem I had with this film. Some of the jokes just fell flat while others were just incredibly cheesy, even for this film.The acting was good for this type of movie and most of the actors were enjoyable to watch on screen. Amanda Bynes is full of charm as Viola. It was very hard to actually hate her and she's a much better actress than Hilary Duff. Channing Tatum was not as strong as Amanda. His performance was okay, sometimes his reactions were a little fake. Laura Ramsey plays Olivia and she gives a decent performance. Alex Breckenridge gives a pretty good performance as Monique. Her character was pretty interesting and she had decent chemistry with Amanda. The rest of the supporting actors are good except for David Cross. He plays the school principal and his performance was not funny at all.If you do give She's the Man a shot then keep in mind that the entire film is highly unrealistic. I was reading some of the posts here and a few people are bashing the film for that. While the movie is pretty entertaining, it's also easily forgettable. It was a fun way to spend 100 minutes but it won't stay in your memory for long. It's also not just a chick flick and a guy could also like the movie. In the end, She's the Man is worth checking out whether that be in the theaters or on video. Rating 7/10~christian123 rated 6/10 on 18 May 2006"," Bynes and Company Score a Hat Trick: Though I hate to admit it, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have scored again. ""She's the Man"" is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the gender-bending action of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and drops it in the middle of a modern-day American boarding school. The premise should sound familiar because screenwriters Lutz and Smith also penned ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" another twist on Shakespeare, starring the likes of Julia Styles and Academy Award nominee Heath Ledger (before he was an Academy Award nominee).It's more of the same, of course, but seeing Shakespeare's work go Hollywood, and, thus, be ripped to shreds, continues to amuse. ""She's the Man"" also focuses on a decidedly less bitter heroine than the shrew, Katarina, played in 1999 by a very stilted Styles. If that makes the film less witty, who cares? Not half of this film's target audience, who came mostly to see Channing Tatum with his shirt off.Like Kat in ""10 Things,"" Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a tomboy and a soccer star on the women's team at Cornwall Prep. Her life is soccer, which becomes a problem when her school cuts the women from the sports program. Better than most of the boys, Viola wants to suit up with them but is snubbed by both the coach and the team's captain – her boyfriend. So it's ""end of discussion  end of relationship."" Viola hatches a plan to pursue her sporting dreams at rival school Illyria, where her twin brother has just enrolled. Twin brother, Sebastian, is skipping off to England for two weeks and nobody at Illyria has ever met him.If you missed the set up, read ""Twelfth Night."" It's pretty obvious what happens from here. Viola disguises herself as her brother and moves into the dorms where she meets her roommate and fellow soccer player Duke (Channing Tatum). She begins to gear up for Illyria's season opener against Cornwall and has to navigate a complicated love-triangle, in addition to other challenges like taking a shower alongside her male teammates, without them finding out about her girl parts.In reality, nobody who looks like Bynes could get away with impersonating a 17 year-old male. Viola is too pretty to be a boy; in other words, dressed as her brother, she makes Orlando Bloom look like a frost-bitten lumberjack. This fantasy aspect doesn't detract from the film, though. Viola puts on her wig and fake sideburns and, suddenly, she's the most socially awkward nerd-boy you've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief works.The Sebastian disguise doesn't have to be convincing. What matters is that all the other characters are oblivious to facts that are obvious to the audience. The laughs come from seeing Viola get away with a ridiculous scam. In one scene, Duke and fake Sebastian hug each other, but Viola slips out of character and gets a little too friendly. It's not that homoeroticism or homophobia are inherently funny, it's the knowledge that Duke is disturbed by being frisked by someone who is actually a girl that makes us laugh.Other than that, ""She's the Man"" offers audiences the simple pleasure of Amanda Bynes who seems to be a natural in comedic roles. Her Sebastian/Viola is definitely a caricature but it's a perfectly illustrated one. From her mixed-up half southern, half Canadian drawl (her misguided version of the typical teen boy cadence), to her crotch grabbing and Eminem-like posturing, Bynes has a lot of fun and, as a result, the jokes land.It's a teen movie, so the ending is typical and cheesy. While sister film ""10 Things I Hate About You"" had a wild feminist streak in it and touched on somewhat weighty issues, such as the pressure to have sex, ""She's the Man"" lacks a serious undercurrent. But this is probably a good thing. ""10 Things"" was, at times, too earnest and moralizing. ""She's the Man"" doesn't pretend to be more important than it is. It'll earn a spot on the shelf, in between ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Legally Blonde."" (And, like Reese, maybe Bynes will win an Oscar in 10 years. Anything is possible – just look at how ""Crash"" won Best Film.)Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson~Lauren_Simpson rated 6/10 on 16 March 2006"," Better than average teen comedy: I saw ""What a Girl Wants"" many years ago and liked the cute Amanda Bynes. Now I saw out another of her films. Yes, Amanda is absolutely great in this film. She plays a girl who disguises as a guy...tries to look confident but also is nervous... that is such multi-layered acting and she pulls it off so naturally.The story is about football (soccer), and even though I'm not a fan of sports it doesn't go too deep into that territory, and the game scenes are nicely shot, so that even a dummy understands what's happening in the field, and it looks cool.The amount of ""hot"" guys in this movie is quite big, so you can tell it's targeted for girls. But I could live with that because the story is funny to start with, the movie is well paced and doesn't become boring, and the acting is good.Bynes was such a promising young talent, and I'm sad that her career fell so short and she's had a rough life. I wish she could do a comeback someday.~SkullScreamerReturns rated 8/10 on 12 September 2021"," Charming: This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming coming of age movie.~phillipstephenso rated 9/10 on 12 May 2006"," Absolutely Hilarious: I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Sure there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me up. I thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good in acting out this comedy. I have to give kudos to Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were funny as well. Of course there were moments where you yell at the screen ""how can you not tell?"", but that's all part of the fun. In the end the plot turned out pretty well. There's a happy ending, but what'd you expect. Overall,just hilarious.~peppermintbuddi rated 10/10 on 21 March 2006"," outrageously funny!!!: I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I laughed SO hard -- literal out loud, deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. Granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. The actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.~soli1313 rated 9/10 on 22 March 2006"

Avildsen,Sylvester Stallone,A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect.," ""He doesn't know it's a show. He thinks it's a damn fight!"": One gains a certain degree of perspective with the passage of time, and one of the things I like to do is watch a movie that I saw upon it's original release and compare my feelings for it now to those I experienced back in the day. I thought ""Rocky"" was a great and inspiring movie back in 1976, and with only the slightest bit of hesitation, I think it delivers the same feelings today. I throw in that slight hesitation part because over the years, the sports underdog theme has been worked to death in cinema. But the thing about ""Rocky"" is that it's not so much a film about boxing as it is a film about life in general. A direction-less man with no goals suddenly finds the gold ring handed to him on a platter. Not that there isn't a whole lot of work involved to make that dream come true, but one has to recognize opportunity in the first place. I read with some amusement the negative reviews of the picture on this board and have to wonder how many of the nay-sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash the film for that simple lack of recognition. Because criticizing Rocky Balboa for talking like he had a mouth full of marbles is missing the point. He talked like that because he was a street punk working as an enforcer for a local mob boss, and the people he dealt with on a daily basis weren't exactly magna cum laude types. Nor was he going up against members of mensa whenever he climbed through the ring ropes at a local boxing joint.To prove he's not just another bum from the neighborhood, all Rocky wants to do, as he confesses to Adrian (Talia Shire) in that touching apartment scene, is go the distance with the champ. He doesn't have to knock him out, doesn't even have to win, just go the distance. You know, I still have to remind myself at times as I reflect on the picture that Rocky really didn't win the match. But he comes out a winner in the truest sense of the word, and that message blurs out the ring announcer's call of a split decision in favor of Apollo Creed. If there was no ""Rocky II"", (or III or IV or V), I wonder how many of the movie's fans would have been settled with the idea that Rocky Balboa actually became the world champion that day.~classicsoncall rated 10/10 on 2 January 2010"," The Raging Bull Named Rocky...: ""Rocky"" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, ""You have to be a moron to want to box.""Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before ""Rocky"" was ""Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,"" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in ""Rocky."" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his ""job"" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. ""An Italian found America,"" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about ""Rocky"" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, ""Are you sure she knows I'm coming?"" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, ""This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!"" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make ""Rocky"" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, ""Rocky"" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with ""Rocky"" all the more.~MovieAddict2016 rated 10/10 on 5 May 2003"," Yo!: Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell). When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.I watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downer—a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.Rocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.Those only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.Director John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb.~BA_Harrison rated 10/10 on 24 February 2016"," ""I ain't no bum, Mick. I ain't no bum."": A first-rate film that's about as close to perfect as any movie about boxing (or any other sport) that I've ever seen. The plot is very simple -- small-time boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific. Followed by a string of enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment. This one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that. It's one of those movies that becomes part of culture in a big way where everybody recognizes something from the film even if they've never seen it.~utgard14 rated 10/10 on 6 July 2015"," A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !: Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. And BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!!It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his ""fight"" in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity - just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G.

Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday."": It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, ""I'm at least half a bum.""~JFHunt rated 10/10 on 17 December 2004"," A great Sylvester Stallone film: If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed.~rbverhoef rated 9/10 on 18 February 2005"," NOT A BOXING MOVIE!: The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie.  In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan.  Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest).  Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter.  That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie.  In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart.  That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships.  A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank.  But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway.  The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a ""one-in-a-million shot"". It's something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.The largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien.  So that should maybe make this a ""love story"" movie instead of fighting movie.  Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her).  She won't open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can't help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.Another theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager.  In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words.  It's when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him.  Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside.  Rocky's life is being turned upside down by this whole ""fighting Creed"" business and although it is his dream, he doesn't know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he's not of the same caliber as the champ.  The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man.  His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand.  The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).This movie simply seeps with ""classic"", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of ""the indominable spirit of man"" (Rocky 3).  No matter the difficulties, Rocky's heart takes him through it all.  It doesn't fit the mold of today's classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti.  A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow.~forsaken999 rated 10/10 on 14 May 2000"," Stalone's best: As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.~mm-39 rated 9/10 on 9 April 2001"," The film cost a million and grossed over 100,000,000 domestically.....'nuff said.: I am not a huge boxing film fan. Well, that's not exactly true. I am not a fan of films that glamorize boxing. Movies like ""The Harder They Fall"", ""Requiem For a Heavyweight"" and ""Champion"" and ""The Set-Up"" are all wonderful films about the brutality and vicious nature of the 'sport' and are great indictments about what a terrible thing boxing is--and I heartily recommend them. However, ""Rocky"" is a rare film that glamorizes boxing (for the most part) and manages to deliver a film that you can't help but admire. Think about it. It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement. It is a great film and it's amazing that it was made by folks who no one really heard about up until then. Plus, when you read about how quickly Stallone penned the script, you can't help but admire it. A terrific film.~planktonrules rated 10/10 on 30 March 2013"

Yes it is predictable,but what makes it a great movie is the performances by the 2 main characters. Ralph Macchio is great as a teenager that is bullied at his new school. But the movie belongs to Pat Morita as Mr. Myagi. He plays an old apartment maintenance man that befriends Macchio. He becomes his karate teacher, but they develop a great friendship that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The great thing is that the movie shows that the old man comes to need the kid as much as the kid needs him, it is a touching relationship. All the rest is standard Rocky film stuff, but what Rocky and this film have in common is that the characters are people we care for, so all the climactic scene stuff works.~flicklover rated 9/10 on 30 December 2004"," ""The Old One"": My love of ""The Karate Kid"" is limited to the fact that this movie, if it had been in the hands of a more fluorescent director, could have turned out a lot differently from the movie we all know and love from 1984.Directed by John G. Avildsen (who also did 1976's ""Rocky"" - another underdog story) and written by Robert Mark Kamen (who would later co-author 2001's ""Kiss of the Dragon"" with Luc Besson, which starred Jet Li - another example of martial arts in American cinema done right), ""The Karate Kid"" is by far the best (and frankly, most realistic) incorporation of martial arts into a mainstream American film.This movie came out the year before I was born, and only through word-of-mouth over the time I was growing up, did I know that ""The Karate Kid"" even existed. I got to view the film my freshman year in high school as part of a class, but the instructor watered down the experience so much that the movie lost its potency.Now a few years later, I finally watch the movie without any intrusion from the outside world and I find a truly marvelous picture that's far better than its many stylized contemporaries, i.e. ""The Matrix"" trilogy, which is the best example of that trend.Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, a new kid to a picturesque southern California community that looks a lot like something you'd see in a magazine advertisement. Daniel makes the mistake of hitting on Ali (Elisabeth Shue), who unknown to him, is the ex-girlfriend of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), and Daniel takes a pretty brutal beating from the martial arts-trained Johnny, that leaves him scarred but with his pride and dignity still in tact.The number of violent clashes with Johnny and his brutal Cobra Kai martial arts friends continue, until Daniel is saved by Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the karate-trained handyman of his apartment building. Daniel insists on Mr. Miyagi teaching him karate, so that he can compete in an upcoming martial arts tournament; this requires Daniel to undergo some pretty unconventional training - ""wax on, wax off; paint fence - side to side"" etc. And in return, Daniel learns that there's a lot more to karate than just fighting and the ""Old One"" shows him that way.""The Karate Kid"" is a true gem of a film that's shamefully underrated. I'm glad that on February 1st of this year, this movie is finally getting the DVD treatment it deserves.Macchio is convincing as Daniel, bringing a number of wide-ranging emotions to his role that at first may seem quite perfunctory as opposed to being dramatic. The real star of the show (at least in the minds of a number of critics, and the Academy), is Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He brings grace (almost rivaling Bruce Lee) to a role that could have been quite stereotypical, but is still very moving and dramatic.Of course, what's a movie about karate without the fights? I should note that the action in this movie is very convincing, but is not stylized in any fashion, shape or form. It is very down-to-earth and realistic, and that may of course be a bit of a turn-off to some hardcore fanboys that may watch this movie thinking it'll be something like ""The Matrix"" (1999) or ""Enter the Dragon"" (1973).The fighting here is in its own style and mode of action. A number of the fights are quite brutal, especially in the ones where John Kreese's (Martin Kove) Cobra Kai students are featured, as he frequently trains them the brutal way of ""no mercy,"" which Mr. Miyagi is quick to realize is not the way of karate.""The Karate Kid"" gets a perfect 10/10.~dee.reid rated 10/10 on 23 January 2005"," Mr Miyagi is the mentor we all wish we had... A life impacting movie: Is there anything more that can be truly said of this inspiring movie? Possibly it is the most unlikely hit movie that has generated a strong faithful following.I rewatched it after 30 years on the back of falling for the Cobra Kai series, and loved it every bit as much as when I first saw it. I'm much older but find so many new things to relate to and remind myself of in life.The premise of the film is simple, but it is almost impossible to explain the impact this movie had on a certain young generation on its release. It was its run in the video market that made it the huge success it became, and so much of it has become part of pop culture be it in its quotable lines and simple action.What made it stand out was that it clearly was the antithesis of all other martial arts movies of the time which were in a boom period on video rental, but they were all muscle bound and flying around at 100mph. The Karate Kid instead centres on peace, life philosophy, defence and self-betterment.The crux is the central partnership between the central pair of Mr Miyagi and Daniel, which begins as teacher mentoring pupil but develops into a father & surrogate son relationship.There are so many layers to this film, and the truth is that the karate is really secondary to all. Any action is short, simple and down to earth. The real fights are for the soul, against bullies and personal defeat. For Mr Miyagi it is a reawakening for him, for Daniel it is a journey of self discovery.The greatest part is the acting. You simply can't take away from either of the two leads, the chemistry between them is just perfect. Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi almost effortlessly but perfectly as the mentor to a young insecure Daniel, which becomes a father and surrogate son relationship. If anything the relationship helps bring Mr Miyagi out of his shell. For example, we see inside the soul of Mr Miyagi, and some of his inner torment (i.e. loss of wife & child), and Daniel becomes closer to him for it.Mr Miyagi is the mentor & father all men wish they had. He practices & teaches peace & self-respect with humour & dignity. Something we can all learn from. His dry wit and personal reserve are humbling to see. Winning the tournament against the bullies is secondary, but the personal development is what comes first.The Oscar nomination for Pat Morita for the role was deserved, and unfortunate not to win it, but his role has left a lasting legacy and is in the hearts of so many. I can only say to him thank you, and also to all who helped put this wonderful touching film together.~joebloggscity rated 9/10 on 17 September 2019"," Still such a good film.: It's tough for Daniel, a teenager, who's moved with his mother from New Jersey to California, unable to fit in, Daniel is bullied and beaten by a group of boys from a local karate school. Daniel is rescued, mentored and trained by Mr Miyagi, Daniel gets a shot at taking on the bullies at their own game.This one one of my favourite films growing up, it really is a triumph over adversity story, with Daniel taking it straight to those that bullied him, and turning the tables.If you're a fan of those feel good 80's movies, then I'm convinced that you'll enjoy this, it really is an easy going, uplifting experience. It's loaded with iconic scenes, such as wax on, wax off and the ultimate kick scene. This film is definitely worth your time.This film helped bring a martial arts story to the masses, prior to that, you could argue that many of the martial arts themed films had something of a niche appeal,It always saddened me that Ralph Macchio didn't have a great career after this film, you would have thought that this would have set him up, it didn't, fortunately Cobra Kai had helped to redress the balance.The follow up films and the remake are all below average, and perhaps better off avoided, if you've not seen Cobra Kai, I would recommend it, it truly is the great follow up that this film deserved.Worth seeing.8/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 8/10 on 1 August 2023"," History and time give this movie a different feel: Done by the same director as Rocky, this unusual ""feel good"" movie became a hit in 1984 and generated two sequels before the mania died and the franchise imploded.I remember the phenomenon from the 80s yet as a ""prolific reviewer"" for the IMDb now (which, for buffs, is not the same thing as a ""Voracious Eater"" from the Claymore series) I now see the film differently.I see a very competently done film that is literally lifted off the ground and carried to the finish line by the extraordinary one-of-a-kind performance from a (then) 50 year old Pat Morita, an actor who essentially spent his entire career doing ""asian walkons"" and offers us only this one role as a chance to see what he actually could do. Given half a chance.Macchio and Shue were competent (the former had some momentum from Happy Days/Laverne and Shirley and the latter was beginning a short career as a type of ""brat pack"" teenage star) but it was Morita who owned the film and kept your interest.Unfortunately the historical record even on the IMDb does not reflect any of this. Shue actually won an award for a completely forgettable part and Morita not only did not win anything for this film but the only nominations he received were in the ""supporting role"" category. This is clear ""color blindness"" on the part of Hollywood. He has almost as much screen time as Macchio (I counted) but because his career was merely bit parts before (and after) this was the prevailing mindset. The film would have failed without him.As a footnote, I was not able to identify precisely why he was cast in the role, but historically Okinawa has indeed been associated with its own unique brand of martial arts and, in the martial arts world, short stocky older men have long been acknowledged as champions even though in the films of our present era someone of Morita's age or body-type would never even be considered for such a part.The two sequels were much weaker but the demand for them was great and, when there is money on the table, Hollywood will always oblige.~A_Different_Drummer rated 8/10 on 25 June 2017"," Think of it not as a Karate movie, more of a movie that happens to have Karate in it: The Karate Kid (1984)After seeing the teaser trailer for the forthcoming Cobra Kai TV show I got all nostalgic.So I decided to watch this movie again expecting it not to live up to the fond memories I had growing up in the 80's.Unlike me this movie has gotten better with age.It can now be regarded as a classic. Much more than a guilty pleasure. The Karate Kid is a fine movie that is very well made.For anyone who hasn't seen it the film tells the story of Daniel LaRusso played fantastically by Ralph Macchio.A young boy who moves with his mother to LA to start a new life.Unfortunately for Daniel San he soon falls foul of the local bullies.What's even more unfortunate is that the bullies happen to be Karate experts and they proceed to practice their moves on the new kid in town.Daniel then meets Handyman Mr Miyagi played to perfection by Pat Morita. Miyagi helps Daniel overcome the bullies by teaching him the true art of Karate.What develops is a very exciting and heartwarming story.Directed by John G Avildsen this movie is as much a story about an adolescent teenager searching for a father figure as it is a film about Karate.Think of it not as a Karate movie more of a movie that happens to have Karate in it.The chop socky action plays second fiddle here just as the boxing did in Rocky. A movie also directed by John G Avildsen.In fact the actual martial arts action equates to about twenty percent of the movies actual run time.At 2 hrs 6mins this film is not overly long because it is driven by strong character development.Everyone involved puts in a stellar performance.Morita and Macchio in particular are superb. Watching their friendship blossom as they work to achieve their goal is deeply moving.This is because in a way they both need each other.Daniel is a boy without a father and Miyagi is a father who lost his child.Because of this moving subplot the payoff at the end is all the more enjoyable as they achieve victory together.John G Avildsen surely knows how to rouse the spirit.The beautiful Elizabeth Shue plays Ali, Daniels love interest and apart from Mr Miyagi the only friend he's got.William Zabka stars as Johnny Lawrence the lead bully who actually is a flawed character.A good kid at heart who like his buddies have been brainwashed by nasty Karate instructor Kreece played with relish by Martin Kove.His performance here merits him a nomination for best villain of the 80's.As Myagi points out ""There's no such thing as bad student, only bad teacher!""This movie is packed full of moments and dialogue that are now embedded into pop culture.Even if you've never seen this film the phrase ""Wax on, wax off!"" will still be familiar to you.If not then you must have been living on the moon for the last thirty years or so.This movie is elevated by Bill Conti's fantastic score.Choosing him was the right choice just as it was choosing John G Avildsen to Direct .Conti's work on Rocky shows here as yet again he creates a score that will raise the spirit and get the audience punching the air when Daniel San administers that final blow.The movies soundtrack is also a peach, packed full of 80's classics that help stir up the nostalgia.The fight choreography is very well done. The combatants perform as they would in real life.There's no Bruce Lee levels of intricacy here. The fight scenes are grounded and apart from the cheesy crane kick at the end they are mostly believable.But as I strongly stated before The Karate Kid is much more than just a movie about fighting in the physical sense.It's a touching, heartwarming story about a boy fighting the struggles of adolescence. A boy just trying to fit in. A boy searching for guidance from a father figure he doesn't have.The Karate Kid unlike the silly sequels that followed can now definitely be regarded as a true movie classic~stevenrotherforth rated 10/10 on 10 March 2018"," Exceptional teen film from the 80s: While John Hughs' films may be the standard for teen flicks in the 1980s, Hughs' films were just a few of the great and unique teen films to be released in that decade. Coupled with Back to the Future, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the 80s was a rather unique time for teen movies. The Karate Kid just happened to be another one of those films. With the immortal Pat Morita leading the way, this film was not only touching, but put a whole new spin on the `zero-to-hero' story line which we have all seen too often. Ralph Macchio may have had no career after these film, but at least he proved to be comparable as Daniel (san). Sure, the ending and outcome proved to be a little predictable, but the film was still a winner.~Agent10 rated 7/10 on 8 August 2002"," Chronicle of the Downfall of a Champion: Johnny Lawrence had it all. Cheerleader girlfriend, a group of popular friends, a sweet dirt bike, and a leadership role at an afterschool program with the local martial arts studio. More importantly, he was the defending All Valley Karate Tournament champion.Things begin to spiral when new arrival Daniel, possibly with ties to the New Jersey mafia, starts to befoul Johnny's paradise. When Johnny makes the mistake of spending one night out with the guys, Daniel tries to stalk Johnny's lady, Ali, all across the beach with his corny soccer ball gimmicks and knowing looks over his wiener-roasting spit stake.Thus Mr. Lawrence's spiral begins. Though Johnny successfully defends himself from Daniel's cheap shot thuggery in an oceanside confrontation, Daniel will not be deterred from his obsession with the defending champ. Whether staking out Johnny's home dojo, trying to force-feed horse-history lessons on the school quad, or trying to bribe Ali with cafeteria munchables, Daniel continues his psych-war campaign which sadly has its desired effect.In one of the worst examples of harshing someone's mellow ever captured on film, Daniel ruins both Johnny's halloween costume and sweet green persuasion in an unprovoked aquatic attack in that most sacred of shrines, the public restroom. Finally at the end of his rope, Johnny harnesses his cardio training and precision striking to attempt to put an end to Daniel's abuse once and for all. However, it was not to be. Johnny sinks further into his personal abyss after being assaulted by a deranged handyman.Emboldened by his Okinawan ally, Daniel once again tries to interfere with Johnny and Ali's relationship. Just as the star-crossed lovers reunited with a passionate kiss at the local country club, Daniel managed to ruin the moment by intentionally spilling a huge platter of spaghetti, destroying a waiter's only tuxedo in the process.Somehow our imperfect hero Johnny manages to persevere through Daniel's demented parlor games, making his way once again to the finals of the All Valley tournament. Sadly capitalizing on a questionable disqualification, Daniel somehow makes his way to the finals as well against the incumbent title-holder. Milking a pseudo-injury for additional rest time, Daniel fake-limps to the mat for the final showdown. While we will never know if there was a deleted scene involving bribes to the shoddy referee, the calls made in the final best-of-five battle remove any doubt that Daniel either paid or blackmailed the official just enough to cheat his way into a 2-2 tie before stealing Johnny's trophy with an illegal kick.The film culminates in Johnny's Christlike forgiveness of Daniel's transgressions as Mr. Lawrence hands over the ill-gotten trophy to Daniel, a symbolic crucifixion with the crown of thorns represented by Johnny's ever-present headband.If you read this far you can probably tell I love this movie. 10/10.~Illini_Wrestling_Fan rated 10/10 on 30 August 2020"," A Cult of Many Generations: Lucille Larusso (Randee Heller) moves with her teenage son Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) from Newark, New Jersey, to Reseda, California to work in a better job in Rocket Computer Company. Daniel meets a neighbor in his building and tells him that he fights karate; the neighbor invites him to go to a party on the beach. Daniel meets the gorgeous and wealthy Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue) that lives in Encino and they immediately feel attracted by each other. However, the bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) comes with his gang of bad boys and argues with Ali, who was his former girlfriend. Daniel defends her and is beaten up and humiliated by Johnny in front of his new friends. Then Daniel is frequently bullied by Johnny and his four inseparable friends at school. One night, Daniel is saved by the handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who was born in Okinawa, from Johnny and his friends and he asks the old man to teach him karate. Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and goes to academy where Johnny and his friends learn karate and he asks their violent instructor John Kreese (Martin Kove) to order his students to give a break in the beatings; in return, he accepts that Daniel participates in an all-valley tournament two months later. Now Mr. Miyagi begins his non-orthodox training of Daniel, especially movements and balance waxing cars and painting fences. ""The Karate Kid"" is a cult-movie of many generations. I do not recall how many times I have seen this film, in the movie theater, on VHS and now on DVD, and I still love it. In the 80's, Ralph Macchio was a sensation with ""The Outsiders"", ""The Karate kid"" and ""Crossroads"" and his chemistry with Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita in ""The Karate Kid"" is something very special. This coming of age story discloses a beautiful friendship of Daniel and Muyagi; the discovery of the first love, with the romance of Daniel and Ali; and the message relative to the importance to find balance in life. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Karatê Kid – A Hora da Verdade"" (""Karate Kid - The Moment of Truth"")~claudio_carvalho rated 10/10 on 13 February 2012"," not just a teen movie: A lot of posts focus on the 'coming of age' aspect of this movie, but the very overlooked part is the role it played in helping to alleviate many of the stereotypes a very Asian phobic America was after WWII, Korea and Vietnam.They make a point of showing Miyagi in a US Army Uniform--and a War Hero-- and makes references to detention camps Miyagi's family was sent to (a horribly dark period in American history)...where Miyagi's wife was being sent (pregnant) and where she and his unborn child (son) ultimately die during childbirth. There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.~turd_furgusen rated 10/10 on 23 December 2004"
American Underdog (2021) - IMDb,7.1,Zachary Levi|Anna Paquin|Hayden Zaller|Ser'Darius Blain|Dennis Quaid|Chance Kelly|Simeon Castille|Bruce McGill|Adam Baldwin|Cindy Hogan|Nic Harris|Steven Chester Prince|Dean Denton|Kevin Downes|Cora Wilkerson|Morgana Shaw|Danny Vinson|Andrea Cohen,Andrew Erwin|Jon Erwin,Kurt Warner|Michael Silver|Jon Erwin,"The story of NFL MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner, who went from stocking shelves at a supermarket to becoming an American Football star."," The American Underdog Wins Big: I am only 4 years younger than Kurt Warner. And saw the path of which caused one of the most electrifying quarterbacks in American football history. I recall watching him zip a football so fast the camera couldn't follow. Corny as it may sound, I saw a guy who was desperate to win. Throughout the championship season, I kept hearing how in arena football there are no first downs. That this training embedded in Warner caused a massive shift in how we consume the sport. That the ""west coast offense"" overtook the ground and pound of previous years. His level of play stood out. It is also a credit to head coach Dick Vermeil (played here by Dennis Quaid) allowed this style of play to take over. Never mind the ball buster which was offensive coordinator Mike Martz (whom I kept thinking what a disaster of a head coach he was).That said, the movie itself is schmaltzy and corny. Two things I love in movies. There is nothing more sickening than when filmmakers today have to let their sucky life overpower their films. Life sucks for them, therefore, they need to express that suckiness onto you. Not this film. This movie is a very safe movie. Nothing cruel or hateful about it. Only made with a good heart.Now, I also recall Kurt Warner himself being a complete square. I can clearly recall how corny he was with his Christian beliefs. Very distinct in that you never saw a player more demonstrative of his faith. I thought ""Man, can this guy get any more lame"" This is as a result of the early 2000's. Now, as an adult I can see it was what righted his ship. As ""lame"" as Warner was, he gained the respect of everyone who ever doubted him.It's hard to get a gauge on how true this story really is. Almost seems phony. But the way actor Zachary Levi plays the man shows me the complexity of his situation. The climb to get to the top came with having a good heart. A true heart. And that is infinitely more respectable than fictional Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) in ""Any Given Sunday.""As most have mentioned there is little football in this movie. True. The true underdog part is paralleled with his girlfriend/future wife Brenda's (Anna Pacquin) son who is blind. The inspiration there is that he overcomes his malady to do the things that everyone doubts in him. The son doesn't know what he doesn't know and therefore presses forward in his own pursuits to do things in life a blind person cannot. It wouldn't surprise me if this observation isn't made in the book this movie is based on.Kurt Warner does deserve a film. Oftentimes we are saddled with biopics that seem to fall short of interest. I believe that is why most of the focus isn't on the football but on life. Because most won't know or care about the importance of professional football. It wasn't the football that Kurt hung his life on. That was pure icing on the cake. He overcame ageism to become one of the best in what he wanted to do. To many of us, this will tell you to get something you want to do and pursue it with all your heart. And, by the way, be sure to have someone to share it with. Because otherwise that victory is hollow.A wonderful message to hang a movie on.Those of you who are opposed to Christian messages may be turned off by the vanilla content. There are no guns being fired, no drug or alcohol abuse. It's wholesome as Hell. They are just simple Iowa natives who overcame adversity to prove to the ""big city folk"" country folk are talented as well (this is made very clear, Kurt's adverse reaction to country music).It is a nice simple story about simple people.Very nicely made flick.~statuskuo rated 8/10 on 5 January 2022"," Wow, what an incredible true-story.: As a huge NFL fan, I had heard of Warner, but had no clue about his story. This is clearly one of the best real-life underdog stories. The directing was decent, but the writing was a little slow and stale. It needed more action and suspense, and less happy-go-lucky vibes. The 112 min runtime and slow pacing really made the film feel dragged out. The casting and performances were spot-on and convincing, and although a fan of Zachary Levi (especially in Shazam!), I think his overly happy and smiling demeanor was too much to play Warner's character. I kept expecting to hear him yell Shazam! Nevertheless, he acted his heart out, as did Anna Paquin. Still, an amazing and emotional story (have the tissues nearby) and I'm really glad I watched it. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 7 February 2022"," Unique plot.: Powerful, this is just solid.

The acting is like no other and the cast was a great choice selection. It is definitely a must see film for the whole family.~colewaters rated 10/10 on 27 December 2021," Beautifully made, and much better than I thought it'd be: I was fifteen years old during the 1999 Rams season. I still remember the ""greatest show on turf"" like it was last year, even though it's now been 22 years. The Rams revolutionized the sport that season.""American Underdog"" left me speechless at times. Levi was believable enough as an athlete, but the major theme of the story is family and how sometimes winning isn't really winning if you don't have those to share it with. I had heard the Kurt Warner story a few times, but obviously not with this much detail and heart.As for the football scenes, I was blown away by how well they did. The play calling especially was well done. The trailer had me worried about the quality of football and my worries quickly subsided only after a few minutes of the film.The supporting cast also was impressive. I wish we saw more of the beautiful and talented Paquin, who portrayed Brenda Warner and knocked it out the park. Dennis Quaid plays Dick Vermiel and like usual, was awesome. I could go on and on.I mostly wanted to write this review for football fans (like me) who were skeptical of this film after the trailer. Please see it. I will definitely be buying this film for my personal collection. I hope you all enjoy it as well.~RJBrez rated 9/10 on 5 January 2022"," Feel-good in its great form: No disrespect but still screw the Rams.It's not the most unique plot of all, but it sure was a feel-good underdog story. I had a great time watching the story of Kurt Warner. It's great that the real people actually involved a lot in the production, because I felt the relationship between Warner and his family first charming, and then endearing. Another warm aspect was the amount of support that the side characters had for our main quarterback. I just can't help but feel inspired.Overall, it's another underdog story, but man it's a good one. 8.5/10.~Movi3DO rated 8/10 on 5 January 2022", Absolutely loved It: In these times of doom and misery you just need a film like this to give you a shot in the arm!Inspirational and very moving story.Just one great story and film.Had me jumping out of my seat for joy!Loved it...~tocanepauli rated 8/10 on 7 February 2022," Inspiring, true underdog sports flick: IN A NUTSHELL:I know I'm late to this party. This sports movie based on a true story was actually released over a month ago, but I haven't had time to watch it until now. I'm so glad I was finally able to see it. It's one of those underdog sports movies that we've seen many times before, but they always make you want to try a little harder in your life and go for your dreams. It definitely fits into the underdog sports movie formula, yet I never tire of watching that kind of movie.As you watch all of the struggles that Kurt Warner went through in his life to get where he is today, remember these fun facts: Kurt Warner is the only undrafted player to be named NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP, as well as the only undrafted quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory. He is also the first quarterback to win the Super Bowl during his first season as the primary starter. Warner was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and is the only player inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Arena Football Hall of Fame.The film is directed by the Erwin brothers: Andrew and Jon.THINGS I LIKED:I adore Zachary Levi. Who doesn't? There's a sweet moment where his character meets a little boy named Zach and says, ""That's a great name!"" He does a great job and has beefed up to be completely believable and awesome as a star football player. It was also nice to see his dramatic side. He's so doggone likable that it's easy to root for him as an actor and as the character on the screen.It was lovely seeing Academy Award winner Anna Paquin again. The last time I saw her was in the 2019 Oscar-nominated movie The Irishman.Football fans will love watching real footage from previous Superbowl games. If you're not a big football fan, you'll still have plenty to watch, as the movie is more about the man, his challenges, his family, and his perseverance.It's a football movie, so of course, Dennis Quaid is in it! This is his fourth football film! I love it when casting does a great job of selecting actors that look like the real people whose lives they're portraying. This movie does just that.The movie features Iowa as the setting for many of the events. My husband and I flew out to Iowa a few months ago just to see what it was like and to visit the graves of some of his ancestors who were buried there in the 1800s. His father attended Iowa State and we arrived in time for a tour of the campus as we watched the huge line of cars rolling in for the homecoming football game. Football is no joke in Iowa!I definitely understood the scene that illustrated the perilous situation of looking for a gas station when Kurt and Brenda were driving in Iowa. There are endless cornfields in that state with hardly any gas stations around, especially as you travel from town to town. You really have to be prepared before you drive out of the city!One of the things I love about this film is how Kurt Warner truly understood what's most important in life. It's not winning a bunch of football games or awards; it's having people you love to spend your life with as you go through the ups and downs. The proposal and wedding scenes gave me all the teary-eyed feels.Lovely soundtrack.Keep watching to the very end of the final rolling credits to see one last, touching video clip of the real people featured in this movie.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:Some might think the film is a little too heavy-handed and manipulative. Maybe, but I didn't mind at all.TIPS FOR PARENTS:The movie will inspire you AND your kids. It's great to see a movie that you can watch together with your family.An unmarried couple lives together for a time.THEMES:CourageThe ability to be steady amidst adversityPersistenceWhile this isn't a typical Christian movie, faith was a large part of the story: faith in God and faith in one's selfPatienceYou can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom Youtube channel.~trinaboice rated 10/10 on 11 February 2022", So inspiring!: Such inspiring movie!

It is wordy with a lot of talk and not a whole lot of baseball, which may be a disappointment for fans, but to me that was not a bad thing at all. It saw a different side to the sport and how sports films are approached and portrayed, and it was done wonderfully, apart from a couple of scenes that were a touch too talky.'Moneyball' is a very well made film, not one of the most visually beautiful films of the year but still beautifully shot and the scenery is very handsome. Bennett Miller does a fine job directing, keeping the film engrossing and the drama alert and easy to follow. The music complements very nicely, never over-bearing or too low-key.Aaron Sorkin's script is smart and intelligent, filled with humour and heart, while the storytelling is well paced and enthralling, managing to make something exciting out of a potentially dry subject matter or a film that could have suffered from sluggish execution in lesser hands.Brad Pitt's lead performance is full of daring enthusiasm and he wins one over with his charisma. In contrast, Jonah Hill is superbly understated and Philip Seymour Hoffmann steals every scene he's in.Overall, a great film that is more than just a film about baseball. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 30 November 2016"," Baseball by the numbers: Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics, a team that rose to notoriety because of its low payroll and unorthodox player selection. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manage, grows tired with the ancient, inefficient ways of the game he has committed his entire life to. When a transaction goes awry he stumbles across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale, economics graduate who believes he has a system to rating players based on numbers.Billy and Peter begin trading, signing, and grooming the team based on data, not scouting, something that other members of the team are not fond of, including Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the team's manager. Billy and Peter's system defies current baseball logic, but when the club starts to win games with players like Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop), and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), the eyes of the country turn to Oakland, where only seeing is believing.What happened in Oakland back in '02 was incredible. It shouldn't have happened if you ask the right people, and other people will tell you it means nothing. Well, it did mean something it has changed the way people think about the game for good. You couldn't just go out and look at a kid to see if he would be a star or not. There were more stats to consider than home runs, strikeouts, and batting average. The game was expanding and becoming more and more a battle of logic.The film's structure is centered mostly on Billy Beane, but the most exciting parts for me were about the system. Writer Aaron Sorkin, who a few months back accepted a slew of awards for his screenplay The Social Network, tosses out jargon that baseball fanatics go crazy for. For the general audience, that's where Billy helps out. Peter explains the system and has to break it down more for Beane (i.e. the audience) so everybody on screen and in the seats is on the same page.Pitt's portrayal of Beane won me over. He completely caught me off guard. I know Pitt can act but I remember him for performances that were very complex on the outside. Aldo Raine (Inglourious Basterds) with his pronounces chin, squinty eyes, and thick accent. Benjamin Button (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) who grew younger as he got older. Jeffrey Goines (12 Monkeys) who couldn't sit still let alone focus on one subject in a conversation. Yes, he was nominated for all these performances, but in a performance like this there is something bubbling under the surface. All of his characters to an extent have something going on underneath, only this character, Billy Beane, is so normal and calm on the outside, yet when he is alone we can see pain and frustration.His supporting cast of Hill, Hoffman, and the slew of ball players and colleagues, help turn this baseball team into the world of Oakland Athletics. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior. Hill is quiet, timid, and very smart. Hoffman is cold, weathered, and stubborn. Pitt is able to play off of both temperaments and make their scenes together pop off the screen.The one thing that this movie has going for it is the lack of actual action on the diamond. There are some great scenes of actual baseball, one at bat by Hatteberg in particular struck a chord with me, but for the most part the action is behind the scenes. There is enough for a sports junkie to get their fix and enough drama and with Beane and his family to entice any average viewer into the theater. I can't think of many target groups that wouldn't find it interesting, except for children, due to language and complexity of some of the dialogue. All in all this is one movie that will please a lot of people, and more importantly a lot of different people, sort of like The Blind Side, only the movie is actually really good.~moviemanMA rated 9/10 on 24 September 2011"," More than a game of numbers: It has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in ""Moneyball"" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.It's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of ""Moneyball"" starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary. A lot of people took offense to Beane's approach of degrading players down to the sum total of their on-base percentage and runs-in potential. But I liked it. Since the game of baseball isn't changing any time soon and players will always just be elements that can help win games and make more money, why not view them as numbers rather than as people with ugly girlfriends? Like Peter Brand, I like numbers. It's a movie about doing more with less, so I think we're just supposed to ignore the irony that they needed an excessively high budget to make it. In fact, it cost Sony Pictures more money to make this movie than it cost the Oakland A's to field their entire team for a season. Oh well, only one lesson for Hollywood at a time, and I still liked the movie.For a movie about people trying to change the game of baseball, it's only fitting that they are changing the sports genre. This isn't about the team and how many games they're going to win. As in all cases, they win some and they lose some. And we really only meet one player, the rest are just names thrown in the air. The movie is about Billy Beane, a real person, and a multi-dimensional character. At first he realizes that he is going to have to play the game with more than just money, and then after he makes it about numbers too, he finds a balanced statistical and personal concept.""Moneyball"" says that the game is about money, but the movie is about people. Writer Aaron Sorkin knows how to write people, and as evidenced by ""The Social Network"" (2010), he also knows how to turn computer-programming into riveting cinema. We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball"" gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers.~napierslogs rated 9/10 on 1 October 2011"," Intriguing, investing, with a great screenplay and a fantastic performance at its core: Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and don't see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. It's his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one can't seem to hope for an 'experimental' sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of 'field' action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films.~Red_Identity rated NA on 15 November 2011"," Moneyball isn't focussed on just playing Baseball but instead the inner workings of building the greatest team.: Hundreds of sports films, hundreds of them. Pretty sure Hollywood has tackled every type of sport, including Baseball several times over. Why should this one be any different? Well, this is the true story of the Oakland Athletics to which their General Manager at the time used a new technique of deciding a team: the Moneyball model. Using statistics and logic to pick the most effective players at the cheapest price, therefore building the ultimate economical team. Such a model could change the Baseball industry and negate years of traditional intuition. This is not so much about changing Baseball, but a personal journey for Billy Beane. He himself was chosen to play professionally, ditching his chances of further education. It didn't work out, and so he desired to change the system and defy the industry as a personal vendetta against them. Completely unconventional, having a computer system pick the most suitable players as opposed to listening to veterans who have something that algorithms do not: experience. Thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can say I have no interest in Baseball (not particularly huge in the UK). A screenplay by Aaron Sorkin was destined to keep me captivated. Every script he writes is filled with sharp, concise dialogue that keeps you hooked on the characters. Brad Pitt looked effortlessly natural, owned every scene he was in. Jonah Hill...get ready guys...I actually liked. Finally!? A film I like him in. Cool, calm and calculated, was perfect at playing a graduate economist. Bennett Miller's direction was clean with a great mixture of old footage of Baseball games with the reconstructed acting. There's a scene towards the end where the result of a game relies on Chris Pratt hitting the ball. When he does...silence. I felt the tingles, was beautifully executed. Whilst the sport of Baseball does not interest me in the slightest, I loved the focus on the team building and thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone.~TheMovieDiorama rated 8/10 on 28 February 2018"," I don't like baseball. I don't like math. However, I still liked Moneyball.: I don't like baseball. I don't like math. However, I still liked Moneyball. They could have easily shaved off a half-hour from this film and it's completely inaccessible for those who don't have a fundamental understanding of baseball, but it has solid writing, solid acting and even though it's primarily a crash course in statistics, it's still interesting.~cricketbat rated 6/10 on 20 July 2018"," A high quality crowd pleaser: America's pastime has returned to the big screen and it is more witty and elegant than ever. Moneyball is the inspiring story of the Oakland A's, a team that was all but bankrupt but managed to beat the odds through intelligence and perseverance. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the team's general manager who has run out of ideas on how to make his strapped for cash team successful. This is until he meets Pete Brand, played by Jonah Hill, an economic major from Yale. Brand devises a formula that analyzes players in a way nobody else does, thus revealing statistics about players that no one else can see. Beane and Brand use this formula to build up their unlikely roster of misfits. The themes of this film run deep through our aspiring minds. It's a film about beating the odds, going against the current, and standing up for what you believe is right. It is a moving and inspiring film that really only uses baseball as a backdrop for its deeper and more universal themes. It's a moving film and you don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.The strongest element of Moneyball is easily Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian's incredibly sharp script. Moneyball brings up fond memories of 2010's The Social Network in which Sorkin pulled out all the stops in his intellectual screen writing ability. The dialogue in Moneyball moves at the same pace as any Sorkin or Zaillian script does. It has a driving cadence to it that keeps a film entirely dominated by dialogue very exciting and entertaining. Their script is lively, energetic, and diverse. Moneyball has intensely emotional scenes that compel and inspire, but then it has its lighthearted and much funnier moments that have the exact same affect. There's a lot to be said for any film that has the capability to make its audience laugh and cry in the same two hour span. Moneyball is a film like that and it all begins at Sorkin's fantastic script.However, it is helped by the film's superb cast. Brad Pitt leads the film perfectly, creating a very interesting protagonist and driving the film in a way few leads can. He attacks his role as Billy Beane with the utmost care, respect, and sincerity. Despite all of Pitt's good looks and always recognizable celebrity face, you will have a hard time remembering that Pitt is the one acting, not Billy Beane. But, as always, where would such a strong lead be without his supporting cast? Moneyball has that supporting cast, and it finds its immeasurable talent in the most unlikely of places. I'm talking, of course, about Jonah Hill. Hill has built his career on being a comedy caricature with over the top flicks such as Superbad and Get Him to the Greek. But all that changes when Hill takes on the role of Pete Brand. His performance is stellar. He proves himself to be a true up and comer who won't find himself restricted within the confines of teen comedy.Overall, Moneyball is your typical crowd pleaser, but it is incredibly high quality. It is so well directed, so superbly acted, and Sorkin and Zaillian's script is practically flawless. Personally this isn't the film I will go crazy about. Rather, it is a film that I will enjoy so sincerely and with all my heart. I really did love this film and my respect for it is eternal. It may be typical and straightforward in its overall themes, but the quality of the film outshines this. Moneyball is just an excellent film.~KnightsofNi11 rated 8/10 on 2 October 2011"," I Don't Even Like Baseball: I hate sports, I really do but I love movies and this one peaked my interest and I decided to watch it and I was thoroughly impressed by what I saw. The filmmakers To a really good job of making you care about the success of The Oakland Athletics because they take the time to show you just how bad a state they are in. They also take the time to build the characters so that you understand how important it is for them to succeed. Brad Pitt was fantastic in this film not only did he have some really great one liners but he had a great heart to him you felt sorry for him through seeing his last failings and I really loved his chemistry with Jonah Hill who was also great in this film up until The Wolf of Wall Street this was his best performance ever, I loved his character because he was easy to relate to, that new kid quality does that and I thought Hill did a great job with some of the more emotional scenes. The baseball scenes are filmed terrifically there done in a very documentation style which makes them feel more life like. The relationship between Pitt and his daughter was a really nice touch it made you care more about him and gave you a sense of who he was as a person not just a manager. I liked the fact that they made this film feel real, you completely understand how bad the odds are against this new system, you see them be put down, get angry at defeats and face dismissal and it makes you care all the more about this team succeeding. The late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie and he did a great job, I really liked his character he didn't agree with this system and it let you get the series of events from the players perspective and added a more personal touch to the games. I do have a few flaws with this film, for one Chris Pratts character was very wasted, at first it seemed as if they were setting up a good arc for his character but they don't give it the time required to make you care and just ends up being unnecessary. I also thought that they should have taken the time to see the teams success instead of simply shown it in a montage as it didn't give the victories any emotional weight and was an unsatisfactory conclusion to such a good story arc. Despite hating sports I really enjoyed this movie, I loved Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, you really got invested in the characters and the team and the sporting sequences themselves were very well done. 84%/A-~cdjh-81125 rated 8/10 on 26 November 2016"," Who thought Baseball and Economics would make an interesting movie?: ¨There are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's fifty-feet of crap, and then there's us. ¨ Moneyball was among the best films I've seen this year. It really caught me by surprise since I'm not a big baseball fan and wasn't expecting much considering the subject matter. Baseball and economics seemed like a bad combination for me, but since Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were all starring in this film I had to see it. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Billy Beane character and the relationship he had with his young assistant Peter Brand. They are really the center of this movie so if you're doubting wither or not you should see this worrying about the subject matter all I can say is go see it anyways because it is much more than simply another baseball movie. There are some very strong and emotional scenes where I couldn't help but get goose bumps over a team and a sport I really didn't care for. That is how good this film is. Moneyball is directed by Bennett Miller, who also directed Capote in which Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his lead performance as Truman Capote. Miller has proved he can make some great films. The movie was adapted from the book written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) which focuses on the true story of the Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane, who managed to put together the 2002 team on a very low budget by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players based on a formula which was perfected by his young assistant. This would change the game forever. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network and Charlie Wilson's War) did a great job at adapting the screenplay for the big screen.The movie begins with real footage from the last 2001 divisional series game between the Yankees and the A's. The A's were winning the series two games to nothing, but the Yankees came back to win the final three games and leave the A's out of the Championship Divisional game for a second year in a row. The bad news for General Manager, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is that he's going to lose his three star players for the next season. The A's don't have the kind of budget that other rich teams like the Red Sox or the Yankees have. It's just impossible to compete against those teams, so it's time to think outside the box. Billy meets with his talent scouts to see how they can replace these key players without any money, but finds no solution. He decides to hire a young Yale Economic graduate who was working as an adviser for the Cleveland Indians. His name is Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and he uses statistical data to analyze each player and decide which one has a better value based on their batting average and price. Beane and Brand go against all odds and decide to build their team entirely on these computer statistics. The scouts are outraged by the decision, but Beane believes this is the only way he can compete with the big budget teams. Beane also has some arguments with manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) over whom he should start, but the main focus of the film relies on the relationship between Beane and Brand. There are also a few scenes dealing with Beane and his relationship with his young daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) who lives with her mom Sharon (Robin Wright) in California as well.Moneyball works as both a sports film and a biographical movie, but it is really much more than that. It works thanks to a very strong performance from both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill who shine in every scene they are together in. Since Beane doesn't like to watch the games for fear of jinxing the team we don't really get to see a lot of baseball. There are several conversations revolving around baseball, but it really isn't that central to the film. The true heart of the film is Beane who we all want to see succeed and silence the critics. We want his system to work because he is such a charismatic character and he believes in what he is doing. The scene where the streak begins is very inspiring and one of the best moments in sports film in my opinion. I really got a lot of goose bumps during that twentieth game winning streak. I also enjoyed the side story revolving around Billy and his daughter Casey. Kerris Dorsey has little screen time, but she is great opposite Brad Pitt. As for Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright they really don't have much to work with and don't bring anything to the story really. It's a shame because Hoffman is a great actor and he could've had a better role in this film. In my opinion the ending is perfect as well and the soundtrack was also great. Moneyball was one of the most emotional experiences I've had with a movie all year and I really recommend this inspiring film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/~estebangonzalez10 rated 10/10 on 9 January 2012"," Pitt is at the top of his game: I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before its national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former major leaguer turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After losing in the playoffs to the Yankees, the A's lose their stars to free agency. Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition. While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman—or at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job—frustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team.~Legendary_Badass rated 9/10 on 21 September 2011"
Rush (2013) - IMDb,8.1,Daniel Brühl|Chris Hemsworth|Olivia Wilde|Alexandra Maria Lara|Pierfrancesco Favino|David Calder|Natalie Dormer|Stephen Mangan|Christian McKay|Alistair Petrie|Julian Rhind-Tutt|Colin Stinton|Jamie de Courcey|Augusto Dallara|Ilario Calvo|Patrick Baladi|Vincent Riotta|Martin Savage,Ron Howard,Peter Morgan,The merciless 1970s rivalry between Formula One rivals James Hunt and Niki Lauda.," Was really surprised by how good this was: Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s. 'Rush' did seem intriguing, Ron Howard has done some good work in the past and my sister and her boyfriend absolutely raving about it. However having no knowledge of auto racing and having never found it my cup of tea there was a touch of intrepidation. As well as the worry as to whether there was going to be any bias and whether it was going to stray from the facts. After watching 'Rush', this viewer is so glad that she gave it a chance because it was a gripping and entertaining film from start to finish, and quite easily Howard's best work in some time.Some occasional rushed pacing and some weak dialogue, that lacked flow, sounded awkward and stuck out like a sore thumb against everything else that was done to such a professional level, were the only drawbacks to overall one of 2013's better films. The time period is very evocatively depicted, there is a real sense of time and place, there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout, the editing is slick, clever and gives the race scenes the thrills they need and the photography is similarly audaciously slick and like the cinematographer was part of the action itself, especially good in the climactic Japanese race sequence. Hans Zimmer's score is not his best work by all means, but it went with the racing theme remarkably well and does capture the mid-70s time period and the atmosphere of the sport to such great effect (again the final race in Japan stood out). The sound effects also help, having a real authenticity.For a film about auto racing, one does have to talk about how 'Rush' deals with the race sequences. The good news is that they are absolutely thrilling and keeps one to the edge of their seat, while all of them are brilliantly done, showing how glamorous and also dangerous the sport is (not many sports films I've seen have properly and fully captured the spirit of the sport it's portraying in the way Rush did) the highlight is the climactic Japanese race, which was both exhilarating and moving (masterful if having to sum it up in one word). Howard not only depicts the mid- 70s as if the viewer were transported back in time and part of the period (such was the evocativeness of the atmosphere) and adopts a visual style that never looks cheap and as said like the cinematographer was there part of the action, but he shows here that he knows how to tell a story. The storytelling is always compelling, thoughtful, informative and thrilling with a surprising amount of emotional impact, found myself really identifying with Lauda.The film is faithful to the facts, the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is genuinely engaging and are shown a lot of respect and dimension here. Neirher Hunt or Lauda are one-dimensional here and, although Lauda is the more sympathetically drawn of the two, one does not takes sides with one or the other. It also is tightly paced and assured, never getting bogged down in too much back story, too much soap- opera, too much sentimentality or technical jargon/minutiae (that would likely have gone over the heads of first-time viewers or non-fans of the sport). All the supporting performances are well-done, though some with not much to do, with Olivia Wilde and Christian McKay faring the strongest. It is however the two leads that carry 'Rush' cast wise, both of them as close to perfect as one can get. Daniel Brühl gives Niki Lauda a real brooding intensity and genuine poignancy, making it very easy to feel sorry for him, while swaggering Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Hunt.All in all, a gripping and hugely entertaining film. Has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by the number of things 'Rush' does right. 9/10 Bethany Cox~TheLittleSongbird rated 9/10 on 10 March 2016"," Bound to win Academy Award nominations - and rightly so: In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally life-and-death struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Frost/Nixon"") and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of ""Frost/Nixon"") have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.Sensibly the car racing does not over-dominate, since this is essentially a character- driven conflict, but when the racing is on screen - notably in the final race - the excitement is visceral. The Australian Chris Hemsworth (previously best known as ""Thor"") and the Spanish-born German Daniel Brühl (""Inglourious Basterds"") are so good as the British and Austrian drivers respectively that the dialect coaches should receive a special commendation. Arguably Brühl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career.A great strength of this tale is that there is not a hero or a villain. Both drivers had privileged backgrounds and were superbly talented, but both were flawed. although in very contrasting ways, including styles of thinking, driving and womanising (Olivia Wilde as model Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as aristocratic Marlene Knaus respectively).I never saw the recent film ""Senna"" (2010) so ""Rush"" reminded me most of the much older ""Grand Prix"" (1966), but what is stunning about ""Rush"" is that it all happened. A season of the fastest sport in the world decided in the last race by one point - you couldn't make it up. Rush to see the movie.~rogerdarlington rated NA on 15 September 2013"," Thrilling character study: As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these ""coffins on wheels"", every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.~tomgillespie2002 rated 8/10 on 19 January 2014", A super cool movie: A super cool movie Beautiful story and wonderful acting main actors~auuwws rated 9/10 on 3 June 2020," A Gripping, Adrenaline-Ridden Fuel Ride From Howard: Just come out the cinema in York from watching Rush! Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.~CalRhys rated NA on 28 September 2013"," What's This? A Ron Howard Movie That Isn't Intolerable?: I never thought I would ever watch a Ron Howard movie again much less write a good review of one.Howard hasn't made a movie since ""Parenthood"" that has not bored me to tears and almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal to take any risks. He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.However, the great reviews of ""Rush"" and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.Grade: A-~evanston_dad rated 8/10 on 8 May 2014"," F1 finally has an amazing film: This is an amazing film. I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.Do yourself a favour and see it now.~bm2759 rated 10/10 on 16 September 2013"," Quite good.: I enjoyed ""Rush"", as have a ton of other people. As of today, it's #142 on IMDb and it was nominated for Best Picture. While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.I was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films ""Le Mans"" and ""Grand Prix""--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly ""Le Mans""). However, both films were a bit light on plot. ""Rush"", on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.The acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.PLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids.~planktonrules rated 7/10 on 12 March 2014"," The best movie this year so far!: Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human nature, love and tears.It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don't know how they did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable.It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush is that good meal, it's a fun ride!I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron Howard for making this masterpiece.~joechang-1 rated 10/10 on 13 September 2013"," No better script than reality: Originally I planned on not watching ""Rush"" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Brühl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course, it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was not even born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Brühl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in ""Inglourious Basterds"" where his performance wouldn't make my top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.While Brühl kinda sways between lead and supporting territory, the movie's clear lead is Chris Hemsworth as Lauda's equally talented competitor James Hunt. In fact, he is around 5 years younger than Brühl, but his character is slightly older. I believe Hemsworth made a couple smart career choices recently and, after thoroughly enjoying the first Thor movie, I'm pretty curious about the second, which comes out soon. His character here is a bon vivant who loves drinks, ladies and the sweet life, the polar opposite to Lauda's stubborn lone wolf. And these exact opposites are the basis of the film, the reason why it works so well as an intriguing character study of two extremes clashing. Their personalities also reflect directly on the women with them. While Olivia Wilde as Hunt's wife disappears almost as quickly as she entered the picture, Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's wife stays there till the end and we see a good portrayal from her as somebody who's attracted to the danger (their first meeting in the civilian's car), but at the same time constantly worried about her husband's well-being and powerless as she can do nothing but hope for the best.All in all, I recommend this film a lot. Really, you don't have to know anything about Formula One or racing in general in order to enjoy it for being a great character study. I haven't seen a full race either in maybe a bit less than ten years and it still felt like a compelling watch. The motorsports circus is really just the stage for the two protagonists and except very close to the end there's not that much racing action included anyway. And when there is, it always comes with an impact on the relationship between the two. But even if it's just the stage, all the scenes at the race tracks were executed very convincingly and I never thought that it's all just make-believe. They also managed to convey the aura of the Formula One from the 1970s that has sadly lost a lot of its charm by now. Howard knew that he had to make a film that appeals to the masses and Formula 1, compared to NASCAR, Indy 500 etc., has never been a sport that created too much interest in North America, which is why you don't really find American drivers participating that often either. He managed very nicely and it's a great example of a rivalry that pushed each of the rivals to the limit, often in a good way, and occasionally beyond. What I also liked about it is that it definitely ends on a positive note, possibly with the best scene of the movie with Hunt and Lauda meeting at the hangar, which sums up their relationship perfectly. Subtle criticism for the other's lifestyle, occasional mindgames, but also respect. It's always nice to go out in style as we usually tend to remember the ending more than everything that was before and, if badly executed, it can hurt the film's overall perception a lot. Not so here. Very well done as almost the entire rest of the movie. With this character clash, screenwriter Peter Morgan succeeds at least as much as with the one in Frost/Nixon.~Horst_In_Translation rated 8/10 on 11 October 2013"

Why? Well, the movie's synopsis just has that to it, the concept of the storyline here it just is something that you can't help to take to heart.And I will say that writers Mark Rizzo, Javier Fesser and David Marqués didn't disappoint. The script for the movie was every bit as entertaining as it was heartwarming and beautiful. I was genuinely entertained by this movie from start to end. Sure, it was predictable, but the storyline just worked on many levels.And the cast ensemble in the movie was good. Of course I was familiar with the likes of Woody Harrelson, Kaitlin Olson, Cheech Marin and Ernie Hudson. But the movie definitely had a lot of other good acting performances to it. All members of The Friends basketball team here were putting on some rather real and lovable performances.If you can't enjoy a movie such as ""Champions"", then I don't really know what to say. I warmly recommend you to watch ""Champions"", especially if you enjoy a movie that sinks right in and sits with you for some time. This is definitely a feel-good movie.My rating of ""Champions"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.~paul_haakonsen rated 7/10 on 31 March 2023"," As a retired SPED teacher, loved the realness!: As my title states, I am a retired high school SPED teacher and I was also a Special Olympics coach for several years in different sports. When I read an interview with Woody Harrelson about this movie, I was intrigued to see it because I wanted to see how Hollywood would portray these very real people with intellectual disabilities.While there are certainly and understandably elements of Hollywood in this movie, the realness of the Friends team was very authentic. And all throughout the movie it's the authenticity of the Friends team that makes this such an enjoyable movie. Personally, I thought it was just a bit too long, but that aside, I just kept saying to myself, ""Yes, that is exactly what probably would happen in that situation."" The absolute clincher of this was at the very end of the championship game and the team's reaction to the final shot. I promise you, that was very realistic. I've seen that play out in my classroom and in the field or court dozens of times. So, I hope many will watch this movie and enjoy these folks for who they really are, warts and all. Isn't that really what we all want?~aumufan24 rated 8/10 on 14 March 2023"," Feel Good at its best: Comedy, Drama, Heart Warming. This film ticks all the boxes. Has you laughing, has you cheering, has you annoyed and gets you gripped.Managed to get to an advance screening of this with my 11 year old boy and we were both unsure of what we was about to watch, was it a comedy, was it an underdog story, was it a drama, was it a sports film and we were both amazed at what was a well spent hour and half. It was all of the above. We laughed, we teared up, we were engrossed in it all. The acting is superb the jokes are both laugh out loud and chuckle to yourself. You love the characters at times you hate them at times and you enjoy the ride.It's not going to win any Oscars and it's not going to get rave reviews but if you want to escape from the troubles of life and have a damn good time you can't go wrong with seeing this.Oh, and Woody plays the role perfectly.~milts-22133 rated 8/10 on 10 March 2023"," A film with genuine heart and humor: Another sports comedy film I thought to myself, well, was I pleasantly surprised how enjoyable this little gem was. It actually had many laugh out loud moments, even a few rolling on the floor laughing moments, but it also had tons of heartwarming moments. Literally all casting and performances were spot on, and kudos to Harrelson for the excellent portrayal of his character. The directing was on point, but the writing had some dragged out scenes that made the 124 min runtime feel much longer. A faster pace and/or some scene trimming would've gone a long way, but nevertheless, the story had great cohesion and flow to it. If you're looking for a movie that will tear you up - both through humor and heart, this is a must see. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.~Top_Dawg_Critic rated 8/10 on 24 March 2023"," Great feel good film: Champions follows the tried and tested formula for most underdog sports movies, offering a nice reminder of how fun and enjoyable it is to watch a great feel good film that's jokes mostly land and uses it's accessible nature to inform and educate as well as entertain.After a few years of supporting performances, it's great to see Woody Harrelson back in a lead role, flawed but still likeable and always charming. Kaitlin Olson thankfully isn't wasted and gets plenty of screen time and depth.However, the films strongest aspect is the friends (and title characters) themselves, always a joy to watch and the film wisely gives them to time to shine on their own a few times, proving they're just as funny and talented.Robert Farrelly swaps genres just as well as his brother did with 2018's Green Book, balancing the humour and heartfelt moments really well, keeping the film moving at a nice place with a fair few montages and plenty of needle drops (maybe too many) to make it more enjoyable.~masonsaul rated 8/10 on 14 March 2023", I have autism and I loved this movie! I wish Bobby Farrelly would hire me!: My experience was mostly superb except had a slightly creepy guy named Ralph stare at me and talk to me afterwards that might've been innocent but was uncomfortable interaction I'm sure if it there wasn't cameras/public hallway something weird might've happened or maybe I'm entirely wrong I couldn't tell. Anyways about the movie absolutely loved it a lot especially the friends group I'd love to be part of they're group autistic folks don't have enough opportunities at least in my experience I don't. Champions is so wonderful sorry for my mixed review the movie is definitely spectacular very heartwarming and unique all around. Woody Harrelson is a gem of great being that deserves a lot of praise.~UniqueParticle rated 9/10 on 16 March 2023," Good guys don't leave.: Hot headed basketball coach Marcus Marakovich loses his job after lashing out at his boss, instead of a prison sentence, he's ordered to do community service, and coach a basketball team, with learning disabilities.This is a magical, funny, wonderful, heart warming movie, it's super funny, it's one that tugs at the heart strings, it's genuinely a film I didn't want to end.It's an underdog story in a sense, it's a film that proves that anyone can do anything. Marcus is a bit of a dinosaur, it's his journey that makes this such an utterly engrossing watch.The Friends..... I loved each and every one of them, what a fabulous, talented bunch of individuals they are, I hope I get to see more of these guys in many more films, brilliant all round.Woody Harrelson, he's one of my all time favourites, he never disappoints, as always he's a joy, he's funny, he's natural, he's awesome.Sublime. .....but I still don't understand curling.10/10.~Sleepin_Dragon rated 10/10 on 27 October 2023"," A Champion For Feel Good Antics/Characters: LIKES:Pacing Is Great:-The movie may move a tad fast at times, but at 2 hours it actually respects the story and grants you this incredibly fun and heartfelt story with good focus.-It gives you plenty of jokes and builds on the relationships of the coach with the players, while also building things up and in a manner does it justice-Yet, it never lost the entertainment piece for me and that was a strong victory to have these two elements work well, to the point that I seldom looked at my phone to judge the time.-And to do it all in one movie, well... that's sometimes rarer than diamonds in my opinion.Handles The Sensitive Content Well-This is a movie about players with mental challenges and obstacles, so there is going to be some sensitive material that may rub people the wrong way.-Some trigger words, stereotypes, and lives are examined in this and you'll find that keeping to this movie, you start to see this content shine in a light that really is amazing to see.-How they interact, jobs, lives, and attitudes are all beautifully portrayed in this movie for me, but never dives too much into the cheese factor or essentially muddies the character in my opinion.-Throw in the use of the low points in the story and helping them move towards progressing the plot, and once again you get this amazing opportunity to see this world come to life in a very amazing way.-And to also not be too in your face with the topic, well... I have to say that was the biggest victory for me, again having the Disney aware speeches, but also not so much to be insulted or turned away, just like the 90s did a long time ago.Story Was Laid Out and Planned-I've said this many times, but the stories these days are either simplified, or take too many shortcuts to shove everything in.-But Champions goes back to having a story laid out, having some organic layers to it, and doing their best to integrate it all in a logical moment.-Seeing how he enacts the help of people, seeing how the players sort of evolve, and even more seeing the challenges are all logical, timed well, and resolved with very interesting methods that work both emotionally and comedically.-And seeing how these all just build into this odd and quirky family really was so much fun and enjoyable to me, but never losing the evolution that the coach had with these people and more so the incredible level of building they had.Acting Is Great-The movie is again nothing that is going to blow your mind with the most masterful performances, but that doesn't mean it's not great for this reviewer-Champions starts with Harrelson, and he is such a strong pillar where his personality really meshes well with the content at hand.-A vagabond character where sarcasm, snarky comments, and him being just Harrelson, this character allowed him to explore a little more of the acting spectrum and utilize his talents to a more engaging level. It's fun, enjoyable and again motivating and may have been one of my favorite roles in a long time of this man.-Olson is energetic and a good counter piece to the mix. She has a bit more of the goofiness in the role, but as the movie progresses, the writers honed the character's qualities in and grant you this fun leading lady that added, not took away, from the plot and what she did for the characters.-Matt Cook is more of the comedic relief, but he does it well, and still adds this touch of sentimental sides that maybe needed a little more time to be perfect, but still was much welcomed by my review and what he did.-And the players themselves were on point, each one adding some level of engagement to the mix, making the movie fun, and yet never feeling insulted or faked out. That authenticity with acting really adds the spark to ignite that family dynamic.The Comedy Is Very Well Done/Timed-This movie has lots of jokes and styles that will be amazing to enjoy on levels.-Those with relevant experiences will capitalize the most from this movie, finding the antics of Johnny and the crew to be so relevant and familiar that you can't help but find it funny.-And there is variety and timing that help further enhance the experience. Champions isn't just shoving stereotypes and insults in your face. No, it's smarter than that, and again uses simple timing, delivery, and character engagements to do the heavy lifting.-With the variety of factors, and the natural feel, that comedic experience is just enjoyable to fans like me and so worth the investment.Inspirational-Yeah, you know this movie is going to be like this, and I'm happy it delivered so much and in some ways unexpected results that really added this fun atmosphere to the movie.-The dialogue does the work, the nuances with music and filming, and then adding this engaging level to all the character development builds upon the story they want to tell.-And then it just comes together at the end in a way that feels exactly how one processes these things that takes a realistic, and yet poetic tone.-This component may add a tad more time to the movie, but trust me, it actually works with the themes of the movie, at least for me.The End Credits-It's fun, fitting, and just full of the energy of the movie even though it pretty much adds nothing to the story.-Champions credits are for those that just like to have fun, enjoy good music, and bring this family vibe back in one last moment, for an encore that works. Oh, and you don't have to stay until the end... it's more like a deleted scene component that you can check out later.DISLIKES:Some Jokes Go a Tad Too Far-There are some running jokes that aren't my cup of tea, but get hammered a bit too much-They are actually few and far between, but that repetition doesn't do much for me when it comes and sometimes a bit awkwardly forced in that didn't hit the engines for me.-But again, there is more good content in this movie that it really offsets this dislike to me for the most part.Predictable:-The movie has a twist and it does work, but it doesn't mean this movie quite stands out from the other sports movies that came before it.-There are maybe two moments that get a surprise moment, but, it's a rather straight forward story that is going to most likely turn people away from this movie at the trailers.-It's a fair point, but the journey is the fun factor to this film and think it again helps mitigate the simplistic tale we have going.Some Tough Starts You'll Have To Get Through A Bit-In a sensitive topic like this, you know there are going to be jokes and content presented that can be hard to watch.-Champions has a patchy start, but if you can make it past the material that shows the toxic world that begins this movie, you should be good to go for a great journey.-That being said, there will be some trigger words, some behaviors, and maybe a tad insulting/sensitive stepping, but I implore you to stick with it and you'll get one of the more fun movies of the year in a long time.The Basketball Moments Need Some Work-Hollywood makes some of the best sports moments, adding great music and makeup to the court to really give these engaging moments.-It might be a realistic approach, and it might be true to the material, but, I won't like I wanted a bit more magic to the moment, which we kind of get to the end of the movie.-And maybe adding some music, some coordination, and not rushing through the games as much as they do would have done that.-The montage even feels a tad bland, and while there are funny moments, there are still other movies that do the magic better to bring out the full movie moments that I like in my sports films like Remember The Titans and The Big Green.The Verdict:Champions turns out to be one of the biggest surprises by how much this movie does well in the grand scheme of things. This is no watered down, charity movie, no, it's a film that's got some bite, a lot of charm, and this engaging components that just really works overall. The film handles a sensitive topic well, with a pace and antics that make the film just fun to watch across the board and get a bit inspirational components in the mix. A pace that is engaging, characters that have buildup, great respect of the story, and an atmosphere that is just super fun to enjoy, this movie really did surprise me by how much I liked it. Sure, it still doesn't have the spark of originality, and some things are a tad rough in terms of jokes and terminology. But it's really only the basketball scenes I needed a little more tweaking the most to round out this film. Still, it's a feel good movie to check out in theaters for the sake of just a group movie and if you don't get a chance, check it out at home if you get a chance.My scores are:Comedy/Drama/Sport: 8.0-8.5Movie Overall: 7.5.~rgkarim rated 8/10 on 12 March 2023"," Enjoyable heart warming tale of Connection: My Review-ChampionsMy Rating. 7:10Champions was a really pleasant surprise and very entertaining as I know nothing about basket ball beyond the Harlem Globetrotters and that catchy tune.It's a familiar plot about a former disgraced baseball coach Marcus beautifully cast with Woody Harrelson in the lead resurrecting his career and self esteem.Marcus after being charged with a drink driving charge is assigned to community service coaching a team of intellectually disadvantaged players.Coach Marcus soon realises that this team simply called The Friends shows promise and his aloof rough tough exterior and ego soon begins to thaw .Especially when the infectious personalities and warmth of this team simply named The Friends convinces him to take them further perhaps even to Special Olympic status .Marcus also embarks on a casual romantic interest in one of the team members Johnny's sister Alex played delightfully by Kaitlin Olson .This relationship contributes to both Alex and Marcus having to face some soul searching truths about each other and the direction their lives are heading .Apart from Woody Harrelson and Kaitlin Olsen the most enjoyable aspect of this movie are the team members a talented group of young intellectually challenged young people.Standout performance by Madison Tevlin as the feisty female member Cosentino , Kevin Iannucci as Johnny the brother of Alex a wisecracking teen who is adored and protected by his sister.Also Matt Cook as Sonny who shows Marcus the value of friendship and Casey Metcalfe as Marlon the autistic savant who can rattle of amazing facts about any subject to the amazement of Marcus.This is a delightful if predictable story of hope and connection adapted from a 2018 Spanish film titled Campeones which I must try and track down the screenplay writers and director Bobby Farrelly have produced a very entertaining and thoughtful insight into the world of sport for intellectually disadvantaged people of all ages .~tm-sheehan rated 7/10 on 12 March 2023"

That scene alone makes this one of the more memorable comedies of the last 30 years. Almost everyone I know has either seen or heard of that scene and everyone laughs at it.It IS ludicrous and that's what makes it so funny. In fact, most of the movie is totally preposterous, totally unbelievable and totally wacky, which is Adam Sandler's trademark in these comedies. He's low key but violent, as he was in Mr. Deeds, Punch-Drunk Love and a few other films.Here, Sander is even more vocal and violent than normal and definitely more crude, which is saying something since this actor usually doesn't play guys with a lot of class. ""Happy"" is a hot-tempered hockey player who can hit a golf ball 400 yards so he tries his hand on the PGA tour to help raise money for his grandmother. I just shake my head even writing that last sentence, it sounds so stupid....but this is a stupid movie with an incredibly stupid story but is hilarious, for the most part.Anyone who is a golfer would appreciate this movie more than others, because Sandler says and does things we'd all like to do on the links at times but, thankfully, don't. In short: this is a crude but very funny movie.~ccthemovieman-1 rated 9/10 on 30 March 2006"," Violence, hockey, vulgarity ... all the good stuff!: My favorite Adam Sandler movie.I just think it aligns perfectly with his comic persona.

And she's way more mature than her old man is.It's not just the character of Happy Gilmore that's memorable here, but also Shooter McGavin, and Christopher McDonald deserves credit for making the entitled jackass a solid villain. Same for Carl Weathers, and you would think he'd be slumming it here, but he sure doesn't show it.Best of all? Out-of-Nowhere Bob Barker; secure enough in his celebrity to openly parody it with a free-for-all fistfight.Tell me ""The Price is Wrong, b***h!"" isn't one of Sandler's best lines.~Mr-Fusion rated 8/10 on 25 February 2019"," Apollo Creed with a wooden hand!! funny as hell: Adam Sandler has a very funny movie here that works like no other since Caddyshack.  Sandler plays a lazy guy who has to save his grandmother's house from being removed.  So, he starts to play golf in a way that only Sandler can.  He is also instructed by Carl Weathers (who memorably played Apollo Creed in Rokcy), and wathcing his scenes I had to leave the theater from laughing so much (he had a wooden hand and it always gets knocked off). Sandler knows how to keep people rolling in the ailes, and this proves it. A++~Quinoa1984 rated 7/10 on 30 April 2000"," Adam Sandler has never been a real favorite of the critics, but Happy Gilmore is undeniably one of his most successfully hilarious comedies.: In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film.There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here, as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green, and for the most part, this comedy scheme works pretty well here. Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression, clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. Indeed, some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go (`PIECE!! OF!! MONKEY *beep*!!'). So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things, but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face. Luckily for the movie and for its fans, this is not the most important element of a movie like this. It's not very likely that a slob like Happy, who doesn't make the hockey team, is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right, and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back. You would think that, having seen that he can make that much money, he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house. A noble cause, obviously, but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent. But who cares? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections. Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary, and there is clearly some overdone product placement, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film. Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film (although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2, when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing), and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified (although just barely) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts (or lack thereof) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing. As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments, Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are. They want fame and recognition, he wants money and beer (and Virginia, the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film).There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that, as much as I personally enjoy the movie, simply fall flat (many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie, or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament, or anything involving Chubbs' prosthetic hand) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to. Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character, despite all of his destructive habits, and the film is peppered with other notable performances, not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs, the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore, and Christopher MacDonald, in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin. Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler, which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here, so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected. Sandler does not make award-winning films, and chances are he never will, but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable. It is, to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up, a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema. It's a lot of fun, but there's no nutritional value.~Anonymous_Maxine rated 8/10 on 17 April 2002"," Turn off brain, watch movie, laugh, enjoy, laugh some more: ""Happy Gilmore"" is the Adam Sandler movie to see. If everyone had to see one Sandler movie before their lives were complete, I would seriously hope this is the movie they see. It's nice to see golf and hockey in a movie again. I don't think there is another movie out there that makes me laugh as much as ""Happy Gilmore"" does. You have Happy, the ultimate hero, fighting to win a life of security for his grandma. There's Shooter McGavin, the villain you love to hate, who attempts to foil Happy's quest. And then there's Mr. Larson, Happy's 8' tall monster of a former employer, threatening Shooter at every turn. Hey Bob Barker is in this movie! It doesn't get much funnier than Mr. Price Is Right insulting our hero. Well maybe Ben Stiller's part in this movie is funnier, as he corruptly directs a retirement home. It doesn't matter what's the funniest. This whole movie is one hilarious moment after another.~nucksfan4life rated 10/10 on 17 September 2002", The Price is Wrong Bob!: Ooooh the early days of Adam Sandler. He was gold back then and Happy Gilmore was perhaps his magnum opus.~view_and_review rated 8/10 on 16 July 2020," I say, We just lay by the bay and make hay! Okay?"": Okies....here we have the indisputable King of mediocrity but one thing you gotta say for Sandler - they don't come more unpretentious! He delivers what you expect and in HAPPY GILMORE he came up undeniably with his best film!As the wannabe hockey great in dire need of an anger-management course, Sandler discovers by chance his prodigious golfing talents - but using a hockey stick! In a performance best decribed as R-rated Jerry Lewis, Sandler is a hoot as he takes on Bob Barker, the establishment and Shooter McGavin - golfing's hissable ""Mr Smarm"" (An Oscar-worthy turn from Christopher McDonald)Carl Weathers turns in a blinder as Sandler's newly come-by coach with an unfortunate earlier run-in with a hungry croc! If you don't find anything in this film funny, you're a dead person! Like many devotees, we have watched this film countless times - it just improves with age!~uds3 rated NA on 28 August 2002"," Enjoyable Older Sandler film: Happy Gilmore is an early film of Adam Sandler's during his 1990's era. The spirit of the film and the title character played by Sandler are every bit as enjoyable as many have considered this film to be. Happy is the ultimate chip-on-his-shoulder leading man, who settles every argument with a punch in the nose or a biting wisecrack. He has a short fuse which is shown that the slightest spark can set him off, occasionally with great results. He is a lifelong hockey fan, and he wants desperately to play with the pros, but he has one problem which is he can't skate. However after one day occasionally fooling around with golf with a few friends, he is noticed by former gold legend Chubbs. From there on, Chubbs tells him that Happy is a great and has talent, though Happy doesn't want any part of golf since his goal is to become a hockey player. Happy Gilmore does have several decent laughs and Adam Sandler plays the character as needed. For a comedy the plot works well enough and the pacing is good. It isn't too long and it is quite enjoyable for those of fans of this sort of comedy. As a rewatch 02/27/20' Happy Gilmore remains an enjoyable and fun positive watch.~Floated2 rated 8/10 on 9 August 2016"," Average comedy with energy and a few genuine laughs (but mostly goofball ones): Frustrated ice hockey player Happy Gilmore will never make it into the sport despite his intense hitting strength and aggressive game.  When he is seen by ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson, on a driving range, Happy is offered the chance to enter a golf contest.  When his Grandma's house is repossessed, Happy enters in order to make money quickly.  However soon it becomes about more than money as pro Shooter McGavin tries to show him up.Those watching an Adam Sandler comedy usually are prepared for the type of humour that they are about to experience.  I know I didn't sit down expecting clever, witty word play or an intricate, playful script that toys with my emotions. No, I knew that I was ready for the man-child's clowning and lots of dumb, silly jokes.  So I actually quite enjoyed my time spent watching this film as I knew what I was getting into.  The plot is simply dumb but of course that's the point!  The fun is supposed to be in watching Happy getting where he's going rather than wondering if he'll come out on top or not.The jokes are pretty run of the mill for Sandler.  They all have a certain quality that will raise a vague smile often enough to enjoy, but doesn't really ever make you laugh out loud more than a handful of times.  Of course for lots of times, Sandler's overacting (or overreacting!) makes things funnier and he does an OK job with the material.  The actual role is the same one he always plays and is not hard for him.  Guest is better with witty support but Sandler pretty much runs the film without ruining it.While it didn't totally grab my full attention and have me rolling, it was amusing and light enough not to have to concentrate on  which is what I was looking for on a cold Saturday afternoon.  Not really worth checking out if you can't stand Sandler, but neutrals on the subject (such as me) will find it passable enough comedy. Die hard fans will, of course, love it to death but fear not, for a vengeful God awaits them!~bob the moo rated NA on 19 October 2003", Really funny: This is one of Adam Sandler's best works. He has a totally zany and crude sense of humour that really pays off in this scenario. He totally invests in his role with an exaggerated gusto and this is what really makes the film hilarious.~briancham1994 rated 9/10 on 20 August 2020

The plot is predictable and one we have all seen before however it must be watched on the basis it is a family film and meant to appeal to younger viewers as well. On this basis if like me you have children of a younger age who like football, then it is highly likely they will find this story highly engaging. With a strong British cast and references to Matt Busby and his 'Busby Babes' this is also a film that can be enjoyed by adults as well. Brian Cox is good as Matt Busby and there is also a nice performance from Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead). The young actors all do good jobs as well. Believe works as an uplifting and at times touching family drama and as far as family films go this is a very good one. A film that all the family really can enjoy.~MattyGibbs rated 8/10 on 29 August 2014"," A great family film: A feel good family film that will be enjoyed by all ages, especially if you're a fan of Matt Busby and/or have knowledge of the Busby Babes. However all the kids in the cinema who knew nothing about the history loved the film. It's raw and unpolished which gives it its charm. The kids in the film are all newcomers, but do a great job. The emotional scene in the car with Matt and Georgie is brilliant! I saw an interview with Brian Cox who said that even established actors find it difficult to ""dig deep"" to find such emotion. Young Georgie ""blew him away"". Comical in parts, emotional (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the flashbacks to the Busby Babes) and you leave feeling uplifted and happy!~ggwen-609-101621 rated 7/10 on 1 August 2014"," What's not to like?: I felt I needed to add a review for this movie based on the semi-negative review given by another reviewer. He stated that if you're looking for a good movie about football, you should look elsewhere. In essence he's right, but therein lies his problem.Saying ""Believe"" is about football is about as right as saying Americans play football and everyone else plays soccer.*****There will be spoilers here***** Yes, there are a lot of clichés in the movie but take them with a grain of salt and move on.Of course ""our team"" wins, of course our star player makes it to the field and of course there's a life lesson in it for EVERYONE but that's what makes it such a great movie.This is one of those movies that you're going to smile, you're going to cry and you're going to laugh but in the end you're going to walk away thinking that maybe there's hope for this world.Sir Matt Busby DID in fact work with kids and although there was never something as dramatic as this happen that we know about does not mean it never could have happened.Some of the acting was brilliant especially from the young ones.All in all, this is one of those movies that you can sit back, relax and enjoy it with your entire family, knowing that you'll be happier for having watched it!~davidfurlotte rated 10/10 on 30 September 2014"," Evocative of my childhood: This is a great true story movie. And its one that you can watch with the whole family, too! It perfectly evokes the England I remember from the early 1980s, as a small boy. Brian Cox always holds your attention, but you're never aware that its Brian Cox, and his work in this film is a perfect example of that. Phillip Jackson, who I often forget is Phillip Jackson is exemplary in his ordinariness, which is to say that he is completely at ease within his character. He is a great English actor. The passion for football (Soccer) that lives within most English children is alive and well in this seven-a-side team that sees it as a natural process of life. The children are exactly the way my football mad friends were, and like us, they're no angels. But you'll love them anyway!~p.newhouse@talk21.com rated 10/10 on 30 December 2014"," Oh Manchester, so much to answer for.: Believe is a British football movie that finds the legendary Sir Matt Busby (Brian Cox) coaching a kids 7 a side football team. Matt Busby was the manager of Manchester United Football Club, who lost their team of starlets (known as The Busby Babes) to the Munich air crash of 1958. Busby would then go on to rebuild the team and make them into a world force, one that still exists today. Here he is in long retirement exile, but still moulding young football minds. It's based on true events.We have a heavy dose of sentimentality on offer here, not just with the flashbacks to the tragic loss of The Busby Babes, but also to the working class kids of terrace housed Manchester. Of single parents trying to make ends meet, of kids with absent fathers erring on the wrong side of the law, education a dangled carrot just out of reach.However, the sentimentality is not cloying, it's well handled and performed, but the pic never gets to uplift status. It has some good laughs in the mix, usually when Toby Stephens' pompous school tutor is on screen, while the ultimate conclusion - even though it's what we expect - warms the cockles, but it never branches out to be more than just a family film for kiddies who like football, or for Manchester folk eager for anything involving Sir Matt Busby. It makes for a decent ""B"" movie support to There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, though not nearly as good as that film. Cox, Stephens and the tender Busby Babes sequences (very Field of Dreams) make it worth a watch, but it should have been smarter and better. 6/10~hitchcockthelegend rated 6/10 on 15 May 2015"," sentimental beyond belief!: Why am I wasting my time writing a review for this very average film? Maybe I'm bored at work? I should of really known better, and did a bit research, this is after all, is a family film. So I guess if you're an 8 year footballer you'll prob love it. The problem I had it was way to sentimental for my liking. Apart from a few decent tunes from Manchester the music was terrible. It all felt very low budget, the acting was fine but far to clichéd, but if you're a kid you prob wont notice.Basically, I would avoid this film if you're expecting a decent football film and you are above the age of 10.~darren-153-890810 rated 5/10 on 28 July 2014",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available
